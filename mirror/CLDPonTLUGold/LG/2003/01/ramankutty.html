	<h2><a name="ss1" id="ss1"></a>1. Review</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>In <a 
href="../issue81/ramankutty.html">part 1</a> we looked at the basic syntactic 
	  structure of Ruby. In <a 
href="../issue83/ramankutty.html">part 2</a> we discussed iterators and the fundamentals 
	  of Object-Oriented Programming. Here in part 3 we explore object-orientedness 
	  in more detail. </p>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss2" id="ss2"></a>2. Methods</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>A method is an action the object knows how to perform on request. Let's 
	  see an example of how a method is invoked for an object: </p>
	<pre class="sample">print "asdfgh".length
^D
6
</pre>
	<p>One can infer from this that a method named `length' of the String object 
	  is called. </p>
	<p>Now try this: </p>
	<pre class="sample">foo = "abc"
print foo.length,"\n"
foo = [1, 2]
print foo.length,"\n"
^D
3
2
</pre>
	<p>From the result it is clear that deciding which method to call is done 
	  at execution time, and that the choice differs depending on the content 
	  of the variable. </p>
	<p>I suggest that readers not bother about how the object determines its length 
	  because the process is different for strings and arrays. Fortunately, Ruby 
	  automatically chooses the correct process, so we don't have to worry about 
	  it. This feature in languages supporting object orientedness is called polymorphism. 
	</p>
	<p>It is not necessary for the user to know how the methods are processed, 
	  but one has to know what methods are acceptable to the object. When an object 
	  receives an unknown method, an error is raised. For example: try calling 
	  the "length" method for the object "foo" with value "5". </p>
	<p>I had mentioned about a special variable self in Ruby. It is the object 
	  which calls methods. Such callings are used very often and so an abbreviation 
	  is available. That is; </p>
	<pre class="sample">self.method_name(arguments...)
</pre>
	<p>can be omitted then </p>
	<pre class="sample">method_name(arguments...)
</pre>
	<p>causes same effect. Called function is just an abbreviation for method 
	  calling to self. </p>
</div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss3" id="ss3"></a>3. Classes</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>The real world consists of objects which can be classified. For example, 
	  a one-year-old child may think `bowwow' on seeing a dog or even a fox. In 
	  terms of object orientedness, `bowwow' can be termed class, and an object 
	  belonging to a class is called instance. </p>
	<p>In Ruby, as in other object oriented languages, we first define a class 
	  to determine the behaviour of the object, and then make an instance of the 
	  class, a specific object. So let's define a class in Ruby. </p>
	<pre class="sample">class Dog
	def bark
		print "Bow wow\n"
	end
end
^D
</pre>
	<p>The definition of the class lies between the keywords `class' and `end'. 
	  A `def' in class syntax defines a method of the class. </p>
	<p>Now that we have a class named `Dog', let's make an object. </p>
	<pre class="sample">tommy = Dog.new
tommy.bark
^D
Bow wow
</pre>
	<p>This makes a new instance of the class Dog and substitutes it into the 
	  variable tommy. The method `new' of any class makes a new instance. Now 
	  the variable tommy has properties defined in the class Dog, and so he can 
	  `bark'. </p>
</div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss4" id="ss4"></a>4. Inheritence</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Ever wondered how others classify objects? One example is how people perceive 
	  a dog. A mathematician may see a dog as an object made up of different numbers 
	  and figures, a physicist may see it as the result of many natural and artificial 
	  forces at work, and my sister (a zoologist) may interpret it as a representative 
	  of the species canine domesticus. To her, a dog is a kind of canine, a canine 
	  is a kind of mammal, and a mammal is always an animal. </p>
	<p>Hence we see that the classification of objects takes the form of a hierarchy, 
	  though not in all cases. Let's see what Ruby does with it. </p>
	<pre class="sample">class Animal
	def breath
		print "inhales and breaths out\n"
	end
end
class Cat&lt;Animal
	def bark
		print "mew\n"
	end
end
tama = Cat.new
tama.breath
tama.bark
^D
inhales and breaths out
mew
</pre>
	<p>Here the Cat class isn't given any definitions on how to breathe, but it 
	  will inherit that property from the Animal class. In this case, the `bark' 
	  feature is just appended. </p>
	<p>It is notable that the properties of the parent class or the super class 
	  is not always inherited. For example, birds fly, but penguins don't. Penguins 
	  do have other properties of birds, though, like laying eggs. This kind of 
	  thing can be represented in Ruby also, and I leave it to the reader as home 
	  work. </p>
	<p>To make a new class using inheritence from a superclass that holds common 
	  properties, we only need define the differences from the superclass. Some 
	  say this `differential programming' is one of the merits of object oriented 
	  programming. </p>
</div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss5" id="ss5"></a>5. Redefining Methods</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>We can observe difference in behaviour of the instances in subclasses when 
	  we redefine the superclass methods. See below: </p>
	<pre class="sample">class Human
	def print_id
		print "I'm a human.\n"
	end
	def train_toll(age)
		print "reduced-fare.\n" if age &lt; 12
	end
end
Human.new.print_id
class Student1&lt;Human
	def print_id
		print "I'm a student.\n"
	end
end
Student1.new.print_id
class Student2&lt;Human
	def print_id
		super
		print "I'm a student too.\n"
	end
end
Student2.new.print_id
^D
I'm a human.
I'm a student.
I'm a human.
I'm a student too.
</pre>
	<p>In the new classes that redefine the superclass methods, the original method 
	  of superclass can be called using `super'. Along with the code above, try 
	  this: </p>
	<pre class="sample">class Student3&lt;Human
	def train_toll(age)
		super(11) # unconditionally reduced
	end
end
Student3.new.train_toll(25)
^D
reduced-fare.
</pre>
	<p>These are simple examples, but I hope they give you and idea of how inheritance 
	  and redefinition works. </p>
</div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss6" id="ss6"></a>6. More on Methods</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>There are some methods which play the role of restricting the way a method 
	  is called. For a function (defined at top level) given below: </p>
	<pre class="sample">def sqr(x)
	x * x
end
print sqr(5)
^D
25
</pre>
	<p>When `def' appears outside of class definition, it has effect of adding 
	  this method to the Object class. The Object class is the base class of all 
	  other classes- all classes inherit from the class Object. The means that 
	  the method `sqr' can be used in all other classes. </p>
	<p>Now that all classes must be able to call `sqr', let's try to call `sqr' 
	  to `self': </p>
	<pre class="sample">print self.sqr(5)
^D
ERR: private method `sqr' called for (Object)
</pre>
	<p>Calling the function using `self' after the definition of the function 
	  gives the error as shown above. The error message is not intuitive, so what 
	  does it mean? </p>
	<p>What is happening is that a method that is defined at the top levelcan 
	  can be called using function style as opposed to method style. See what 
	  error message you get when undefined methods are called. </p>
	<p>Since methods are called in a function type style, it works in a fashion 
	  similar to that of C++, while calls are within the class or its subclass. 
	</p>
	<p>We can restrict access to methods using `public' or `private' - public 
	  methods can be called by users of the class, while private methods can only 
	  be called by other methods inside this class. </p>
	<pre class="sample">class Test
	def foo
		print "foo\n"
	end
	private foo:
	def bar
		print "bar -&lt; "
	foo
	end
end
temp = Test.new
temp.foo
temp.bar
^D
ERR: private method `foo' called for (Test)
bar -&lt; foo
</pre>
	<p>The concept must be clear with the kind of output obtained. </p>
</div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss7" id="ss7"></a>7. Singleton Method</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>The behaviour of an instance is determined by the class, but we know that 
	  a particular instance should have special behavior. In most languages, we 
	  must make another class for the instance, while in Ruby we can append methods 
	  to a paticular instance without much fuss. </p>
	<pre class="sample">class SingletonTest
        def size
                print "25\n"
        end
end
t1=SingletonTest.new
t2=SingletonTest.new
def t2.size
        print "10\n"
end
t1.size
t2.size
^D
25
10
</pre>
	<p>Here t1 and t2 belong to the same class, though, t2 redefines the `size' 
	  method so it will behave differently. A method of a particular instance 
	  is called singleton method. </p>
	<p>One example where singleton methods are used is in the buttons of a GUI 
	  program, where each button has a different action. We can redefine the action 
	  suitably for each button object. </p>
</div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss8" id="ss8"></a>8. Modules</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Modules in Ruby are very similar to classes, but are used to group related 
	  classes together. There are three major differences between modules and 
	  classes: </p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Modules have no instance. </li>
	  <li>Modules have no subclass. </li>
	  <li>Modules are defined by <tt>module ... end</tt>. </li>
	</ol>
	<p>Roughly saying, there are two uses of modules. First, to collect methods 
	  or constants. For example: </p>
	<pre class="sample">print Math::PI,&quot;\n&quot;
print Math.sqrt(2),&quot;\n&quot;
^D
3.141592654
1.414213562
</pre>
	<p>The operator `::' refers to a constants in a module or class. When we refer 
	  directly to the methods or the constants of a method, we use the `include' 
	  method. </p>
	<pre class="sample">include Math
print sqrt(2),&quot;\n&quot;
print PI,&quot;\n&quot;
^D
1.414213562
3.141592654
</pre>
	<p>Another use of modules is called `mixin'. This can be complex so should 
	  be explained in detail. </p>
	<p>In some Object-Oriented programming languages, a class can inherit from 
	  more than one superclass; this feature is called multiple-inheritance. Ruby 
	  purposely doesn't have this feature. Instead, we can make it by mixin with 
	  the module. </p>
	<p>As said above, the module works like the class; the methods or the constants 
	  of a module cannot be inherited, but instead are appended to other modules 
	  or classes by use of include. So, when one includes the definition of a 
	  module, this adds the property (mixes the property) into the class. </p>
	<p>mixin modules appear in the standard library, and by mixing in these modules 
	  to a class whose the `each' method returns each element, the class get the 
	  features: `sort', `find', etc. </p>
	<p>The following differences exist between multiple-inheritance and mixin: 
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The module don't generate instances; it is a guarantee for the abstract 
		class. </li>
	  <li>The module keeps the relationship of instance to be a tree. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>These differences inhibit complex relationships between classes; simplicity 
	  is a good thing. This is why Ruby doesn't have multiple inheritance. In 
	  languages that have multiple inheritance, situations can occur where classes 
	  have many superclasses and the relationship of instances form a tangled 
	  network... Situations like this are too complex to understand for the brain 
	  of the human being, or at least my brain... </p>
	<p>On the other hand, mixins make it simple as just `the collection of particular 
	  properties all we want to add'. </p>
	<p>So, even in a language with multiple inheritance, it is recognized that 
	  it is good to extend classes by using mixin rather than developing complicated 
	  inheritance relationships. We advanced this idea in Ruby allowing mixins 
	  only instead of multiple inheritance. </p>
</div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss9" id="ss9"></a>9. Procedure Objects</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Suppose you are writing a program that does something to process signals. 
	  Those familiar with it will understand the simplicity in sending a procedure 
	  as an argument to a method (here usually arrival of signals). </p>
	<p>The built-in method proc generates a procedure object. The procedure code 
	  goes between braces, and to execute the procedure object one uses the call 
	  method. See below: </p>
	<pre class="sample">obj = proc{print "Hello world\n"}
obj.call
^D
Hello world
</pre>
	<p>C programmers will find procedure objects similar to function pointers. 
	</p>
</div>

  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>With this, we come to an end of the series of articles Part 1, Part 2 and 
	  Part 3 with which I have intended to give readers a basic introduction to 
	  programming in Ruby. I have not tried to present hard core programming in 
	  Ruby: this is my final year of Engineering, and I am busy with my final 
	  year project and have been unable to look deeply into Ruby. But I know that 
	  as time permits, I will come up with much more in Ruby. </p>
	<p>Happy Programming...</p>
