  <div> 
	<h2>摘要Colour text, keyboard and mouse under DOS and the Linux console </h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>When I began using Linux I noticed that most Linux text editors are rubbish, 
	  having little or no mouse support, no shift-selection and no menus or file 
	  open dialogs. So I thought I could make a contribution, by writing an editor 
	  which had all the features we have come to associate with DOS editors, for 
	  the Linux console. Why shouldn't the better OS have editors which are at 
	  least as good? </p>
	<p>So I searched for a library that would give me a colour text-mode interface 
	  to both platforms and I found Slang and curses. Neither were satisfactory. 
	  In order to provide an interface to a huge list of platforms, many features 
	  possible at the Linux console were disabled. Also, they were so big there 
	  was no prospect of customising them for my own needs and bundling the modified 
	  versions with my own sources. Out of frustration I set out to write my own. 
	</p>
	<p>I set myself the target of producing an interface with the widest possible 
	  range of ctrl- and alt- key combinations, a function to report the state 
	  of shift, ctrl and alt keys, full mouse reporting (including movement) and 
	  direct access to a screen array of EGA-style character-colour pairs. I hoped 
	  to produce something small and simple enough for programmers to bundle with 
	  their own source, so they could modify it if they wish and distribute with 
	  confidence. </p>

  </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss1" id="ss1"></a>1. The Mouse</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Programming for the mouse was relatively easy. Under DOS, I just used int86 
	  and Ralf Brown's Interrupt List. Under Linux, I struggled for a while and 
	  eventually mastered the gpm mouse driver, which has pretty good docs and 
	  demo programs. </p>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss2" id="ss2"></a>2. The Screen</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Finding out how to output colour text to the Linux screen was more of a 
	  struggle. I was saved by an article at Linux Gazette called <a href="../issue65/padala.html">&quot;So 
	  You Like Color!!!&quot;</a>. I was shocked at what it said. </p>
	<p>Unlike DOS, under which characters and colours are written directly to 
	  video memory as byte pairs, the Linux screen is refreshed by using fwrite 
	  to write to stdout! Instead of a colour being written with each character, 
	  the output colour must be changed whenever a character is a different colour 
	  to the one written before it. Changing the output colour involves writing 
	  an 11-byte string to stdout. </p>
	<p>Consequently, screen refresh is very slow under Linux. I did what I could 
	  to speed it up. I keep a duplicate screen buffer which is updated as the 
	  screen is refreshed. Comparing this to the screen buffer, I refresh only 
	  parts of the screen which have changed. Even so, screen refresh takes twenty 
	  times as long under Linux as it does under DOS. </p>
	<p>It is possible to access video memory in recent versions of Linux, by opening 
	  /dev/vcsa as a file. (see man vcs for details) There are two reasons not 
	  to do this. One is that only programs run by the superuser are allowed to 
	  do it. The second is that only the US ASCII character set is supported. 
	  At least with fwrite, the local character set is respected, which is important 
	  because Linux is an international thing, from its friendly welcome screen 
	  to its big, warm heart. </p>
	<p>I found out how to show, hide and position the text cursor by examining 
	  the Slang sources and by using an excellent program bundled with Slang, 
	  called untic. Untic reads the terminfo database and translates it into human-readable 
	  form. (The terminfo database contains the command strings to write to stdout 
	  to perform control operations on any terminal.) </p>
	<p>There was one little niggle. Under Linux, box-drawing characters are not 
	  part of the default character set. ASCII values which produce boxes under 
	  DOS produce funny foreign letters under Linux unless you send a string to 
	  stdout to switch to the alt character set. Switching to that charset permanently 
	  was not an option. I wanted the library to be international like Linux, 
	  supporting international character sets, so what to do? </p>
	<p>I decided to use the high bit of the colour byte as a box bit. Programmers 
	  wishing to draw boxes would have to set the box bit in the colour for any 
	  characters they wish to be shown as box characters. This meant that blinking 
	  text would not be available, because the high bit is otherwise used for 
	  that, but I was happy. I never liked blinking text anyway. </p>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss3" id="ss3"></a>3. The Keyboard</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Interpreting keyboard events on either platform is a giant screaming nightmare 
	  on stilts. Under DOS, the BIOS scancodes are so illogically allocated, they 
	  might as well be random numbers. Under Linux, the terminal has to be specially 
	  prepared and then, the function keys generate strings of bytes which need 
	  to be converted to scancodes through a lookup table. </p>
	<p>It was almost inconceivable to convert Linux key events to DOS, or vice 
	  versa. I decided instead, to produce a pure key function, which would report 
	  a key value which is unaffected by control or alt, but will be shifted if 
	  shift is pressed. Programmers wishing to use a ctrl- or alt-key combination 
	  for a hot key could examine the keyboard status word seperately. </p>
	<h3><a name="ss3.1" id="ss3.1"></a>3.1 The DOS Keyboard</h3>
	<p>You might hope that a two-byte BIOS scancode would use the high byte as 
	  a key ID which never varies and the low byte for an ASCII value which depends 
	  on whether shift, control or alt are pressed. Unfortunately, because of 
	  a need to maintain compatability with the old XT keyboard, the high byte 
	  varies as much much as the low byte. What is worse, different keys react 
	  differently to control and alt. To avoid a time-consuming switch block, 
	  I produced a tangle of &quot;if&quot; tests to sieve the identities out 
	  of ctrl'd and alt'd scancodes. </p>
	<p>Then I found that holding down shift reverses the sense of the numlock 
	  under DOS, but not Linux. I had to complicate my key purifier still further 
	  to undo that stupidity, so numlock means numbers, no matter what. So DOS 
	  was conquered and I faced the horror of the Linux keyboard. </p>
	<h3><a name="ss3.2" id="ss3.2"></a>3.2 The Linux Keyboard</h3>
	<p>In its default state, the Linux keyboard is far from suitable for an interactive 
	  program. The <code>fgetc()</code> function does not return until return is pressed, 
	  then it returns a whole string at once, so moving the cursor with arrows 
	  can't work. It echoes characters to the screen and ctrl-z, ctrl-q and ctrl-s 
	  all generate interrupts. It's a nightmare. </p>
	<p>I had hoped I could avoid using <code>fgetc()</code> and slip the keyboard 
	  into raw mode (pure scancodes), but the gpm mouse driver offered me no choice. 
	  It provides a single function to read events from both keyboard and mouse, 
	  and the keyboard part uses <code>fgetc(stdin)</code>. There is a mouse-only 
	  polling function, but I couldn't make it work. </p>
	<p>I am glad of that now, because I have realised since that <code>fgetc()</code> 
	  receives high-level keycodes which are likely to be the same on foreign 
	  keyboards, where the layout and probably the scancodes would be different. 
	  I resigned myself to translating strings of bytes into scancodes as a necessity 
	  and it turned out to be easier than dealing with BIOS scancodes under DOS 
	  had been. </p>
	<p>I found out how to set up the terminal by examining the Slang sources. 
	  You use a function called <code>tcsetattr()</code> to set flags and values in 
	  a terminal control structure. So I fixed the keyboard to return characters 
	  immediately without echo and to treat ctrl-z, ctrl-q and ctrl-s as ordinary 
	  keys. </p>
	<p>I still had no <code>kbhit()</code> function, nor any way to read the shift 
	  state (whether ctrl, alt or shift are pressed). Google turned up an article 
	  at Linux Gazette called <a href="../issue76/marinov.html">"Taming the Linux 
	  Keyboard"</a>, which gave me both those functions, full source code. </p>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss4" id="ss4"></a>4. The Final Trial</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Still one bugbear remained. It may seem trivial to you but it was everything 
	  to me. It seemed insurmountable and I don't mind admitting, it nearly broke 
	  me. </p>
	<p>You know how on DOS editors you can select text by holding down shift while 
	  using cursor-movement keys, including page up and page down? Well under 
	  Linux, shift-PageUp and shift-PageDown are reserved for a pointless function 
	  called scrollback. That means applications receive nothing from <code>fgetc()</code> 
	  when shift-PageUp/Down are pressed. The kernel spirits these keys away and 
	  your program never sees them. </p>
	<p>But that is not the worst of it by a long chalk. After weeks of brain-busting 
	  work I found out at the final furlong, that if a user tries to select text 
	  with shift-PageUp, half my lovely colour text screen disappears - scrolled 
	  back! </p>
	<p>There was no way I could release my library now. I felt like I had read 
	  a thousand-page novel and found the last page missing. I went round and 
	  round in circles of man pages and info files and searched the net to no 
	  avail. Then I noticed that the <code>shift_state()</code> function I got from 
	  that article I mentioned earlier, used a function called <code><b>ioctl()</b></code> 
	  to work its magic. </p>
	<p>I used <code>"apropos ioctl"</code> to search the man pages and found one 
	  called <code>"console_ioctls"</code>. There I discovered that <code>ioctl()</code> 
	  is the Linux equivalent of a DOS interrupt call. The same page gave a full 
	  list of low-level system calls and a warning from a kernel programmer, never 
	  to use these because they are <U>not guaranteed</U> and are <U>subject to 
	  change</U> in future versions of the kernel. </p>
	<p>But we all know we can ignore kernel programmers when they say things like 
	  that. They are just denying responsibility, like when Scotty tells Captain 
	  Kirk it's going to take twice as long as it really will. </p>
	<p>In the list I found one to change the functions associated with keys - 
	  including PageUp and PageDown. It involved filling a struct with three integers, 
	  to indicate which table, which key and which command to assign. The problem 
	  was, there were no docs telling me what these numbers should be, to disable 
	  scrollback for shift-PageUp. </p>
	<p>Further research turned up the kbd package, which contains great docs and 
	  a bunch of utilities for changing the key mapping. You can dump the current 
	  mapping to stdout by running dumpkeys. Here is an excerpt from my dumpkeys 
	  output. Notice that it only gives me one of the three numbers I need - the 
	  keycode. </p>
	<pre class="sample">
keycode 103 = Up              
	alt	keycode 103 = KeyboardSignal  
keycode 104 = Prior
	shift	keycode 104 = Scroll_Backward
keycode 105 = Left            
	alt	keycode 105 = Decr_Console    
keycode 106 = Right           
	alt	keycode 106 = Incr_Console    
keycode 107 = Select          
keycode 108 = Down            
keycode 109 = Next            
	shift	keycode 109 = Scroll_Forward
keycode 110 = Insert          
</pre>
	<p>If you redirect the output into a text file, you can edit it and pass it 
	  to loadkeys to alter the mapping. Experiments revealed that you can delete 
	  most of the file - only leaving the keys you want to change. So I reduced 
	  it to two lines: </p>
	<pre class="sample">
shift	keycode 104 = Scroll_Backward 
shift	keycode 109 = Scroll_Forward
</pre>
	<p>and changed the current functions to the ones for those keys without shift 
	  pressed: </p>
	<pre class="sample">shift	keycode 104 = Prior
shift	keycode 109 = Next
</pre>
	<p>I called the file kmap and ran "loadkeys kmap". Then I tried my test program 
	  and found that scrollback had been disabled - exactly the result I was looking 
	  for. I knew now that it was possible. A peek at the source for loadkeys 
	  revealed that it used the ioctl I had found, to change the key functions, 
	  but I still did not know what numbers to use. </p>
	<p>I had no choice but to use cunning. I found out that loadkeys has a -m 
	  option, to produce a source file, which contains tables of 256 values. I 
	  ran "loadkeys -m kmap" and found it produced one table with 254 null values 
	  and two non-null. Counting elements I found that the non-null elements were 
	  numbered 104 and 109 - the key codes in my kmap file. The values in the 
	  table had to be the values of the "Prior" and "Next" commands. </p>
	<p>I also saw that this table had a number. I tried changing "shift" to "control" 
	  in one of the lines in kmap and got two tables, one for shift and one for 
	  control. In both cases the shift table was table number 1. Along with the 
	  actual values in the table, I had my three numbers. </p>
	<p>To disable scrollback and scroll forward and make shift-PageUp/Down into 
	  ordinary keys, you must save the existing values, then change them and install 
	  an exit routine to restore them to normal function afterwards. </p>
	<p>If you want to disable any key, such as the console switching keys for 
	  example, you will need to mess about like I did with "loadkeys -m" to find 
	  the numbers you are looking for. </p>
	<p>This function changes a key's action and saves the old one in an integer 
	  you pass in by reference (written for gcc): </p>
	<p><a href="misc/bint/kbe.c.txt">(text version of all listings)</a> </p>
	<pre class="sample">

   struct kbentry ke;

   ke.kb_index = keycode;

/* Get old value, return error if table or keycode are duff */
   if( ioctl( fileno(stdin), KDGKBENT, &amp;ke ) )
      return -1;

/* Unless oldvalue ptr is NULL, save old value to restore later */
   if( oldvalue ) *oldvalue = ke.kb_value;

	<h2><a name="ss5" id="ss5"></a>5. Return of the Jedi</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>So I emerged from the dark underworld of the Linux console, prizes in hand, 
	  triumphant. I have made it possible for programmers to write console apps 
	  which behave exactly the same under DOS and Linux and (I think) secured 
	  my place in legend. </p>
	<p>And you know what? I never did write that text editor. I can't because 
	  I am homeless and I was lucky to get access to a computer long enough to 
	  do this little thing. Perhaps that is where you come in. </p>
	<p>Linux is a virgin territory, about to be colonized by the people of India 
	  and Africa. They can't afford flash computers that can run X, so they need 
	  console apps. Now even those of you who don't have Linux installed can help 
	  them. </p>
	<p>Linux needs pioneers to carve out the infrastructure before the first big 
	  wave of settlers can move in. Those settlers will need configuration dialogs 
	  for common apps like Apache and for common filters like grep. They will 
	  need a good text editor, with a right-click cut-copy-paste menu. </p>
	<p>Programmers who mean to produce these tools will need a widget library 
	  and especially, a file Open/Save dialog. They would benefit from a well-written 
	  string array class with cut-copy-paste functions, provided separately to 
	  be used in various, competing text editors. </p>
	<p>The perfect editor wouldn't have many features, but would have a simple 
	  facility for adding functions to its menus. It would be set up so that any 
	  fool could write a C++ function which takes a pointer to an editor as an 
	  argument and add that function to the editor's menu, just by adding a single 
	  line to <code>main()</code>. Programmers could swap C++ editor functions with 
	  eachother and we would be on course to the ultimate editor. </p>
	<p>Will you be a pioneer? If no-one bothers, I fear that Linux may fall and 
	  we may all end up the helpless playthings of the evil Darth Gates. So I 
	  am hoping you will pick up my fallen standard. You may be our last, our 
	  only hope. Good luck. </p>
	<p>May the Source be with you. </p>
