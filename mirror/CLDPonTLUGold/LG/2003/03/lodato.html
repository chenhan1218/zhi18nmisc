<p> Because the baby-boom generation will soon be the senior population,
the market for voice-activated telephone services will be tremendous.
An open-minded company such as IBM or Hewlett-Packard will surely find a
way to meet the market demand.      What is needed by this aging
population is a unified messaging system -- preferably voice-activated
-- that lets the user check for caller ID, receive short messages, check
for incoming and outgoing e-mail, access address books for both
telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, and place telephone calls. </p>
<p> Everything that is now done by typing and text will be more quickly
and easily performed with voice recognition.  That is, a voice will
identify a caller, read short messages aloud, provide e-mail services in
both text-to-voice reading of the incoming e-mail and voice-to-text for
outgoing e-mail, voice access of address books, and voice-activated
placing phone calls (and ending them when you're done). Once the users
are able to answer, make and end a call using just their voices,
working with the telephone will be a breeze and seniors will not feel
isolated and lonely.  What a boon to society voice-activated telephone
services will be.      Whether or not users are at all computer-savvy,
e-mail will also be an option applied to the telephone.  It is, after
all, a form of communication as is the telephone. It is a Linux-based
unified communication system. </p>
<p> Of great value to the user would be e-mail and its corresponding
address book.  As e-mail comes  in, messages could be read by way of a
text-to-voice method. Also of great value would be a telephone system
with its corresponding address book and numbers.  Short messaging could
be read through text-to-voice technology and short messages can be left
using voice-to-text methodology. </p>
<p> One of the most advanced and productive uses of such simple
Linux-based communication devices is to search the web without going
on-line to a  search engine. Instead, one can just send an e-mail to
Agora in Japan and do multiple Google searches with a single e-mail. You
do not even need a browser.  For example, we are interested how Linux
has been recently doing in the press in connection with the life
sciences and medical applications. Just send a single e-mail to a free
service such as <strong>Agora at dna.affrc.go.jp</strong>. In the body
of a single e-mail one can put a number of searches. Of course, one can
modify the search terms: </p>
<pre>Send http://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+press+2003+life*sciences\&amp;num=50<br><br>Send http://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+press+2003+medical*devices\&amp;num=50<br><br>Send http://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+press+2003+telemedicine\&amp;num=50<br></pre>
<p> Within thirty minutes or so, depending on the time of the day and
the load the Agora server is under, you get a number of e-mails back,
one for each send command in your email. Each e-mail lists the URLs,
accompanied by a one-paragraph review of the corresponding web site,
which fits the keywords one has specified in the send command. Then just
simply select the reference number next to the URL you are interested
in and list them in a reply email back to Agora, and they will send the
web page you have selected. Or you can use the deep command to get the
entire web-site for the URL. To learn more send a Help e-mail to the
Agora server for details. </p>
<p> How productive one can get, but do not abuse these fine services
since they are for the researchers. Use it when it's nighttime in Japan:
after 7pm on the US west coast, after 4pm on the US east coast, and
after 11am in western Europe. </p>
<p> Anything that allows independence for the user is bound to be
helpful to every aspect of society. </p>
<p> With the attractive price of a Linux-based unified communication
device encompassing all the applications mentioned above, users can be
connected and productive without the need for an expensive Windows
system. </p>

<p> There's a list of Agora and www4mail servers at <a
 href="http://www.expita.com/servers.html">http://www.expita.com/servers.html</a>.
Two other (less reliable) Agora servers are <strong>agora at
kamakura.mss.co.jp</strong> (Japan) and <strong>agora at
www.eng.dmu.ac.uk</strong> (UK). </p>
<p> Www4mail is a very modern type of server that works similar to
Agora. Two servers the author has tested are <strong>www4mail at
kabissa.org</strong> and <strong>www4mail at web.bellanet.org</strong>.
Send an e-mail with the words "SEND HELP" in the body for instructions.</p>
