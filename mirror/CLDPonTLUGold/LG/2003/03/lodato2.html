<blockquote><em> The most important capital of an alliance: people,
successfully collaborating via the Internet. </em></blockquote>
<p> Hope springs eternal at the World Internet Center (The Center) in
Palo Alto, California.  Located in an upstairs suite at the historic
Stanford Barn, The Center hosts a weekly social event on Thursdays from
5 to 7 PM called "the Pub". Aside from sushi and wine provided by The
Center at nominal cost to those who attend, the networking that takes
place at the Pub offers hope to millions of people. </p>
<p> The Center brings hope by connecting Silicon Valley entrepreneurs,
corporate executives and technologists, all wanting to forge a start-up
company that will make a mark on today's economy using info-tech such as
the Internet.  From the business opportunities that develop, the
beneficiaries of such opportunities are not just the businessmen putting
together the deal. In the long run, the beneficiaries may also include
people around the world afflicted with physical malfunctions and
illnesses. </p>
<p> The Pub allows people to put together start-up firms of varying
interests. Small, narrowly-focused companies such as those concentrating
on life sciences, soon to be headquartered in Singapore, rely on larger
businesses to disseminate their services and capabilities. These
larger businesses are called systems integrators. </p>
<p> Visitors to The Center come from as far away as Russia, Australia,
Iran, Europe, China, Japan, Chile, Brazil and, of course, from Silicon
Valley. California's Silicon Valley is the Mecca of high technology:
telecom, multimedia telecom, computers, Internet and e-commerce,
attracting countries wanting to ride the high-tech wave of the future
because of its potential for financial gain. </p>
<p> Because people forming a team and working well together as a group
make for the success of a new company, the elbow-rubbing they do
socially at the Pub is an indication of how things will work out in the
long run.  People make the deal work, not technology, not ideas, not
money, but people with those things.  If new businesses can speed along
medical help for people with all sorts of physical malfunctions, The
Center will have achieved a major milestone: lowering the cost of
medicine and improving the lives of the needy. </p>
<p> The main theme of The Center is to connect its current and past
large corporate sponsors such as Amdocs, Deutsche Telekom, HP, IBM, SAP,
Sun with with small high-tech companies and expert individuals in the
form of a series of focused think-tanks. </p>
<p> Because my husband, Laszlo Rakoczi, a Hungarian revolutionary who
emigrated to the USA after the revolution in Hungary was crushed by the
Evil Empire (the Soviet Union), is a member of the Advisory Board of
The Center, many small companies seek him out to discuss the potential
of collaborative strategic alliance type business arrangements. One
such high-tech company recently approaching him is Sensitron.net. Dr.
Rajiv Jaluria, founder and CEO, met Laszlo through The Center.
Sensitron is a small high-tech firm which built an end-to-end system to
connect medical instruments to monitoring stations and databases thus
improving the productivity of the medical professionals and increasing
the quality of medical care. Of course the question of what type of
platform should the application run on came up. Laszlo immediately
introduced the idea of embedded Linux based systems for the medical
instruments as well as for the PDAs and Tablets for the professionals
and even the potential of Linux based servers and databases. Laszlo
suggested these since Linux would allow... </p>
<ul>
  <li> a more reliable end-to-end system </li>
  <li> easier maintenance of the system </li>
  <li> a much lower cost end-to-end system </li>
  <li> application specific, simple, productive GUI for the
professionals </li>
  <li> a GUI for the patients with telephone type simplicity so the can
connect in telemedicine fashion to the professionals supporting them. </li>
</ul>
<p> Laszlo could not resist pointing out that the real Evil Empire which
is holding down and fighting the real revolution -- the simple and low
cost collaboration of all peoples via the Internet, not just the ones
who can pay for the high cost of a Windows based PC -- is Microsoft with
their monopolistic pressure tactics.  One of such evil practices of
Microsoft is the campaign under which they embrace a small company like
Sensitron, enhance their application of Sensitron, then extinguish the
original team. Embrace, enhance, extinguish. The Soviets were never
that good and imaginative in their tyrannical approach. Maybe that is
the reason they have failed. </p>
<p> As the biotech and IT arenas converge, IT enables life sciences
companies to accelerate the development, testing and marketing of their
intellectual properties, products and services.  Life sciences
encompass the fields of biotechnology, medical equipment and
pharmaceutical products and services. Such companies include many small,
as well as large entities like Pfizer, Chiron, Philips and Agilent. </p>
<p> It is hard to believe such a sophisticated, practical idea could
come from people socializing over wine and sushi, but that is indeed the
case.  Many future start-up companies in the Silicon Valley will have
the World Internet Center and its weekly Pub to thank for their
conception. </p>
<p> One such important think tank, currently in formation stages looking
for corporate sponsors, is an NIH-funded project for the disabled, aging
and ailing.  This proposed think tank planning to investigate the
potential of collaborative telemedicine. For example, due to the
shortage of medical professionals, China must use telemedicine to
connect the small clinics in 260,000 communities to the 100 large
teaching hospitals via VSAT type Internet linkage.  NeuSoft of China is
putting together such a system and of course they do not want to fall
prey to Microsoft's overpriced systems. In fact Linux is the major
platform China wants for all their applications supported by  the Red
Flag project. </p>
<p> Telemed systems of this type apply to a very large group, including
disabled, aging and ailing people as well as the professionals
supporting them. The sum of these people account for half the population
of the world and very few of them can afford the artificially high cost
of Windows-based systems. Telemed can lower the cost of medicine,
improve the capabilities of the medical professionals and at the same
time improve the quality of life of the patients. </p>
<p> Sensitron, with the support of NeuSoft will propose that NIH should
provide a grant to their strategic alliance under which a disabled and
female investigator will do a clinical study of the potential of
significantly improved condition of health via Internet-based
collaborative virtual community style involvement.  This significant
upgrade of self-supported health improvement can be achieved using
assistive technologies (AT) connected via the web.  However, such AT
technologies must be upgraded to allow collaboration between the health
service professionals and their patients linked via the virtual
community. The AT based virtual community needs functions such as... </p>
<ul>
  <li> simple and telemed-specific user interface. </li>
  <li> voice based interaction via computer/telephone. </li>
  <li> always-on and always-available systems. </li>
</ul>
<p> An important point: the AT technologies we would apply to the
disabled and the aging can also be used for the eyes-busy, hands-busy
professionals. It could be sold via a for-profit Internet company, with
some of the profits paid back to the non-profit think tank in the form
of grants and matching grants. </p>
<p> Melbourne, Singapore, Dailan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Kuala Lampur,
Munich, Budapest, Vienna, Lund, Bern, Helsinki, Shenyang, Dublin,
London, Stuttgart, Hawaii, Vancouver, Toronto,  etc.,  would all love to
come to Silicon Valley in this virtual community manner, through a club
equipped with a standard wireless local area network (WLAN), connected
to a virtual private network (VPN). This cross-oceanic virtual private
network will have kiosk-based unified messaging (UM) between the clubs.
This would also including very low-cost voice over the Internet
protocol (VoIP) connected in all major APEC, Asian Pacific economic
community, cities with the VoIP and UMoIP as well as through carrier
allies with IP backbone to 120 of the important cities in USA/Canada as
well as many in the EU. </p>
<p> Those of us with neurological dysfunctions such as MS, ALS, ALD,
Parkinsons, Alzheimers and myriad more, have a very special personal
stake in the networking that goes on over sushi and wine.  Life sciences
and information technology working together can aid these patients in a
very effective way. For example, techniques like neuroprosthetics --
interaction with devices using voice and eye signals -- can develop. </p>
<p> As I sit in the only quiet spot at The Center during its weekly,
after-hours social event, I notice the networking that takes place.  The
Center provides a great opportunity for people to share ideas for
business. Everyone from the original architects of the Valley to new
entrepreneurs is there.   Investors look for good investment
opportunities, and start-up companies look for anyone wanting to put
money into their new venture. Basically, it's a people-to-people scene
and is exciting to observe. </p>
<p> Then there are those who find the allure of the event as a singles
bar irresistible.  Where else can they find stimulating company, fresh
sushi and good wine at such a fair price?  Personally, having attended
the weekly occasion for so many months now because my husband, Laszlo,
is a member of The Center's Advisory Board, I could care less if I ever
see sushi again in my life! </p>
<p> By now I have my own circle of friends at this gathering.   And I
find those wanting to do business with my important husband very
courteous and attentive to me.  In general, the entire encounter is an
"upper" for me, a technology midget among giants. </p>
<p> Nibbling on the cheese set before me, my taste for sushi having long
since expired, I fulfill my role as a mouse in the boardroom to the max.
I overhear conversations of businessmen from the already-mentioned
countries exchanging e-mail addresses to further negotiate via the
Internet.   The Center has achieved its goal. </p>
<p> I smile a little inward smile, realizing medical researchers around
the world have been sharing ideas and breakthroughs on the Internet for
years. A medical Manhattan Project has been globalized thanks to the
Internet.  I know a lot of afflicted people who were ready for medical
help yesterday. </p>
<p> What can we do besides raise money to hurry things along?  Hope the
convergence of biotechnology and IT accelerates treatments for physical
malfunctions worldwide and promotes the free exchange of intellectual
property among biotechnology companies and research institutions, that's
what. And keep that sushi and wine readily available for the Thursday
night Pub at the World Internet Center.</p>
