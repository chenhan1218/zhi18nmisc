<p> Title: Unix Storage Management<br>
Authors: Ray A. Kampa, Lydia V. Bell<br>
Publisher: Apress<br>
Year: 2003 </p>
<p> There are some rather complex--and dare I say it--arcane issues
involved in managing storage in a Unix environment. Indeed, Unix storage
management can be a complicated affair. This is especially true when
you consider the many needs business places on storage systems such as
fault tolerance, redundancy, speed, and capacity. Apress has published
a book that they promote as being written specifically about this
topic, which weighs in at a comfortable 302 pages of actual material. </p>
<p> In general, I find <i>Unix Storage Management</i> to be a good
primer on storage management. However, I am a little disappointed in the
lack of focus on actually administering storage. When requesting the
book I assumed that I would learn how to pull up my sleeves and tune and
tweak file system performance, optimize access to network-based
storage, and in general get a real feel for managing storage in a Unix
environment. But alas, that isn't the case. <i>Unix Storage Management</i>
deals mostly with the higher-level details of understanding how storage
works, determining what kind you need, and then working to integrate
that storage into your network. </p>
<p> This isn't to say that the book doesn't do a good job of introducing
the reader to the major components of modern Unix storage systems.
Indeed, technologies covered include RAID, SANS, NAS, and backups, to
name just a few. Kampa and Bell actually do a good job of introducing
this material, but they do not treat the subject matter in great depth.
Essentially, after reading the text, readers will have enough knowledge
to do more research and know what they are looking for, but they
doubtless would not be in a position to actually implement a solution in
a demanding environment. </p>
<p> The target audience for this book, whether intentional or not, are
IT managers and those that want a broad overview of how storage systems
work. Administrators that are in the trenches would also enjoy skimming
this book if for no other reason than to remind themselves of the
technologies available for them. Also, most administrators will look
favorably on the chapter "Performance Analysis", which does a rather
good job of detailing the process of collecting and analyzing
performance information on storage systems. All in all, this is not a
bad book as long as you aren't expecting to walk away with guru-like
powers over Unix storage systems.</p>
