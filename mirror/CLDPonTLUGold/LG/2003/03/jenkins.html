<h2><a name="ss1"></a>1. Yet Another New Desktop Environment?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Actually, it's not. The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) has been
around for as long as some of those who will be reading this article. It
was jointly developed by IBM, Sun, HP and Novell so as to provide a
unified "look and feel" to users of their systems. It was also adopted
by other companies (notably Digital Equipment). You can find further
details at <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/aix/cde/cdewhat.html">
"IBM AIX: What is CDE?"</a>.</p>
<p> [<a href="misc/jenkins/ScreenShot.jpg">Screenshot: a typical CDE
screen</a>] </p>
<p>The early versions of KDE appear to have been based on CDE, and the
more recent releases of XFce have a look-and-feel which is very similar
to that of CDE. A key difference here is that both KDE and XFce are Open
Source developments.<br>
<img src="misc/jenkins/FontSize1.jpg" width="480" height="306"
 border="0" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"
 alt="DeskTop Terminal (dtterm)"></p>
<p>One of the most-used CDE applications is probably its desktop
terminal 'dtterm' which was based on 'xterm' with some extra menu-bar
capabilities; its look is not unlike that of 'gnome-terminal'. There are
also image-viewer, performance-monitoring, mail-reader and other useful
tools.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a name="ss2"></a>2. Why Should I Care?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>I work in an environment where I am required to access and manage a
number of Solaris and HP-UX servers. Most of my work is done at a
NetBSD-based Xterminal, managed by a remote Solaris machine so that I
have a CDE desktop. There are times it is managed instead by a remote
Linux machine so that I have a Gnome desktop. And there are times (too
many of them!) when I work from home, using a Linux machine with a
locally-managed Gnome desktop.<br>
</p>
<p>It matters little where I am working; as soon as I open up a CDE
utility such as 'dtterm', my Xserver starts looking for CDE-specific
fonts. It seems that a number of vendor-supplied backup and other
utilities also make use of these fonts.<br>
</p>
<img src="misc/jenkins/FontSize2.jpg" width="480" height="306"
 border="0" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"
 alt="DeskTop Terminal without Font Support">
<p> </p>
<p>In the case of 'dtterm' the end-result is that an attempt to select
a different-sized font produces a selection list containing eight fonts,
and seven of these can't be found. It is actually possible to get
around this by redefining on the Solaris or HP host the names of the
fonts which are used for the 'dtterm' application. This can be done at
either a system-wide or a user-specific level; either way, it's hardly
an elegant solution.</p>
<p>In the case of a splash-screen produced at CDE-login time, the
result can be quite dire: the user is unable to read the login prompts
or error messages!  More recent versions of both Solaris and HP-UX get
around this by attempting to append an entry like 'tcp/hpmachine:7100'
to the font-path at login time. That's fine unless your site security
policy prohibits the activation of font service on your Solaris and HP
servers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a name="ss3"></a>3. Why Not Use Specialised Font Server Machines?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>You can designate a couple of machines as font-servers for your
site. These can be small dedicated machines, or they can offer other
services (such as DHCP, NTP, etc.) as well. That's actually the way that
it's done with 'thin' Xterminals from companies like IBM, NCD and HP.</p>
<p>There are several issues. First up, you have to actually install the
CDE-fonts on the font-server machines; there may be some copyright
issues here if you are installing (for instance) HP CDE fonts on Linux
machines.</p>
<p>Something we noticed in practice is that the Xserver software we are
using doesn't seem smart enough to do a transparent fail-over in the
event of a  single server disconnection. So what happens is that a user
suddenly finds himself presented with a blank screen.</p>
<p>If you are working from home with a modem connection to the LAN on
which your font-servers reside, it can take some time for required fonts
to arrive when you start a 'dtterm' application.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a name="ss4"></a>4. Install on Every Xserver?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is certainly a possibility, and if you can live with the
copyright issues, it will solve most of the problems outlined above. But
it will require an extra 10Mb of filespace on each system.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a name="ss5"></a>5. There is Another Way!</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The good news is that you don't have to lose sleep over the
copyright issues. And you don't have to install strange fonts all over
your font directories.</p>
<p>All you need do is identify some commonly-available fonts which
closely match the CDE-specific fonts, and create one 'fonts.alias' file.
Place it in an appropriate directory (e.g.
'/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/local'), and run 'mkfontdir' in that
directory. Then ensure that the directory name is included in your
font-server configuration file (e.g. '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fs/config'). If
your version of Linux (or NetBSD, or FreeBSD ..) doesn't include a term
like 'unix/:7100' in its 'XF86Config' (or similar) server configuration
file, you should place the name of your selected font directory in that
configuration file.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a name="ss6"></a>6. The Intimate Details</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Here's what the 'fonts.alias' <a href="misc/jenkins/fonts.alias.txt">
file</a> looks like. For clarity, I've shown just the first two and the
last alias hereunder, and I've broken each line at the whitespace
between the alias-name and it's corresponding real font. There wasn't a
great deal of science went into the development of this file, although I
did use a couple of simple scripts to assemble it.  It was just a
matter of finding, for each alias, a font having similar characteristics
and size.</p>

<h2><a name="ss7"></a>7. Read My Lips</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>OK, so you've read this far, and you're still asking "Why Should I
Care?". My guess is that eighty percent of you have never used CDE and
are unlikely to use it in the future.</p>
<p>But what I can guarantee is that most of you are going to run an
application one day, and wonder why it's fonts don't display or scale
properly. My hope is that when that happens, you'll recall what you've
read here - and apply it to the creation of an appropriate 'fonts.alias'
file as outlined above.</p>
