<div>
<p>When Woomert Foonly answered the door in response to an insistent
knocking, he found himself confronted by two refrigerator-sized (and
shaped) men in dark coats who wore scowling expressions. He noted that
they were both reaching into their coats, and his years of training in
the martial arts and razor-sharp attention to detail resulted in an
instant reaction. </p>
<p>- "Hello - you're obviously with the government, and you're here to
help me, even if didn't call you. May I see those IDs?... Ah. <i>That</i>
agency. Do come in, gentlemen.  Feel free to remove your professional
scowls along with your coats, you won't need them. Pardon me while I
call your superiors just to make sure everything is all right; I need to
be sure of your credentials. Please have a seat." </p>
<p>Some moments later, he put down the phone. </p>
<p>- "Very well; everything seems right. How may I help you, or, more
to the point, help your associates who have a programming problem? I
realize that security is very tight these days, and your organization
prefers face-to-face meetings in a secure environment, so I'm mystified
as to your purpose here; I don't normally judge people by appearances,
but you're clearly not programmers." </p>
<p>The men glanced at each other, got up without a word, and began a
minute security survey of Woomert's living room - and Woomert himself -
using a variety of expensive-looking tools. When they finished a few
minutes later, they once again looked at each other, and nodded in
unison. Then, each of them reached into the depths of their coat and
extracted a rumpled-looking programmer apiece, both of whom they
carefully placed in front of Woomert. The look-and-nod ritual was
repeated, after which they each retired to the opposite corners of the
room to lurk like very large shadows. </p>
<p>Woomert blinked. </p>
<p>- "Well. The requirements of security shall be served... no matter
what it takes. Have a seat, gentlemen; I'll brew some tea." </p>
<p>A few minutes later, after introductions and hot tea - the names of
the human cargo turned out to be Ceedee Tilde and Artie Effem - they got
down to business. Artie turned out to be the spokesman for the pair. </p>
<p>- "Mr. Foonly, our big challenge these days is image processing. As
you can imagine, we get a lot of surveillance data... well, it comes to
us in a standardized format that contains quite a lot of information
besides the image: the IP of the originating site, a comment field,
position information, etc. The problem is, both of us are very familiar
with text processing under Perl but have no idea how to approach
extracting a set of non-text records - or, for that matter, how to avoid
reading in a 200MB image file when all we need is the header info...
I'll admit, we're rather stuck. Our resident C++ guru keeps trying to
convince us that this can only be done in his language of choice - it
wouldn't take him more than a week, or so he says, but we've heard <i>that</i>
story before." After an enthusiastic nod of agreement from Ceedee he
went on. "Anyway, we thought we'd consult you - there just <b>has</b>
to be something you can do!" </p>
<p>Woomert nodded. </p>
<p>- "There is. One thing, though: since we're not dealing with actual
classified data or anything that requires a clearance - I assume you've
brought me a carefully-vetted specification sheet, yes? - I want my
assistant, Frink Ooblick, to be in on the discussion. This is, in fact,
similar to the kind of work he's been trying to do lately, so he should
find it useful as well." </p>
<p>Frink was brought in and debugged by the pair Woomert had dubbed
Strong and Silent, although "perl -d" <a
 href="file:///Data/CLDP/LG/2003/03/tmp/okopnik.html#%5B1%5D">[1]</a>
was nowhere in evidence. After introductions all around, he settled into
his favorite easy chair from which he could see Woomert's screen. </p>
<p>- "All right, let's look at the spec sheet. Hmmm... the header is
1024 bytes; four bytes worth of raw IP address, a forty-byte comment
field, latitude and longitude of top left and bottom right, each of the
four measurements preceded by a length-definition character... well,
that'll be enough for a start; you should be able to extrapolate from
the solution for the above." </p>
<p>"What do you think, Frink? Any ideas on how to approach this one?" </p>
<p>Frink was already sitting back in his chair, eyes narrowed in
thought. </p>
<p>- "Yes, actually - at least the first part. Since they're reading a
binary file, ``read'' seems like the right answer. As for the second...
well, ``substr'', maybe..." </p>
<p>- "Close, but not quite. ``read'' is correct: we want to get a
fixed-length chunk of the file. However, "substr" isn't particularly
great for non-text strings - and hopeless when we don't know what the
field length is ahead of time, as is the case with the four lat/long
measurements. However, we do have a much bigger gun... whoa, boys, calm
down!" he added as Strong and Silent stepped out of their corners, "it's
just a figure of speech!" </p>
<p>"Anyway," he continued, with a twinkle in his eye that hinted at the
"slip" being not-so-accidental, "we have a better <i>tool</i> we can use
for the job, one that's got plenty of pep and some to spare: ``unpack''.
Here, try this: </p>
<pre class="sample"># Code fragment only; actually processing the retrieved data is left as an<br># excercise, etc. :)<br>...<br>$A="file.img";open A or die "$A: $!";read A,$b,1024;@c=unpack "C4A40(A/A)4", $b<br>...<br><br></pre>
<p> The moment of silence stretched until Ceedee cleared his throat. </p>
<p>- "Ah... Mr. Foonly... what the heck is <b>that?</b> I can
understand the ``open'' function, even though it looks sort of odd...
``read'' looks reasonable too... but what's that ``unpack'' syntax? It
looks as weird as snake suspenders." </p>
<p>Woomert glanced around. Artie was nodding in agreement, and even
Frink looked slightly bewildered. He smiled and took another sip of tea. </p>
<p>- "Nothing to worry about, gentlemen; it's just an ``unpack'' <i>template</i>,
a pattern which tells it how to handle the data. Here, I'll walk
through it for you. First, though, let's expand this one-liner into
something a bit more readable, maybe add a few comments: </p>
<pre class="sample"><br>$A = "file.img";		# Set $A equal to the file name<br>open A or die "$A: $!";		# Open using the "new" syntax<br>read A, $b, 1024;		# Read 1kB from 'A' into $b<br>@c = unpack "C4A40(A/A)4", $b;	# Unpack $b into @c per template<br><br></pre>
<p> The new syntax of "open" (starting with Perl 5.6.0) allows us to
"combine" the filehandle name and the filename, as I did in the first
two lines; the name of the variable (without the '$' sigil) is used as
the filehandle. If you take a look at ``perldoc -f pack'', it contains a
longish list of template specifications, pretty much anything you might
want for conversions; you can convert various types of data, move
forward, back up, and in general dance a merry jig. The above was rather
simple, really:<br>
</p>
<pre class="sample">C4	An unsigned "char" value repeated 4 times<br>A40	An ASCII string 40 characters long<br>(A/A)4  ASCII string preceded by a "length" argument which is itself a single <br>            ASCII character, repeated 4 times<br><br></pre>
<p> The resulting output was assigned to @c, which now contains
something like this: </p>
<pre class="sample">$a[0]   The first octet of the IP quad<br>$a[1]    "  second  "    "    "    "<br>$a[2]    "  third   "    "    "    "<br>$a[3]    "  fourth  "    "    "    "<br>$a[4]   The comment field<br>$a[5]   The latitude of the upper left corner<br>$a[6]    "  longitude    "    "    "    "    "<br>$a[7]   The latitude of the lower right corner<br>$a[8]    "  longitude    "    "    "    "    "<br><br></pre>
<p> Obviously, you can extend this process to your entire data layout.
What do you think, gentlemen - does this fit your requirements?"<br>
</p>
<p>After the now-enthusiastic Artie and Ceedee had been bundled off by
their hulking keepers and the place was once again as roomy as it had
been before their arrival, Woomert opened a bottle of Hennessy's
"Paradise" cognac and brought out a pair of small but fragrant cigars
which proved to be top-grade Cohibas. </p>
<p>- "Well, Flink - that's another case solved; something that never
fails to make me feel cheery and upbeat. As for you - hit those books,
young man! - at least when we get done with this little treat. ``perldoc
perlopentut'' will make a good introduction to the various ways to open
a file, duplicate a filehandle, etc.; ``perldoc -f pack'' and ``perldoc
-f unpack'' will explain those functions in detail. When you think
you've got it, find a documented binary file format and write a parser
that will pull out the data for examination. By this time tomorrow, you
should be quite expert in the use of these tools..." </p>

<p><a name="[1]"></a>[1] Perl comes with a very powerful built-in
debugger; see "perldoc perldebtut" and "perldoc perldebug" for more
information. Note, however, that it's not very good at locating hidden
transmitters or wiretaps...</p>

 vspace="10" title=""> Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became
interested in electricity at age six--promptly demonstrating it by
sticking a fork into a socket and starting a fire--and has been falling
down technological mineshafts ever since. He has been working with
computers since the Elder Days, when they had to be built by soldering
parts onto printed circuit boards and programs had to fit into 4k of
memory.  He would gladly pay good money to any psychologist who can
cure him of the resulting nightmares. </p>
<p>Ben's subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a
dozen languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of
a hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. Having recently completed a
seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail, he is currently docked
in Baltimore, MD, where he works as a technical instructor for Sun
Microsystems. </p>
<p>Ben has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his
complete loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the
Pacific Northwest. </p>
