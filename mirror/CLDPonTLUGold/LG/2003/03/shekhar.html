<h2><a name="ss1"></a>1. Chatting / Instant Messaging with Linux </h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3><a name="ss1.1"></a> 1.1 History of chatting</h3>
<p>Many normal users think that GNU/Linux is not for them, but only for
geeks. One reason for this is they believe they can not do the basic
things like chatting under GNU/Linux. They believe that there are no
Instant Messenger clients for Yahoo, MSN, and ICQ in GNU/Linux, but this
is absolutely wrong - chatting was actually first implemented in UNIX.
(Linux is a UNIX like free/open operating system). </p>
<p><tt>talk</tt> was the first chatting program developed from UNIX long
ago when there was no MS trying to capture the Internet. The computing
world was a free land then, and you could share any program with any
one, you could change them too to suit your needs - much like what <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/fsf/fsf.html">Free Software</a> is trying to
do. <tt>talk</tt> is still available with UNIX &amp; GNU/Linux . </p>
<p>From <tt>talk</tt>, other chatting concepts were developed. IRC was
the first to be developed,then other companies came and hence ICQ,
Yahoo, MSN, Jabber, AIM etc. chat systems were developed. </p>
<p>I shall try to touch on each of the chat systems here. <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="ss1.2"></a>1.2 talk<br>
</h3>
<p>It is the most basic chat system but still popular in LAN's. If you
are in a college or office and can access only a UNIX or Linux terminal
then you can chat with your friends. First of all the talk server daemon
must running. </p>
<p>To chat with your friend then all you have to do the following <br>
<tt>[anirban@anirban anirban]$ talk &lt;username&gt;@host &lt;tty&gt;</tt> <br>
i.e. if the user name is raj (it will the same as the login name to the
system) and his host computer is www.anyhost.com then it will be <br>
<tt>[anirban@anirban anirban]$ talk raj@www.anyhost.com</tt> </p>
<p>You may be wondering what <tt>tty</tt> is? Suppose your friend
opened many terminals - the terminal in which you want to send the
message is specified by the tty number. Numbers start from 0 and only
integers are allowed. </p>
<p>You can do the above with <tt>write</tt> too. <br>
<tt>[anirban@anirban anirban]$ write &lt;username@host&gt; &lt;tty&gt;</tt> </p>
<p>If you want not to receive any chat invitition or any chatting then
you have to give the command. <br>
<tt>[anirban@anirban anirban]$ mesg n</tt> <br>
to remove the blocking you have to do <br>
<tt>[anirban@anirban anirban]$ mesg y</tt> </p>
<p>If you a GUI lover and a heavy Yahoo or MSN chatter then you may not
like this kind of chatting, but for many of us who like GNU/Linux this
old system is still gold. <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="ss1.3"></a> 1.3 IRC or Internet Relay Chat</h3>
<p>After <tt>talk</tt> came <i>IRC</i> and it is still popular. I think
that if you really want a high class chatting experience without the
flooding or other bad stuff of Yahoo and MSN, then IRC is the thing for
you. Also, there are many rooms (known as channels in IRC) from where
you can get really good help on GNU/Linux, C/C++ programming,
maintaining your Linux box and much more. (As an aside, in my personal
experience I was a Yahoo chatter and did not get any thing more than
flooding and 4 or 5 guys running for a girl in the room. But from IRC I
received really good help when I was stuck.  IRC can really be a great
source of help.)<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="ss1.3.1"></a> 1.3.1 Basic concept of IRC</h4>
<p>IRC is a little bit different from Yahoo or MSN chat since IRC is
not owned by any company. It is free/open like GNU/Linux and generally
run by volunteers. </p>
<p>The main difference is that you do not have to sign up to get a ID
or password. So what do you do instead? Choose a nickname and a host
(IRC server) to connect to. Since it is not run by a single company you
have to know the host address, like you have to know the URL to visit a
page on Internet. You can get the addresses of different hosts from the
internet and also to which topic it is dedicated; for example,
irc.openprojects.net is dedicated to the betterment of open source
projects and open source developers. </p>
<p>So you have to provide your nickname and the host you want to
connect to. If the nickname you pick is already taken then you'll have
to provide another nickname. </p>
<p>IRC newbies should check out the <a
 href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html">IRC Primer</a>
before using IRC for the first time. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="ss1.3.2"></a> 1.3.2 Software for IRC</h4>
<p>There are many IRC chat applications available but I think <tt>Xchat</tt>
is the best. Most distributions provide it with their installation CDs
and it is often included in default installations. If it isn't already
installed, fear not; you can find it in the installation CDs or download
it from <a href="http://www.xchat.org">http://www.xchat.org</a>. You
will generally find it in RPM format so installation will not be
difficult.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="ss1.3.3"></a> 1.3.3 Configuring Xchat</h4>
<p>After installation type <tt>xchat</tt> in a terminal or click the
xchat icon (you will find it in <tt>`Main Menu &gt; Internet &gt; Chat'</tt>).</p>
<p>The first window of Xchat will appear. Provide the nickname you
would like. You can provide more than one. In case a nickname is already
taken in a room xchat will use the other nickname you provided, else it
will pick the first nickname in the list. You also can provide your real
name and as which user you want to use it - (generally you do not have
to provide all these; the system guesses it for you from your system
login name and real name). </p>
<p>Now choose a host from the list of hosts and double click it or
click on <tt>`Connect'</tt> at the bottom. A new window will open with
some text flowing in it. It will take a little time to connect, then
after connecting it will show the rules you should follow to chat in
this host. Since IRC generally is a volunteer effort by good-at-heart
people and not by any company, please try to follow it or else you may
get banned. Maintainers of IRC chat rooms are very strict about the
rules. (That is why chatting experience is much better here than yahoo
or MSN). </p>
<p>Now you will see a single line text box where you can write both
what you want to say, and also commands to navigate. Commands all start
with a <tt>/</tt> (ie. slash). To get the list of rooms (or channels) in
the host type <tt>/list</tt> . You will see all the rooms, choose the
one which suits you and then type <tt>/join #&lt;roomname&gt;</tt> and
then click <tt>`Enter'</tt>. Please note that you have to always give
the number sign (<tt>#</tt>) before any room name. </p>
<p>Now you will enter that room and start chatting. At the extreme
right there will be the list of all users/chatters in that room;
selecting any one will get info about him /her. You will find many
buttons at the right side of your chat window, by selecting a user and
clicking the buttons you can ban or block a user, get info about
him/her, invite him/her in a personal chat or even transfer files in
IRC. </p>
<p>So I think you will now be able to chat in IRC. Some day you may
even meet me in IRC. I generally live in the host irc.openprojects.net
and in the room linux (you have to give a number sign ie. # before
joining ie. <tt>/join #linux</tt>). <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="ss1.4"></a> 1.4 Instant Messaging</h3>
<h4><a name="ss1.4.1"></a> 1.4.1 ICQ</h4>
<p>There are several <a href="http://www.icq.com/">ICQ</a> chat clients
in GNU/Linux, and <i>Licq</i> is one of the most popular. You will find
it inside the internet or network sections of the main menu i.e. KDE
main menu ( so <tt>`Main Menu &gt; Internet/Networking &gt; Instant
messenger'</tt>) or just type <tt>licq</tt> in a terminal. After
starting for the first time it will want you to register to their server
to get a ID and password. Then you can login with that ID and password
as you do with most of the Window's versions of ICQ clients.</p>
<h4><a name="ss1.4.2"></a> 1.4.2 Yahoo!</h4>
<p>Yahoo provides its own yahoo messenger for Linux and it is similar
to the windows version except that you may find some features missing.
To get more details go to <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">yahoo</a>. </p>
<p>Since it is similar to the windows version you will find <tt>`Add
Friends, Your Status, Ban'</tt> etc buttons in their usual places,
generally as part of a menu at the top of Yahoo Messenger. Currently you
can send files, invite people to group chat, and get email
notifications. <br>
</p>
<h4><a name="ss1.4.3"></a> 1.4.3 AIM</h4>
<p><a href="http://kitclient.sourceforge.net">Kit</a> is the AIM client
for Linux (KDE). You will find it in the main menu under network /
internet or just type <tt>`kit'</tt> in a terminal. At the first startup
it will ask you to create a profile and if you do not have a account in
AOL it will ask you to create one by going to their site. The current
version of Netscape also has a built-in AIM client.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="ss1.5"></a> 1.5 All-In-One IM Clients</h3>
<h4><a name="ss1.5.1"></a> 1.5.1 Everybuddy</h4>
<p>Do you use or need several different instant messaging clients?
Everybuddy is an Open Source IM client that supports AIM, ICQ, MSN,
Yahoo!, and Jabber chat, as well as having some file transfer
capabilities. In other words, a single Everybuddy client can take the
place of several single-purpose clients. It is included (and often
installed by default) with some distros, or you can download it from
the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/everybuddy/">Everybuddy
homepage</a>.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="ss1.5.2"></a> 1.5.2 GAIM</h4>
<p>GAIM is another all-in-one client resembling AIM that works with
AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo! and more. If you don't have it already installed,
check out your installation CDs or go to the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gaim/">GAIM website</a>. </p>
