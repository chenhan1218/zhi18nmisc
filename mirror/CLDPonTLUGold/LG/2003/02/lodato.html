讓 Linux 更加有趣呦！</p>

<h2>內容</h2>

<p> Let's look at Linux-based voice recognition software from the
perspective of China. It would behoove Linux computer makers anyway to
begin manufacturing their computers in China, because China offers a
low-cost method of manufacturing and provides them with a large market
for their hardware which can also be exported to other important
markets around the world. </p>
<p> Linux  computers have the capacity to accommodate voice recognition
systems, such as IBM ViaVoice.  This is especially advantageous to
Chinese speakers because both Mandarin and Cantonese are very complex
in the written form, so documents could be more easily produced through
voice recognition software running on a Linux platform.  Using a
keyboard is next to impossible for Chinese languages because so many
characters are involved in typing a document. </p>
<p> Other languages will also benefit from using voice recognition
software for purposes of speed.  Hands-busy, eyes-busy professionals
can benefit greatly from voice recognition so they don't have to use a
mouse and keyboard to document their findings.  Voice-activated,
easily-used telephone systems will benefit all walks of life.  Anyone
driving a car will find voice recognition a much more effective way of
manipulating a vehicle and communicating from the vehicle. </p>
<p> The health-care market alone may justify the Linux based voice
recognition project. Health-care services are the largest expense of the
Group of Ten nations, and it is the fastest growing sector as well.
Health-care workers would benefit from using their voices to document
describing the treatments of patients.  Voice recognition allows them a
hands-free environment in which to analyze, treat and write about
particular cases easily and quickly. </p>
<p> Electronically connected medical devices via  wireless LAN can
benefit: </p>
<ul>
  <li> ...Hospital administration staff 	
    <ul>
      <li> Improve the usage efficiency of resources 	</li>
      <li> Achieve standardized, quality patient management 	</li>
      <li> Dramatically reduce data recording (transcription) errors 	</li>
      <li> Lower costs 	</li>
      <li> Make any room a telemetry room on demand (that is, do
laboratory measurements in any room regardless of where the central
equipment is located) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> ...Medical staff 	
    <ul>
      <li> Be empowered with a 24/7 complete set of vital-sign data 	</li>
      <li> Have more time for hands-on care 	</li>
      <li> See changes in patient status immediately to enable quicker
responses 	</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> In this life sciences field, the simplicity, reliability and low
cost of Linux for servers, tablets, embedded devices and desktops is
paramount. Only about 10% of the documents in the health-care field
in the USA are produced electronically due to the cumbersome and
unreliable nature of the Windows environment. 30% of the cost of
health-care is a direct result of manual creation of the documents and
many of the malpractice cases are also due to the imprecision of
transcriptions of manually scribbled medical records and directives,
as anybody who looks at a prescription can attest. </p>
<p> Obviously, the market for these new technologies exists. What
remains is for a hungry company with aggressive sales people to tap
into that market.  Once those sales people get the technology
distributed, the needs of many will be met and a new mass market will
open up that Microsoft isn't filling: assistive technology (AT). 
Actually, the field already exists but needs to be expanded to include
both physically disabled and functionally disabled. </p>
<p> Yes, voice recognition offers great promise for the future. 
However, it isn't perfect and needs to be improved.  One improvement
could use lip reading to bolster its accuracy.  Still another is
multi-tonal voice input. Another is directional microphones.  Every
generation of voice recognition software will improve as the hardware
for Linux gets bigger and stronger.</p>
