<h2>1.             Introduction </h2>
       </div>
           
<div>          
<p> Over the holidays I finally had a block of time large enough to work
on a network at home.  But getting started is always my biggest problem and
it took a while to understand what had to be done on which machine.  In retrospect
 it was quite easy to get started.  </p>
   
<p> This article is essentially little more than my notes, taken during the
 experience, less false starts.  To the best of my knowledge it documents
what I had to do and will be my reference if the need arises to repeat any
of this.  </p>
   
<p> To avoid inflating this unnecessarily and because I'm really just an
experienced newbie, almost nothing is explained.  There are references to
some relevant articles but I assume you know how to find the standard documentation.
  </p>
   
<p> To my mind there is no reason for anyone with two or more computers not
 to have them networked.  My first step was with an Ethernet card for the
PC, a cross-over cable, and a PCMCIA Ethernet card, all for 87.50 euro. 
Once that was working, another PCMCIA card (should have known by the price
that it was Windows-only), 8-port switch and 3 3-meter cables cost 67.50
euro.  Roughly $160 wasn't bad.  And it shouldn't cost much more than $25
to connect 2 PCs point-to-point.  </p>
   
<p> The current status of this home office network is as follows: <br>
  </p>
   
<ul>
    <li>Toshiba 486 500MB/24MB, SuSE 8.0 (kernel 2.4.18-4GB) without X</li>
    <li>  PC Pentium 166 2x4GB/32MB, SuSE 6.3 (kernel 2.2.13)</li>
    <li> Toshiba AMD 4GB/64MB, SuSE 8.0 (kernel 2.4.18-4GB) or Windows 98</li>
   
</ul>
      
<p> By the way, the asymmetry in the following is not due to anything inherent
 in networking or the different Linux kernels.  Rather, the 486 will one
day  be my portal to the Internet.  It shouldn't be able to do much of anything
 other than responding to someone it knows.  On the other hand the other
two  should have no restrictions.  </p>
     
<p> Other than that, be careful: this is merely intended to get up and running
 as quickly as possible.  Everything else has been pretty much ignored. 
Consider  this just a small but important first step. Your next step has
to be the relevant documentation because this is quite superficial!  </p>
        </div>
     
<div>          
<h2>2. Ethernet       </h2>
 </div>
           
<div>          
<p> Other than a PCMCIA problem (see below), installing and configuring Ethernet 
is rather straight-forward.  To keep things simple I started out with a cross-over 
cable, i.e. point-to-point, and moved on to a switch only after everything 
else was known to work.  </p>
 
<p> Rather than having each machine connect to the network at boot, there 
are scripts in /root to run when it is time to connect. Here are the relevant 
scripts and files from two of the machines (less comments and stuff not relevant 
here):  </p>
 
<p> Toshiba 486  </p>

<p> Pentium 166  </p>
 
<pre>     /etc/hosts:       127.0.0.1      localhost         PC<br>                       192.168.0.99   Toshiba486.Lohgo  Lohgo486<br>                       192.168.0.100  ToshibaAMD.Lohgo  LohgoAMD<br>                       192.168.0.101  PC.Lohgo          LohgoPC<br><br>     /etc/hosts.allow: sshd:      192.168.0.100<br>                       portmap:   192.168.0.100<br>                       lockd:     192.168.0.100<br>                       rquotad:   192.168.0.100<br>                       mountd:    192.168.0.100<br>                       statd:     192.168.0.100<br><br>     /root/eth-up:     #!/bin/bash<br>                       /sbin/insmod rtl8139<br>                       /sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.101 \<br>                                      broadcast 192.168.0.255 \<br>                                      netmask 255.255.255.0 up<br></pre>
    
<p> The following are the same on all 3 machines:  </p>
 
<pre>     /etc/hosts.deny:  ALL : ALL<br><br>     /root/eth-down:   #!/bin/bash<br>                       /sbin/ifconfig eth0 down<br><br>     /root/eth-stat:   #!/bin/bash<br>                       /sbin/ifconfig eth0; /bin/netstat -r<br></pre>
    
<p> The extra entries for the P166 in /etc/hosts.allow are to support nfs. 
 And insmod in /root/eth-up is due to the Ethernet card in the PC vs PCMCIA 
on the notebooks.  </p>
 
<p> Be aware that SuSE at installation has an option to "re-organize" /etc/hosts 
that defaults to CHECK_ETC_HOSTS=yes in /etc/rc.config. My suspicion is that 
this is what can cause the 192-IP-address to be replaced by a 127-address 
for the host itself in /etc/hosts on reboot.  I don't reboot often enough 
to feel like checking this out.  But if you get an inexplicable inability 
to access the network, do verify the contents of this file.  </p>
       </div>
     
<div>          
<h2>3. Ssh </h2>
       </div>
           
<div>          
<p> Without a doubt this is the most complex of the Linux facilities described 
here but is the key to a couple of things that are extremely useful and it 
certainly should be set up, for both convenience and security.  </p>
 
<p> Prerequisites/definitions: </p>
 <li><br>
 </li>
 <li> "local" is the machine whose keyboard you want to use </li>
 <li> "remote" is the machine whose keyboard you don't want to use </li>
 <li> "&lt;user&gt;" has been set up on both machines </li>
 <li> "&lt;host&gt;" is the 3rd column of the entry for the "remote" host
  in /etc/hosts on the "local" machine </li>
 <li> the entries in /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny on the   "remote" 
machine permit use of sshd from the "local" machine </li>
 <li> use of the mount command does mean playing disk-jockey between   the 
two machines as appropriate. </li>
 <li> the following is based on SuSE 6.3 (2.2.13) and 8.0 (2.4.18-4GB)   
 
  <p> This is what you have to do if you don't bother to set ssh up:  </p>
   
  <pre>Remote        Local          Comment<br><br>              &lt;logon as user also known to remote host&gt;<br>              ssh &lt;host&gt;<br>                             warning:... SOMETHING NASTY<br>              yes            accept it<br>              &lt;password&gt;<br></pre>
      
  <p> This is setup:  </p>
   
  <pre>Remote        Local          Comment<br><br>              &amp;ltl;ogon as user also known to remote host&gt;<br>              /usr/bin/ssh-keygen<br>                             accept default: .ssh/identity<br>                             no passphrase<br>              mount /floppy<br>              cp .ssh/identity.pub /floppy/<br>              umount /floppy<br><br>logon as &lt;the same user&gt;<br>mkdir .ssh                   if necessary<br>mount /floppy<br>cp /floppy/identity.pub .ssh/authorized_keys<br>cp /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub /floppy/known_hosts<br>umount /floppy<br><br>              mount /floppy<br>              cp /floppy/known_hosts .ssh/<br>              umount /floppy<br>              vi .ssh/known_hosts<br>                             add &lt;host&gt; at start of line and<br>                             remove root@&lt;host&gt; at end<br></pre>
      
  <p> And this is what you have to do to logon after setting things up: 
  </p>
   
  <pre>Remote        Local          Comment<br><br>              &lt;logon as user also known to remote host&gt;<br>              ssh &lt;host&gt;<br></pre>
      
  <p> Note that the host key is generated as part of system installation
(with SuSE anyhow).  And there can be differences in directory structure
(SuSE's kernel 2.2 didn't have 'ssh' under 'etc'). Also note that this is
just intended to get someone unfamiliar with ssh up and running.  Do not
blindly follow these steps if you have used ssh before!  In particular most
'cp's certainly ought to be 'cat ... &gt;&gt;'.  In the office at home I
don't want a passphrase  to begin work on a different machine, but you might.
 </p>

<div>          
<h2>4. Screen       </h2>
 </div>
           
<div>          
<p> Although it has been mentioned in Linux Gazette several times and I actually 
did play with it briefly, the need for screen wasn't at all obvious to me. 
 Given 6+ vt's and X running on at least two others with unlimited windows 
under whatever window manager one has running, it seemed just another level 
of complexity.  </p>
 
<p> The need became obvious as the network at home began taking shape. The 
rationale behind screen boils down to this: if you start sessions on remote 
machines under screen, they remain available to you as long as the remote 
machine isn't shut down -- independent of what happens on the communication 
link or your local machine. Like one of my PCMCIA Ethernet cards only works 
under Windows and I can thus only connect one of the notebooks to the PC at
a time, if the AMD is also running Linux, as it usually is -- but no need
 to shut the 486 down, just eject the card, pop it into the AMD and screen 
keeps sessions active on the 486 for later access.  </p>
 
<p> To start screen:  </p>
 
<pre>    screen -R   restart session if available, otherwise start one<br></pre>
    
<p> Within screen (not at all apparent, it hides well) use Ctrl-a followed 
by:  </p>
 
<pre>    ?   help<br>    w   show list of windows<br>    n   switch to next window<br>    c   create new window<br>    d   disconnect<br>    A   assign title to window<br></pre>
       </div>
     
<div>          
<h2>5. File Transfer       </h2>
 </div>
           
<div>          
<p> If you are using ssh, you can get rid of rsh -- and telnet and ftp as 
well for that matter.  Here are a couple of alternatives that to me are more 
convenient than the lot.  </p>
 
<p> Netcat is a nifty little tool, analogous to cat.  You start it to receive 
a file on one machine  </p>
 
<pre>    netcat -vv -l -p &lt;port&gt; &gt; &lt;file&gt;<br></pre>
    
<p> and then tell the other machine what to send  </p>
 
<pre>    netcat -vv -w 10 &lt;hpopst&gt; &lt;port&gt; &lt; &lt;file&gt;<br>or<br>    tar -czvf - &lt;directory&gt; | netcat -vv -w 10 &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;<br></pre>
    
<p> Use netstat and /etc/services to find an available port.  The option "-w
10" tells the sender to terminate the connection after 10 seconds of inactivity
and the option "-vv" lets you verify that the correct number of bytes was
sent and received.  </p>
 
<p> While netcat holds promise for scripts to backup to a different machine 
as the network at home gradually takes shape, Midnight Commander has amazing 
facilities for the things one simply has to do by hand.  </p>
 
<p> If ssh has been set up properly, the following entered in the command 
line makes mc's active panel point to the same user on the "other" machine 
-- yes, "#sh" not "#ssh", unfortunately  </p>
 
<pre>    cd /#sh:&lt;host&gt;<br></pre>
    
<p> And if the other side has anonymous ftp running, the following should 
be fairly self-explanatory  </p>
 
<pre>    cd /#ftp:www.tldp.org/<br></pre>
       </div>
     
<div>          
<h2>6. NFS </h2>
       </div>
           
<div>          
<p> I played around with nfs and it works but unfortunately my notes are non-existant
(basically just check-marks in the printout of the HOWTO).  As I recall,
besides installing the relevant package on client and server all that was
needed was to edit /etc/exports on the PC (server) as follows:   </p>
 
<pre>/home	192.168.0.100(rw,root_squash,sync,insecure)<br>/tmp	192.168.0.100(rw,root_squash,sync,insecure)<br></pre>
   See also /etc/hosts.allow under 1. Ethernet, above.   
<p> At installation SuSE has a number of options to be selected, many (all?) 
of which wind up in /etc/rc.config.  Here is an excerpt of those relevant 
to nfs:  </p>
 
<pre>START_PORTMAP="yes"<br>NFS_SERVER="yes"<br>USE_KERNEL_NFSD="yes"<br>USE_KERNEL_NFSD_NUMBER="4"<br>NFS_SERVER_UGID="no"<br>REEXPORT_NFS="no"<br></pre>
    
<p> On the AMD (client) I added the following to /etc/fstab:  </p>
 
<pre>192.168.0.101:/home	/Rhome	nfs	noauto,users,sync 0 0<br>192.168.0.101:/tmp	/Rtmp	nfs	noauto,users,sync 0 0<br></pre>
    
<p> At that point the mount command works with /Rhome etc. just as well as 
/floppy or any other entry in fstab.  One minor annoyance is that user ID's 
must be the same on all machines using nfs. This was not a problem for me 
because, when installing Linux, I create the few users in the same order.
  </p>
       </div>
     
<div>          
<h2>7. Samba</h2>
       </div>
           
<div>          
<p> Given the difficulty of keeping track of what one is doing under Windows, 
particularly with false starts and things that turn out to be wrong or simply 
irrelevant, this needs to be taken with a large grain of salt.  It assumes 
that the driver for the PCMCIA card has been installed, if relevant.  And 
if the terminology is slightly obscure, that is due to my translating from 
the German versions of Windows.  </p>
 
<p> The following is what was necessary to enable logon to the PC from the 
AMD under Samba, i.e. from Windows 98 to Linux 2.2.13 (SuSE 6.3).  With appropriate 
adjustments the same steps worked in the other direction, i.e. from Windows 
95 to Linux 2.4.18-4GB (SuSE 8.0).  But note these differences: </p>

  <p> At this point after booting, Windows will ask you to logon, which you 
can either do with a user known to Samba or cancel to use Windows without 
the network as before.  Now, however, the pop-up window opened by Ctrl-Esc 
includes near the bottom a line to logoff that afterwards provides the same 
logon prompt as booting. And the entries in the task bar -- in the home directory, 
anyhow -- tell you who and where you are, as in  </p>
   
  <p> "Explorer - &lt;user&gt; at &lt;host&gt;"  </p>
   
  <p> where "&lt;host&gt;" is the 3rd column of the entry for the Linux machine 
in /etc/hosts on the Linux machine.  </p>
   
  <p> Symbolic links work quite nicely.  The following executed within the 
home directory of some user makes a directory -- even on a different partition 
-- on the Linux machine available to that user on the Windows machine:  </p>
   
  <p> ln -s /dos/f/pictures pictures  </p>
   
  <p> Due to a shortage of resources on the PC and the fact that I have no 
real use for Windows anyhow, I use the following scripts to start and stop 
the Samba daemons on the PC as needed:  </p>
   
  <pre>/root/samba-up:     #!/bin/bash<br>                    /usr/sbin/smbd    -d3    -l /tmp/sbd.log<br>                    /usr/sbin/nmbd -D -d0 -o -l /tmp/sbd.log<br><br>/root/samba-down:   #!/bin/bash<br>                    kill -s SIGTERM $(ps aux | grep mbd \<br>                        | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')<br></pre>
   
  <p>  Once you have this working, it won't take you 5 minutes to set up
a network printer.  Uncomment (or add) the following to smb.conf:  </p>
   
  <pre>[printers]<br>   comment = All Printers<br>   browseable = no<br>   printable = yes<br>   public = no<br>   read only = yes<br>   create mode = 0700<br>   directory = /tmp<br></pre>
   
  <p>  And then spend some time with the archaic data entry system on the
 Windows machine:  </p>
   
  <pre>control panel | printer | new printer<br>  network printer | search<br>    network environment | Pc<br>      hpdj-a4-raw<br>    manufacturer: HP<br>    printer:      HP OfficeJet<br></pre>
   
  <p>  Shut down and re-start Samba and you're in business.        </p>

<h2>8. PCMCIA  </h2>
       </div>
           
<div>          
<p> To be honest I have no idea whether this is generally applicable or is
specific to SuSE (8.0).  And it was only the 2.4 kernel that had problems
with PCMCIA, not 2.2 strangely enough.  Also, it has nothing to do with networking
per se.  But if you're going to connect a notebook to your network, you'll
probably have to confront the alphabet monster.  And a PCMCIA Ethernet card
makes a delightful docking station.  </p>
<p> Omitting many details, I initially failed to note an inconsistency with
references to irq 5 and 10 that later led to tons of error messages.  But
this was due to having inserted the PCMCIA card before starting the installation
of Linux.  </p>
<p> In my case at least, by not inserting the PCMCIA card before starting
installation, there was a reference to only one irq which led to my doing
the following.  </p>
<p> After initial boot in /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia add </p>
<pre>	PCMCIA_PCIC="i82365"<br>	PCMCIA_PCIC_OPTS="irq_list=10"<br></pre>
<p> and then run /sbin/SuSEconfig and reboot.  </p>
<p> However, installing the PCMCIA software before doing this causes the
notebook to hang irrevocably on boot.  The only way to boot is by giving
LILO the parameter NOPCMCIA=yes.  Instead, I installed the PCMCIA software
after SuSEconfig and before reboot.  </p>
<p> After that, inserting the PCMCIA card produces a couple of beeps and
it works as advertised.  Since this is my first personal experience with
Ethernet, I can't comment on alternatives but the D-Link DFE-650TXD PCMCIA
Ethernet card works well, Linux-to-Linux anyhow (a couple of hours sending
stuff over the network before risking the wretched "Recovery CD-Rom" to make
Windows 98 work again) and has lots of LEDs to let you know what is going
on.  </p>
<p> Here is the output from /sbin/cardctl config and ident.  </p>

<h2>10. A Future without Windows?   </h2>
       </div>
           
<div>          
<p> Coming from pre-TRS-80 days, I've used DOS, various versions of Windows,
at least 3 releases of OS/2, Coherent, and now 5 releases of SuSE Linux over
at least 5 years.  I am convinced that anyone in a position to "compare and
contrast" would agree that at best Windows is unstable junk.  One of my goals
for a quite some time had been to gain complete independence from Windows. 
 </p>
<p> But consider: our ISDN phone system has an RS-232 connector with which
it can be programmed via -- yeah, you got it.  One of the printers is USB
for the notebook and guess whose drivers are available.  Our digital camera
uses smart media and the USB smart media reader...  Oh, well, you get the
picture.  </p>
<p> I've only had Samba working for a week and actually hadn't even intended
to check it out but everything else worked so well that it seemed worth a
try.  And it's so slick that I question whether it would really be worth
my effort to try to find replacement drivers for this legacy stuff.  How
many hours, how many experiments, what guarantee of success?  Doesn't it
make more sense to boot the notebook under the "silly system" (I hope Monty
Python put that under GPL) and use the Samba connection to the rest of the
network? At least until the last Windows-legacy device eats it.       </p>
