<div>
<h2>1. 前言</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> The Simputer is a StrongArm CPU based handheld device running Linux.
Originally developed by professors at the Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore, the device has a social objective of bringing computing and
connectivity within the reach of rural communities. This articles
provides a tutorial introduction to programming the Simputer (and
similar ARM based handheld devices - there are lots of them in the
market). The reader is expected to have some experience programming on
Linux. Disclaimer: I try to describe things which I had done on my
Simputer without any problem - if following my instructions leads to
your handheld going up in smoke - I should not be held responsible! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>2. Hardware/Software</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> The device is powered by an Intel StrongArm (SA-1110) CPU. The flash
memory size is either 32Mb or 16Mb and RAM is 64Mb or 32Mb. The
peripheral features include: </p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li> USB master as well as slave ports. </li>
  <li> Standard serial port. </li>
  <li> Infra Red communication port. </li>
  <li> Smart card reader </li>
</ol>
<p> Some of these features are enabled by using a `docking cradle'
provided with the base unit. Power can be provided either by
rechargeable batteries or external AC mains. </p>
<p> Simputer is powered by GNU/Linux - kernel version 2.4.18 (with a few
patches) works fine. The unit comes bundled with binaries for the
X-Window system and a few simple utility programs. More details can be
obtained from the project home page at <a href="http://www.simputer.org">www.simputer.org</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>3. Powering up</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> There is nothing much to it, other than pressing the `power button'.
You will see a small tux picture coming up and within a few seconds, you
will have X up and running . The LCD screen is touch sensitive and you
can use a small `stylus' (geeks use finger nails!) to select
applications and move through the graphical interface. If you want to
have keyboard input, be prepared for some agonizing manipulations using
the stylus and a `soft keyboard' which is nothing but a GUI program from
which you can select single alphabets and other symbols.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>4. Waiting for bash</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> GUI's are for kids. You are not satisfied till you see the trusted
old bash prompt. Well, you don't have to try a lot. The Simputer has a
serial port - attach the provided serial cable to it - the other end
goes to a free port on your host Linux PC (in my case, /dev/ttyS1). Now
fire up a communication program (I use `minicom') - you have to first
configure the program so that it uses /dev/ttyS1 with communication
speed set to 115200 (that's what the Simputer manual says - if you are
using a similar handheld, this need not be the same) and 8N1 format,
hardware and software flow controls disabled. Doing this with minicom is
very simple - invoke it as: </p>
<p> minicom -m -s </p>
<p> Once configuration is over - just type: </p>
<p> minicom -m </p>
<p> and be ready for the surprise. You will immediately see a login
prompt. You should be able to type in a user name/password and log on.
You should be able to run simple commands like `ls', `ps' etc - you may
even be able to use `vi' . </p>
<p> If you are not familiar with running communication programs on
Linux, you may be wondering what really happened. Nothing much - it's
standard Unix magic. A program sits on the Simputer watching the serial
port (the Simputer serial port, called ttySA0) - when you run minicom on
the Linux PC, you establish a connection with that program, which sends
you a login prompt over the line, reads in your response, authenticates
you and spawns a shell with which you can interact over the line. </p>
<p> Once minicom initializes the serial port on the PC end, you can
`script' your interactions with the Simputer. You are exploiting the
idea that the program running on the Simputer is watching for data over
the serial line - the program does not care whether the data comes from
minicom itself or a script. You can try out the following experiment: </p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li> Open two consoles (on the Linux PC) </li>
  <li> Run minicom on one console, log on to the simputer </li>
  <li> On the other console, type `echo ls &gt; /dev/ttyS1' </li>
  <li> Come to the first console - you will see that the command   `ls'
has executed on the Simputer. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h2>5. Setting up USB Networking</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> The Simputer comes with a USB slave port. You can establish a TCP/IP
link between your Linux PC and the Simputer via this USB interface. Here
are the steps you should take: </p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li> Make sure you have a recent Linux distribution - Red Hat   7.3 is
good enough. </li>
  <li> Plug one end of the USB cable onto the USB slave slot in   the
Simputer, then boot the Simputer. </li>
  <li> Boot your Linux PC. DO NOT connect the other end of the   USB
cable to your PC now. Log in as root on the PC. </li>
  <li> Run the command `insmod usbnet' to load a kernel module   which
enables USB networking on the Linux PC. Verify that   the module has
been loaded by running `lsmod'. </li>
  <li> Now plug the other end of the USB cable onto a free USB   slot of
the Linux PC. The USB subsystem in the Linux kernel   should be able to
register a device attach. On my Linux   PC, immediately after plugging
in the USB cable, I get   the following kernel messages (which can be
seen by running   the command `dmesg'): </li>
</ol>
<pre>usb.c: registered new driver usbnet<br>hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/1, assigned device<br>number 3<br>usb.c: ignoring set_interface for dev 3, iface 0, alt 0<br>usb0: register usbnet 001/003, Linux Device<br></pre>
<p> After you have reached this far, you have to run a few more
commands: </p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li> Run `ifconfig usb0 192.9.200.1' - this will assign an IP
address to the USB interface on the Linux PC. </li>
  <li> Using `minicom' and the supplied serial cable, log on to   the
Simputer as root. Then run the command `ifconfig usbf   192.9.200.2' on
the Simputer. </li>
  <li> Try `ping 192.9.200.2' on the Linux PC. If you see ping   packets
running to and fro, congrats. You have successfully   set up a TCP/IP
link! </li>
</ol>
<p> You can now telnet/ftp to the Simputer through this TCP/IP link.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>6. Hello, Simputer</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> It's now time to start real work. Your C compiler (gcc) normally
generates `native' code, ie, code which runs on the microprocessor on
which gcc itself runs - most often, an Intel (or clone) CPU. If you wish
your program to run on the Simputer (which is based on the StrongArm
microprocessor), the machine code generated by gcc should be
understandable to the StrongArm CPU - your `gcc' should be a cross
compiler. If you download the gcc source code (preferably 2.95.2)
together with `binutils', you should be able to configure and compile it
in such a way that you get a cross compiler (which could be invoked
like, say, arm-linux-gcc). This might be a bit tricky if you are doing
it for the first time - your handheld vendor should supply you with a CD
which contains the required tools in a precompiled form - it is
recommended that you use it (but if you are seriously into embedded
development, you should try downloading the tools and building them
yourselves). </p>
<p> Assuming that you have arm-linux-gcc up and running, you can write a
simple `Hello, Simputer' program, compile it into an `a.out', ftp it
onto the Simputer and execute it (it would be good to have one console
on your Linux PC running ftp and another one running telnet - as soon as
you compile the code, you can upload it and run it from the telnet
console - note that you may have to give execute permission to the ftp'd
code by doing `chmod u+x a.out' on the Simputer). </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>7. A note on the Arm Linux kernel</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> The Linux kernel is highly portable - all machine dependencies are
isolated in directories under the `arch' subdirectory (which is directly
under the root of the kernel source tree, say, /usr/src/linux). You
will find a directory called `arm' under `arch'. It is this directory
which contains ARM CPU specific code for the Linux kernel. </p>
<p> The Linux ARM port was initiated by Russell King. The ARM
architecture is very popular in the embedded world and there are a LOT
of different machines with fantastic names like Itsy, Assabet, Lart,
Shannon etc all of which use the StrongArm CPU (there also seem to be
other kinds of ARM CPU's - now that makes up a really heady mix). There
are minor differences in the architecture of these machines which makes
it necessary to perform `machine specific tweaks' to get the kernel
working on each one of them. The tweaks for most machines are available
in the standard kernel itself, and you only have to choose the actual
machine type during the kernel configuration phase to get everything in
order. But to make things a bit confusing with the Simputer, it seems
that the tweaks for the initial Simputer specification have got into the
ARM kernel code - but the vendors who are actually manufacturing and
marketing the device seem to be building according to a modified
specification - and the patches required for making the ARM kernel run
on these modified configurations is not yet integrated into the main
kernel tree. But that is not really a problem, because your vendor will
supply you with the patches - and they might soon get into the official
kernel. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>8. Getting and building the kernel source</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> You can download the 2.4.18 kernel source from the nearest Linux
kernel ftp mirror. You will need the file `patch-2.4.18-rmk4' (which can
be obtained from the ARM Linux FTP site ftp.arm.linux.org.uk). You
might also need a vendor supplied patch, say,
`patch-2.4.18-rmk4-vendorstring'. Assume that all these files are copied
to the /usr/local/src directory. </p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li> First, untar the main kernel distribution by running `tar   xvfz
kernel-2.4.18.tar.gz' </li>
  <li> You will get a directory called `linux'. Change over to   that
directory and run `patch -p1 &lt; ../patch-2.4.18-rmk4'. </li>
  <li> Now apply the vendor supplied patch. Run `patch -p1  &lt;
../patch-2.4.18-rmk4-vendorstring'. </li>
</ol>
<p> Now, your kernel is ready to be configured and built. Before that,
you have to examine the top level Makefile (under /usr/local/src/linux)
and make two changes - there will be a line of the form: </p>
<p> ARCH := &lt;lots-of-stuff&gt; </p>
<p> near the top. Change it to </p>
<p> ARCH := arm </p>
<p> You need to make one more change. You observe that the Makefile
defines: </p>
<p> </p>
<pre>AS = ($CROSS_COMPILE)as<br>LD = ($CROSS_COMPILE)ld<br>CC = ($CROSS_COMPILE)gcc<br></pre>
<p> You note that the symbol CROSS_COMPILE is equated with the empty
string. During normal compilation, this will result in AS getting
defined to `as', CC getting defined to `gcc' and so on which is what we
want. But when we are cross compiling, we use arm-linux-gcc,
arm-linux-ld, arm-linux-as etc. So you have to equate CROSS_COMPILE with
the string arm-linux-, ie, in the Makefile, you have to enter: </p>
<p> CROSS_COMPILE = arm-linux- </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Once these changes are incorporated into the Makefile, you can start
configuring the kernel by running `make menuconfig' (note that it is
possible to do without modifying the Makefile. You run `make menuconfig
ARCH=arm'). It may take a bit of tweaking here and there before you can
actually build the kernel without error. You will not need to modify
most things - the defaults should be acceptable. </p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li> You have to set the system type to SA1100 based ARM system   and
then choose the SA11x0 implementation to be `Simputer(Clr)'   (or
something else, depending on your machine). I had   also enabled SA1100
USB function support, SA11x0 USB net   link support and SA11x0 USB char
device emulation. </li>
  <li> Under Character devices-&gt;Serial drivers, I enabled SA1100
serial port support, console on serial port support and   set the
default baud rate to 115200 (you may need to set   differently for your
machine). </li>
  <li> Under Character devices, SA1100 real time clock and Simputer
real time clock are enabled. </li>
  <li> Under Console drivers, VGA Text console is disabled. </li>
  <li> Under General Setup, the default kernel command string   is set
to `root=/dev/mtdblock2 quite'. This may be different   for your
machine. </li>
</ol>
<p> Once the configuration process is over, you can run </p>
<p> make zImage </p>
<p> and in a few minutes, you should get a file called `zImage' under
arch/arm/boot. This is your new kernel. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>9. Running the new kernel</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> I describe the easiest way to get the new kernel up and running. </p>
<p> Just like you have LILO or Grub acting as the boot loader for your
Linux PC, the handheld too will be having a bootloader stored in its
non volatile memory. In the case of the Simputer, this bootloader is
called `blob' (which I assume is the boot loader developed for the
Linux Advanced Radio Terminal Project, `Lart'). As soon as you power on
the machine, the boot loader starts running - If you start minicom on
your Linux PC, keep the `enter' key pressed and then power on the
device, the bootloader, instead of continuing with booting the kernel
stored in the device's flash memory, will start interacting with you
through a prompt which looks like this: </p>
<p> blob&gt; </p>
<p> At the bootloader prompt, you can type: </p>
<p> blob&gt; download kernel </p>
<p> which results in blob waiting for you to send a uuencoded kernel
image through the serial port. Now, on the Linux PC, you should run the
command: </p>
<p> uuencode zImage /dev/stdout &gt; /dev/ttyS1 </p>
<p> This will send out a uuencoded kernel image through the COM port -
which will be read and stored by the bootloader in the device's RAM.
Once this process is over, you get back the boot loader prompt. You
just have to type: </p>
<p> blob&gt; boot </p>
<p> and the boot loader will run the kernel which you have right now
compiled and downloaded. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>10. A bit of kernel hacking</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> What good is a cool new device if you can't do a bit of kernel
hacking? My next step after compiling and running a new kernel was to
check out how to compile and run kernel modules. Here is a simple
program called `a.c': </p>
<p> </p>
<pre>#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;<br><br>/* Just a simple module */<br><br>int <br>init_module(void) <br>{ <br>   printk("loading module...\n");<br>   return 0;<br>}<br><br>void <br>cleanup_module(void) <br>{ <br>   printk("cleaning up ...\n");<br>}<br></pre>
<p> You have to compile it using the command line: </p>
<p> arm-linux-gcc -c -O -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ a.c 
-I/usr/local/src/linux-2.4.18/include </p>
<p> You can ftp the resulting `a.o' onto the Simputer and load it into
the kernel by running: </p>
<p> insmod ./a.o </p>
<p> You can remove the module by running: </p>
<p> rmmod a </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>11. Handling Interrupts</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> After running the above program, I started scanning the kernel
source to identify the simplest code segment which would demonstrate
some kind of physical hardware access - and I found it in the hard key
driver. The Simputer has small buttons which when pressed act as the
arrow keys - these buttons seem to be wired onto the general purpose
I/O pins of the ARM CPU (which can also be configured to act as
interrupt sources - if my memory of reading the StrongArm manual is
correct). Writing a kernel module which responds when these keys are
pressed is a very simple thing - here is a small program which is just
a modified and trimmed down version of the hardkey driver - you press
the button corresponding to the right arrow key - an interrupt gets
generated which results in the handler getting executed. Our handler
simply prints a message and does nothing else. Before inserting the
module, we must make sure that the kernel running on the device does
not incorporate the default button driver code - checking
/proc/interrupts would be sufficient. </p>
<p> Compile the program shown below into an object file (just as we did
in the previous program), load it using `insmod', check
/proc/interrupts to verify that the interrupt line has been acquired.
Pressing the button should result in the handler getting called - the
interrupt count displayed in /proc/interrupts should also change. </p>
<pre>#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;linux/ioport.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;linux/sched.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;asm-arm/irq.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;asm/io.h&gt;<br><br>static void <br>key_handler(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs)<br>{<br>  printk("IRQ %d called\n", irq);<br>}<br><br>static int  <br>init_module(void)<br>{<br>  unsigned int res = 0;<br>  printk("Hai, Key getting ready\n");<br>  set_GPIO_IRQ_edge(GPIO_GPIO12, GPIO_FALLING_EDGE);<br>  res = request_irq(IRQ_GPIO12, key_handler, SA_INTERRUPT,<br>  "Right Arrow Key", NULL);<br>  if(res) {<br>     printk("Could Not Register irq %d\n", IRQ_GPIO12);<br>     return res;<br>   }<br>  return res ;<br>}<br><br>static void <br>cleanup_module(void)<br>{<br>  printk("cleanup called\n");<br>  free_irq(IRQ_GPIO12, NULL);<br>}<br></pre>
</div>
<div>
<h2>12. Future work</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> A Linux based handheld offers a lot of opportunities for serious fun
- as I learn more about the device, I shall try to share my findings
with the readers.</p>
