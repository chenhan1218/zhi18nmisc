  <div> 
	<p>The basic features of ptrace were explained in <a href="../issue81/sandeep.html">Part 
	  I</a>. In <a href="../issue83/sandeep.html">Part II</a> we saw a small program 
	  which accessed the registers of a process and modified them so as to change 
	  the output of that process, by injecting some extra code. This time we are 
	  going to access the memory of a process. The purpose of this article is 
	  to introduce a methods for infecting binaries on runtime. There are many 
	  possible areas of use for this technique. </p>

  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss1" id="ss1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>We are familiar with ptrace and know the techniques of attaching a process, 
	  how to trace it and finally to free it. We also have an idea about the structure 
	  of the Linux binary format - ELF.</p>
	<p>Our plan is to fetch/modify a running binary. So we have to locate the 
	  symbols inside the binary. There we need <code>link_map</code>. link_map 
	  is the dynamic linker's internal structure with which it keeps track of 
	  loaded libraries and symbols within libraries. </p>
	<p>The foramt of link_map is (from /usr/include/link.h) </p>
	<code> </code> 
	<pre class="sample">
struct link_map
  {
    ElfW(Addr) l_addr;      /* Base address shared object is loaded at.  */
    char *l_name;           /* Absolute file name object was found in.  */
    ElfW(Dyn) *l_ld;        /* Dynamic section of the shared object.  */
    struct link_map *l_next, *l_prev; /* Chain of loaded objects.  */
  };
</pre>
	<code> </code> 
	<p>A small explanation for the fields. </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>l_addr: Base address where shared object is loaded. This value can also 
		be found from /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</li>
	  <li>l_name: pointer to library name in string table</li>
	  <li>l_ld : pointer to dynamic (DT_*) sections of shared lib</li>
	  <li>l_next: pointer to next link_map node</li>
	  <li>l_prev: pointer to previous link_map node</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Link-map is a linked list, each item on list having a pointer to loaded 
	  library. What we have to do is, to follow this chain, go through every library 
	  and find our symbol. Now we have a question. Where we can find this link_map? 
	</p>
	<p>For every object file, there is a global offset table (GOT) which contains 
	  many details of the binary. In GOT, the second entry is dedicated for the 
	  link_map. So we get the address of link_map from <b>GOT[1]</b> and we go 
	  on searching our symbol. </p>
    </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss2" id="ss2"></a>2. Straight to code</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Now we have collected the basic information needed to access the memory. 
	  Let's start now. First of all we attach the process 'pid' for tracing. Now 
	  we go for finding out the link_map we require. You will find functions <code>read_data</code>, 
	  <code>read_str</code> etc. These are helper functions to make working with 
	  ptrace easier. Helper functions are self explaining. </p>
	<p>The function for locating the link_map is: </p>
	<code> </code> 
	<pre class="sample">
struct link_map *locate_linkmap(int pid)
{
    Elf32_Ehdr *ehdr = malloc(sizeof(Elf32_Ehdr));
    Elf32_Phdr *phdr = malloc(sizeof(Elf32_Phdr));
    Elf32_Dyn *dyn = malloc(sizeof(Elf32_Dyn));
    Elf32_Word got;
    struct link_map *l = malloc(sizeof(struct link_map));
    unsigned long phdr_addr, dyn_addr, map_addr;
    
     read_data(pid, 0x08048000, ehdr, sizeof(Elf32_Ehdr));
    phdr_addr = 0x08048000 + ehdr-&gt;e_phoff;
    printf("program header at %p\n", phdr_addr);
    read_data(pid, phdr_addr, phdr, sizeof(Elf32_Phdr));

    while (phdr-&gt;p_type != PT_DYNAMIC) {
        read_data(pid, phdr_addr += sizeof(Elf32_Phdr), phdr,
                             sizeof(Elf32_Phdr));
    }
    
    read_data(pid, phdr-&gt;p_vaddr, dyn, sizeof(Elf32_Dyn));
    dyn_addr = phdr-&gt;p_vaddr;

    while (dyn-&gt;d_tag != DT_PLTGOT) {
        read_data(pid, dyn_addr += sizeof(Elf32_Dyn), dyn, sizeof(Elf32_Dyn));
    }

    got = (Elf32_Word) dyn-&gt;d_un.d_ptr;
    got += 4;           /* second GOT entry, remember? */

    read_data(pid, (unsigned long) got, &amp;map_addr, 4);
    read_data(pid, map_addr, l, sizeof(struct link_map));
    free(phdr);
    free(ehdr);
    free(dyn);
    return l;
}
</pre>
	<code> </code>
    <p> We start from the location 0x08048000 to get elf header of the process 
	  we are tracing. We get the elf header and from its fields we can get the 
	  program header. (The fields of headers were discussed in <a href="../issue83/sandeep.html">Part 
	  II</a>.) Once we get the program header, we go on checking for the header 
	  with dynamic linking information. From the header/struct with dynamic linking 
	  information, we fetch the location of the information. Go on searching until 
	  we get the base address of global offset table. </p>
	<p>Now we have the address of GOT with us and take the second entry of GOT 
	  (there we have link_map). From there get the address of the link_map which 
	  we require and return. </p>
	<p>We have the struct link_map and we have to get symtab and strtab. For this, 
	  we move to <code>l_ld</code> field of link_map and traverse through dynamic 
	  sections until DT_SYMTAB and DT_STRTAB have been found, and finally we can 
	  seek our symbol from DT_SYMTAB. DT_SYMTAB and DT_STRTAB are the addresses 
	  of symbol table and string table respectively. </p>
	<p>The function resolv_tables is: </p>
	<code> </code> 
	<pre class="sample">
void resolv_tables(int pid, struct link_map *map)
{
    Elf32_Dyn *dyn = malloc(sizeof(Elf32_Dyn));
    unsigned long addr;
    addr = (unsigned long) map-&gt;l_ld;
    read_data(pid, addr, dyn, sizeof(Elf32_Dyn));
    while (dyn-&gt;d_tag) {
        switch (dyn-&gt;d_tag) {
        case DT_HASH:
            read_data(pid, dyn-&gt;d_un.d_ptr + map-&gt;l_addr + 4, 
                       &amp;nchains, sizeof(nchains));
            break;
        case DT_STRTAB:
            strtab = dyn-&gt;d_un.d_ptr;
            break;
        case DT_SYMTAB:
            symtab = dyn-&gt;d_un.d_ptr;
            break;
        default:
            break;
        }
        addr += sizeof(Elf32_Dyn);
        read_data(pid, addr, dyn, sizeof(Elf32_Dyn));
    }
    free(dyn);
}
</pre>
	<code> </code> 
	<p>What we actually do here is just reading dynamic sections one by one and 
	  checks whether the tag is DT_STRTAB or DT_SYMTAB. If yes, we can get their 
	  respective pointers and assign to <code>strtab</code> and <code>symtab</code>. 
	  Once the dynamic sectoins are over, we can stop. </p>
	<p>Our next step is getting the value of symbol from the symbol table. For 
	  this we take every symbol table entry one by one and check it whether it's 
	  a function name. (We are interested in finding the value of a library function). 
	  If it is then it's compared with the function name given by us. If here 
	  also they match now the value of the symbol is returned. </p>
	<p>Now we have got the value of the symbol what we actually required. What 
	  help will the value do for us? The answer depends upon the reader. As I 
	  have already stated we may use this for both good and evil purposes. </p>
	<p>You might be thinking that everything is over. We forgot a step that we 
	  shouldn't forget - detaching the traced process. This may leave the process 
	  in a stopped state for ever and the consequences are already discussed in 
	  <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue81/sandeep.html">Part I</a>. So 
	  our last and final step is to detach the traced process. </p>
	<p>The program may be obtained from. <a href="misc/sandeep/Ptrace.c.txt">Ptrace.c</a> 
	  Almost the whole code is self explaining. </p>
	<p>Compile it by typing </p>
	<code> </code> 
	<pre class="sample">
#cc Ptrace.c -o symtrace
</pre>
	<code> </code> 
	<p>Now we want to test the program. Run some process in some other console, 
	  come back and type. (Here my test program is <code>emacs</code> and the 
	  symbol I give is <code>strcpy</code>). You may trace any program that is 
	  traceable instead of emacs and any symbol you want to inspect. </p>
	<code> </code> 
	<pre class="sample">
#./symtrace `ps ax | grep 'emacs' | cut -f 2 -d " "` strcpy
</pre>
	<p><code> </code> and watch what is going on. </p>
	</div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss3" id="ss3"></a>3. Conclusion</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>So, we come to the end of a series of three articles which has gone through 
	  the basic programming with <code>ptrace</code>. Once you have understood 
	  the basic concept it is not difficult to make steps by your own. More details 
	  on ptrace and elf are available at <a href="http://www.phrack.org">www.phrack.org</a>. 
	  One more thing I have to write is that, we reached here without even mentioning 
	  a major topic. One major feature of ptrace is its play with system calls. 
	  In User Mode Linux, this feature is used in a large scale. I am busy with 
	  my classes and final year project, and I promise, if time permits we will 
	  continue this series and then we will have a look at those features of ptrace.
