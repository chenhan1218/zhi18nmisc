	<h2><a name="ss1" id="ss1"></a>1. Meet TUX - &quot;The Webserver&quot; </h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>If you did come to the site to read an article about Tux the Penguin -- 
	  the lucky mascot of Linux -- you might be disappointed. But don't go away 
	  just yet: read on to find what TUX the webserver can do do for you in terms 
	  of performance and you will be delighted. You might just discover something 
	  to hack on and tweak. This is an article about TUX - the webserver embedded 
	  within the Linux kernel. </p>
	<p align="justify"> The name TUX comes from 'Threaded linUX webserver'. TUX 
	  was written by Red Hat and is based on the 2.4 kernel series. It is a kernel-space 
	  HTTP subsystem. As you may have guessed by now TUX is released under the 
	  GNU GPL. So in the free software tradition, you are free to tweak it and 
	  modify it to meet your own specific needs. One of the ways of adapting TUX 
	  for our needs ,is by writing TUX modules, which can be user-space or kernel-space 
	  modules. The main goal behind writing TUX was to enable high-performance 
	  webserving on Linux. This was especially important as Linux is extremely 
	  popular in the webserver market. </p>
	<p align="justify"> TUX is not as feature-filled as Apache and has some limitations. 
	  But nevertheless, TUX is a complete HTTP/1.1 compliant webserver supporting 
	  HTTP/1.1 persistent (keep-alive) connections, pipelining, CGI execution, 
	  logging, virtual hosting, various forms of modules, and many other webserver 
	  features. TUX is now officially known as the Red Hat Content Accelerator 
	  (RHCA). </p>
    </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss2" id="ss2"></a>2. What can TUX do for me ?</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Though quite some amount of today's webcontent is dynamic generated, most 
	  of the webcontent is static. Take for example static webpages and images. 
	  This leads to quite a overhead as user-space webservers such as apache have 
	  to be use some system calls for actually serving the content. The frequent 
	  context switches between kernel-space and user-space programs is quite a 
	  performance hit. TUX is a saviour here. TUX can be built into the monolithic 
	  kernel or dynamically loaded as a module. The first approach is preferable 
	  for servers which are dedicated to webserving. When built as a loadable 
	  module, it can be dynamically inserted and removed, as when the service 
	  is started or stopped respectively. This approach affords some amount of 
	  flexibility. </p>
	<p align="justify"> TUX is used primarily for serving static content, leaving 
	  generation and serving of dynamic content to backend webservers such as 
	  Apache. Now, newer versions of TUX have the capability to cache dynamic 
	  content as well. TUX modules can create "objects" which are stored using 
	  the page cache. To respond to a request for dynamic data, a TUX module can 
	  send a mix of dynamically-generated data and cached pre-generated objects. 
	  Thus, most of the requests which are just "network-copy" operations can 
	  be handled efficiently by TUX. The new version of TUX uses zero copy block 
	  IO instead of a temporary buffer as in TUX 1.0. Also virtual hosting support 
	  has been enhanced for TUX and the number of virtual hosts that can be supported 
	  is only limited by disk space and RAM. </p>
    </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss3" id="ss3"></a>3. Getting started with TUX </h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Now that we know what TUX is capable of, we can move to installing and 
	  configuring TUX. All the information that follows has been tested on Red 
	  Hat 7.2 with TUX-2.1.0-2. Due to ease of use and familiarity Apache has 
	  been used as the user-space webserving daemon. </p>
	<h3><a name="ss3.1" id="ss3.1"></a>3.1 Step 1. Installing TUX </h3>
	<p>Check whether you have tux installed using the command :- </p>
	<pre class="sample">
# rpm -q tux
</pre>
	<p align="justify"> You may get messages similar to the ones below :</p>
	<ol>
	  <li> tux-2.1.0-2 (TUX is installed and the version number is printed) </li>
	  <li> package tux is not installed (obvious!!)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If TUX is not installed, download the rpm (or source package) you can install 
	  it using the following command: </p>
	<ol>
	  <li> for RPM packages <br />
		<pre class="sample">
# rpm -ivh tux-2.1.0-2.i386.rpm 
</pre>
	  </li>
	  <li> for Source packages patch the kernel 
		<pre class="sample">
# patch -p0 < tux2-full-2.4.10
# make oldconfig (enable tux here,recompile and install the kernel)
</pre>
		Install the user-space utilities 
		<pre class="sample">
# tar xzvf tux-2.1.0.tar.gz 
# cd tux-2.0.25 
# make 
# make instal</pre>
	  </li>
	</ol>
    <h3><a name="ss3.2" id="ss3.2"></a>3.2 Step 2. Setting the stage </h3>
	<p>Create the directory /var/www/html (or some other directory of our choice) 
	  and make it the root directory of TUX by changing the value of DOCROOT in 
	  /etc/sysconfig/tux. Also you can give the path where your CGI-scripts are 
	  stored to CGIROOT. Also the TUXTHREADS variable can be set to an appropriate 
	  number here. Also create the index.html page in the root directory. This 
	  will be used for testing later. </p>
	<h3><a name="ss3.3" id="ss3.3"></a>3.3 Step 3. Starting TUX </h3>
	<p>TUX can be started by using the command. (As superuser)</p>
	<pre class="sample">
# service tux start (on RH systems)
# ./tux.init start (on non-RH systems)
# lsmod
Module	size 	Used by
tux 	75568	0	
....
....
</pre>
	<p>Now point your favorite browser to localhost and you should see the index.html 
	  page we created earlier. If not something has gone wrong or the configuration 
	  is not proper. Check step 8 for details. </p>
	<pre class="sample">
# lynx localhost
</pre>
	<h3><a name="ss3.4" id="ss3.4"></a>3.4 Step 4. Enabling Logging </h3>
	<p>By default, logging is disabled. To enable logging and referrer logging, 
	  give the following commands.</p>
	<pre class="sample">
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/tux/logging
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/tux/referer_logging
# cat /proc/sys/net/tux/logfile
/var/log/tux (this is the default logfile)
</pre>
	<p align="justify">For each request, TUX logs the address of the requester, 
	  a date and time stamp accurate to at least one second, specification of 
	  the file requested, size of the file transferred, and the final status of 
	  the request. The log files for TUX are stored in /var/log/tux (as seen above) 
	  in binary format. In this binary format, the log files are approximately 
	  50% smaller than standard ASCII text log files. To view log files issue 
	  the following command</p>
	<pre class="sample">
# tux2w3c /var/log/tux
127.0.0.1 - - Wed Nov 20 00:22:24 2002 "GET /manual/sections.html HTTP/1.1" - 5523 200
127.0.0.1 - - Thu Nov 21 01:36:55 2002 "GET / HTTP/1.0" - 2890 200
127.0.0.1 - - Thu Nov 21 01:37:20 2002 "GET /manual/index.html HTTP/1.0" - 5557 200
127.0.0.1 - - Thu Nov 21 01:37:24 2002 "GET /manual/mod/index-bytype.html HTTP/1.0" - 6186 200
</pre>
	<p>The tux2w3c program converts the binary log files into into standard W3C-conforming 
	  HTTPD log files. </p>
	<h3><a name="ss3.5" id="ss3.5"></a>3.5 Step 5. Enabling Gzip Compression </h3>
	<p>As we already know TUX is all about speeding up the response time. Using 
	  Gzip compression, it is also possible to reduce the download time as well 
	  as save some bandwidth. But for this feature to work the client must support 
	  Gzip compression. By default, this data compression is disabled. To enable 
	  it, do the following:</p>
	<pre class="sample">
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/tux/compression
</pre>
	<p>To enable it at startup add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf </p>
	<pre class="sample">
net.tux.compression=1    
</pre>
	<p>Also Gzip file with the extension .gz must be in the same directory as 
	  the uncompressed versions of the pages you wish to serve. </p>
	<h3><a name="ss3.6" id="ss3.6"></a>3.6 Step 6. Tweaking TUX </h3>
	<p>We are not finished with configuration yet. There are some more interesting 
	  features/tweaks which you can use. (Some of these are available only in 
	  RHCA v2.2)</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> <b> application_protocol </b> <br />
		If set to 1 this enables the RHCA FTP server. By default it is set to 
		1.</li>
	  <li> <b> virtual_server </b> <br />
		When set to 1 ,it turns on mass virtual hosting. Hosts are headers from 
		the browser that are directly turned into $DOCROOT/<host> (virtual docroots) 
		This way any number of hosts can be served by TUX without any performance 
		penalty at all.</li>
	  <li> <b> max_backlog </b> <br />
		Maximum size of SYN backlog of the TUX listening socket. This has to be 
		set sensibly to prevent SYN attacks. Default is 2048.</li>
	  <li> <b> http_dir_indexing </b> <br />
		If set to 1, TUX will list files in readable directories if an index file 
		does not exist. (auto-generation of index.html)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are lots of more parameters that can be configured to maximize the 
	  performance of the TUX webserver. Explore and tweak them to your heart's 
	  content. </p>
	<h3><a name="ss3.7" id="ss3.7"></a>3.7 Step 7. Configuring Apache to work 
	  with TUX </h3>
	<p>As mentioned before, the recommended configuration is to use TUX as a front-end 
	  Web server listening on port 80(the default http port) and to use a back-end 
	  Web server (Apache is used here as an example) on port 8080 for answering 
	  requests that TUX does not understand (generally dynamically generated content 
	  eg.PHP pages). For this configuration, some changes have to be made to the 
	  httpd.conf file of Apache webserver.</p>
	<pre class="sample">
Replace the line
Port 80 

with
Port 8080 (port on which Apache will listen)
</pre>
	<p>Also to prevent users from bypassing TUX and directly accessing apache 
	  make the following changes. This may be necessary for security reasons. 
	</p>
	<pre class="sample">
Replace the line
BindAddress *

with
BindAddress 127.0.0.1 (loopback address)
</pre>
	<p>Finally, restart httpd using </p>
	<pre class="sample">
# service httpd restart
</pre>
	<h3><a name="ss3.8" id="ss3.8"></a>3.8 Step 8. Debugging and Restarting TUX 
	</h3>
	<p align="justify">You can stop/restart TUX using the following commands:</p>
	<pre class="sample">
# service tux stop (for RH-Systems)
OR 
# ./tux-init stop (for non-RH Systems)

# service tux restart
OR
# ./tux-init restart
</pre>
	<p>For debugging purposes you can use the <i> gettuxconfig </i> script in 
	  the /usr/share/doc/tux-version/ directory. If you have an SMP system you 
	  can check whether all the interfaces have been setup properly using the 
	  <i> checkbindings </i>scripts. It is also present in the same directory. 
	</p>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss4" id="ss4"></a>4. Conclusion</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>As we have seen above, TUX helps a lot to improve the efficiency of webservers 
	  by shifting some of the operations from user-space to kernel-space. This 
	  results in better performance and better use of server resources. TUX is 
	  very configurable and has a number of interesting features. Hope you enjoyed 
	  the article. Happy Hacking!! </p>
