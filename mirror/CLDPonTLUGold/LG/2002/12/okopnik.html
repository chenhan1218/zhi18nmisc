UIDs.

Frink Ooblick
</pre>
	<p>Woomert Foonly, the Hard-Nosed Computer Detective, chuckled to himself. 
	  The client had been rather loud and incoherent on the phone, with "It doesn't 
	  work!" and "I need help!" being the chief features of his conversation. 
	  Woomert had sent Frink to the site to reconnoiter, and the above was the 
	  highly satisfactory result. All that remained was to come up with the solution; 
	  given that only a few short hours remained before the client shut down for 
	  the day, Woomert decided to use his time productively. Let's see - where 
	  was his favorite pillow?... </p>
    </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss2" id="ss2"></a>2. Chapter 2</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Refreshed and ready, Woomert appeared at the site, and immediately encountered 
	  a rather excited Frink.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;- "Woomert, it's terrible! The file is far too long to search manually, 
	  and the UIDs are all over the map. The sysadmin is contrite, frantic, and 
	  panicked by turns, and his hair is almost all gone. What can we do?"</p>
	<p>&nbsp;- "No worries, mate... oh, sorry. I was just in Canberra a few hours 
	  ago, and some of the influence is still with me. I can tell you from horrible 
	  experience that tomorrow will be even worse: I've got to be in Dallas in 
	  the morning, New York in the afternoon, and Tel Aviv in the evening. I would 
	  advise you to wear earplugs, or absent yourself from my environs until the 
	  accents fade. Ah, the perils of travel..."</p>
	<p>Frink was becoming visibly upset.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;- "Woomert - you're not taking this seriously. Can't you see that 
	  this is a major problem?"</p>
	<p>&nbsp;- "Oh, this? Relax, take it easy. It's not nearly as bad as it looks, 
	  Frink; in fact..."</p>
	<p>Woomert deftly extracted his favorite typing gloves from his pocket and 
	  slipped them on.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;- "...Perl makes it rather trivial. What we'll do is give the sysadmin 
	  a couple of command-line tools that he can use to resolve this problem, 
	  and - since he's using 'bash' - he'll be able to pull them up with the 'up-arrow' 
	  key as he needs them. Here we go!"</p>
	<pre class="sample">
perl -F: -walne'$h{$F[2]}.="$F[0] ";END{$h{$_}=~/ ./&amp;&amp;print"$_: $h{$_}"for keys%h}' /etc/passwd
</pre>
	<p>A list of duplicate UIDs, along with their related usernames scrolled down 
	  the screen after Woomert pressed the "Enter"&nbsp;key. Both Woomert and 
	  Frink noted with interest that there was a <b>triple</b> entry for UID0 
	  - </p>
	<p><tt>0: root sashroot kill3r</tt></p>
	<p>&nbsp;- "Well, well. Looks like somebody managed to break in and give themselves 
	  a UID0 (root) account. 'sashroot'&nbsp;is OK - that's the 'standalone shell'&nbsp;for 
	  those rough repair jobs - but 'kill3r'? Well, we'll let the client know; 
	  meanwhile, on with the current problem. The sysadmin will now have a list 
	  of all the duplicates - there don't seem to be all that many - but searching 
	  for the next available UID&nbsp;could be a pain. So, here's a second tool 
	  -"</p>
	<pre class="sample">
perl -wle'{getpwuid++$n&amp;&amp;redo;print$n}'</pre>
	<p>&nbsp;- "That should give him a good start on getting it all straightened 
	  out. As for us - we're homeward bound!" </p>
	</div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss3" id="ss3"></a>3. Chapter 3</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>When they had returned to Woomert's house and were seated in front of the 
	  fireplace - the night had been a cold one, and the wind whistled outside 
	  the window - Frink looked expectantly at Woomert. Noting the look, Woomert 
	  laughed.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;- "I know, I know. I should explain, shouldn't I? The air of mystery 
	  is a sharp, pleasant thing, but it is as nothing compared to the pleasure 
	  of learning. Here, let's start with the first one:</p>
	<pre class="sample">
perl -F: -walne'$h{$F[2]}.="$F[0] ";END{$h{$_}=~/ ./&amp;&amp;print"$_: $h{$_}"for keys%h}' /etc/passwd</pre>
	<p>"First, take a look at the command-line switches I used:" </p>
	<pre class="sample">
-w Enable warnings
-a Autosplit (see "-F")
-l Enable line-end processing
-n Implicit non-printing loop
-e Execute the following commands
-F:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use ':' as the separator for the '-a' autosplit
</pre>
	<p>"If you remember our <a href="../issue84/okopnik.html">last adventure</a>, 
	  all of the above except '-a' and '-F' are already familiar to you. Autosplitting 
	  splits the lines read in by '-n' or '-p', using whitespace as a default 
	  separator and saving the result in the '@F' array. '-F' optionally redefines 
	  the separator by which to split." </p>
	<p>"Since we're reading in '/etc/passwd', let's look at the format of the 
	  individual lines in it:"</p>
	<pre class="sample">borg:x:1026:127:All your base are belong to us!:/home/borg:/bin/bash</pre>
	<p>"There are seven standard fields, laid out as 'name - passwd - UID - GID 
	  - GECOS - dir - shell'. The only things we're interested in for the moment 
	  are name and UID; what I'm going to do is build a hash - a very important 
	  data structure in Perl, one of the three basic ones - that contains the 
	  UID (3rd field)&nbsp;as the <b>key</b>, and the name (1st field), followed 
	  by a space, as the <b>value</b>, for all the entries in '/etc/passwd': </p>
	<pre class="sample">$h{$F[2]}.="$F[0] "</pre>
	<p>Since usernames can't have spaces in them, it makes a convenient separator. 
	  Once that's done, I'll loop over the hash and print out any value which 
	  contains a space followed by any character:" <br />
	  &nbsp; </p>
	<pre class="sample">$h{$_}=~/ ./&amp;&amp;print"$_: $h{$_}"for keys%h}</pre>
	<p>"I see you still look puzzled. Here, let me write out the above in a more 
	  readable form:" </p>
	<pre class="sample"><tt>for (&nbsp;keys %h ){&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  	  #&nbsp;Loop over the "%h"&nbsp;hash</tt> <tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (&nbsp;$h{$_} =~ / ./ ){&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	  # Does the value contain a space followed by anything?</tt> 
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "$_: $h{$_}\n";&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	  #&nbsp;If so, print the UID, a colon, a space, and the value</tt> 
	  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt> 
	  <tt>}</tt></pre>
	<p>"If you think about it, you'll see that the only thing that will match 
	  the above regex is a value with more than one name in it - meaning a duplicate 
	  UID."</p>
	<p>&nbsp;- "All right - now I&nbsp;can see how you got the results. What about 
	  the second expression, the 'next available UID'&nbsp;tool?"</p>
	<p>&nbsp;- "Ah, you mean this one:"</p>
	<pre class="sample">perl -wle'{getpwuid++$n&amp;&amp;redo;print$n}'  	</pre>
	<p>"It's nothing but a short loop in which I&nbsp;check if the UID specified 
	  by '$n' exists. If that test succeeds - meaning that there <b>is</b> a UID 
	  equal to '$n' in use - 'redo' gets invoked, '$n' is incremented, and the 
	  test happens again. If it fails, however, '$n' is printed to STDOUT and 
	  the program exits. Useful, and not too complicated. Just a bit of work, 
	  and they should have it all done. The security breach is something else, 
	  but at least now they know about it..." </p>
