    <h2>前言</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>This article explores Linux's potential role in assistive technology (AT). 
	  AT allows those living with multiple schlerosis, other handicaps or the 
	  affects of aging to take greater control in maintaining their health and 
	  living independently. </p>

  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss1" id="ss1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Some of the most criminal and immoral aspects of the monopolistic practices 
	  of Microsoft, which for all practical purposes eliminated or curtailed competition, 
	  is the fact that PCs today are</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> much too expensive.</li>
	  <li> insanely unreliable.</li>
	  <li> maddeningly complex.</li>
	</ul>
	<p> These negative attributes of the Windows world makes the PCs of today 
	  useless for the truly needy:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> the aging population.</li>
	  <li> the physically disabled.</li>
	  <li> the learning disabled.</li>
	  <li> and the professionals working with all the above.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The sum of these people account for more than half the population of the 
	  world. They are in need of a collaborative assistive technology (AT) system 
	  which operates with telephone-style simplicity. An end-to-end AT-based collaborative 
	  system connected via the Web will allow the professionals to provide support 
	  group-style assistance in the form of a simple virtual community. </p>
	<p> Now that Linux is available, it is feasible to approach this very large 
	  market using a low-cost, rugged and simple client system. Linux-based client 
	  systems connected to Linux servers are perfect for such end-to-end AT systems 
	  offering. The reliable and simple features of Linux coupled with low cost 
	  Linux based hardware and platforms and applications are the only solution 
	  for these end users who need AT capabilities. </p>
    </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss2" id="ss2"></a>2. The work to be done</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>A very significant upgrade of self-supported health improvement can be 
	  achieved using assistive technologies (AT) connected via the Web. Recent 
	  scientific studies by major universities in the field of behavioral medicine 
	  including psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) indicate that getting involved with 
	  collaborative group activities has significant rehabilitation potential. 
	  In fact behavioral medicine can prevent disease, and improve quality of 
	  life and rehabilitate. Of course it does not replace the pharmaceuticals, 
	  but it does improve their effectiveness. </p>
	<p> It is suggested that the collaborative virtual community systems, based 
	  on Web-connected AT clients and servers, supporting the disabled and the 
	  aging can also be used for the able-bodied eyes-busy, hands-busy professionals 
	  to improve their productivity. Also learning-disabled children can make 
	  very good use of AT. This low cost set of AT platforms and associated Web 
	  connectivity could be very useful in many government and commercial employment 
	  arenas. This dual-use type approach will significantly lower the cost of 
	  the needed technologies for all groups. </p>
	<p> Of course there is still work to be done. Applications for AT technologies 
	  must be developed or perfected to allow collaboration between the health 
	  service professionals or social worker professionals and the many people 
	  in need. Web connected AT oriented software components running on Linux 
	  client machines connected to Linux servers have to be created such as</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> simple and application specific user interface.</li>
	  <li> voice based interaction via computer/telephone.</li>
	  <li> always-on and always-available systems.</li>
	  <li> a collaborative virtual community systems.</li>
	</ul>
	<p> Through such systems the professionals can monitor, mentor and moderate 
	  and even medicate the members of the collaborative community. For a good 
	  example: when dealing with students with learning disabilities, it is important 
	  to get their attention, to bolster their behavior and finally to improve 
	  their cognitive productivity. With assistive technology people can prevent 
	  further destruction of their faculties, improve their quality of life and 
	  can even be rehabilitated somewhat. Just the idea of being productive adds 
	  to a person's self-esteem enormously. </p>
    </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss3" id="ss3"></a>3. A personal example</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>I have many years of personal experience using AT and found it very helpful 
	  in SPMS (secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) conditions as described 
	  below in a brief review of my personal experiences. </p>
	<p> In addition to my extensive experience with AT I also have related graduate 
	  credentials from both California State Univ at Northridge (the center for 
	  AT corporate interactions) as well as CSU in Sacramento and UOP in Stockton. 
	</p>
	<p> In spite of my handicap, I find it gratifying and fulfilling to concentrate 
	  my efforts on projects worthwhile to a very deserving community. Involvement 
	  such as this has proved to have healing powers for me. I am living proof 
	  of the powers of PNI based on personal involvement. </p>
	<p> Having relied on AT in order to survive my wheelchair imprisonment, specifically 
	  voice recognition for writing, I see dual value: one for the hands-busy, 
	  eyes-busy professionals increasing their productivity through ease of use, 
	  and the other, of course, for use by the physically disabled. </p>
	<p> Being disabled with MS, I use IBM ViaVoice on a MAC to write. It allows 
	  me to verbally communicate by email with my friends as well as giving me 
	  the opportunity to express myself and get involved with worthwhile projects 
	  in the AT arena. </p>
	<p> Typically voice recognition systems spell very well but now and then some 
	  of them do make typos which really take the cake:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> emerge -&gt; eat March</li>
	  <li> inevitable -&gt; in edit a bowl</li>
	  <li> Nazi -&gt; not see</li>
	  <li> multiple schlerosis -&gt; multiple skull roses</li>
	  <li> idiosyncracies -&gt; HBO sink receives</li>
	  <li> A loud sneeze from my husband nearby inspires the computer to type 
		"aha".</li>
	</ul>
	<p> I receive enduring fulfillment from developing my intellectual strengths 
	  and putting them to positive use. I learn from my negative experiences which 
	  have been many in my 54 years of existence and I savor my positive experiences 
	  to learn optimism. </p>
	<p> The best way to use these intellectual strengths is to get involved with 
	  collaborative teamwork and personal communications within the disabled community 
	  and with companies who provide assistive technologies for this community. 
	</p>
	<p> It is important for me to maintain what little health I have and to become 
	  involved in something I hold great faith in. So I have decided to become 
	  involved in the latest AT systems available to people with disabilities. 
	  I am especially interested in technologies that help the disabled express 
	  themselves, such as voice recognition for writing and voice-activated telephone 
	  service for talking. </p>
	<p> There are many AT type technologies that focus on, and make good use of 
	  the physical abilities a disabled person may still have such as voice, lip 
	  movement, eye motion and brain waves. These capabilities can be used with 
	  brain-actuated computer systems and voice recognition software, to name 
	  a few. Integrating these already-existing technologies into something usable 
	  by disabled clients so they can express themselves will offer them freedom 
	  in spite of their handicap. </p>
	<p> Understanding that there are companies already seeking to address this 
	  market makes my involvement in the area that much easier and completely 
	  natural. Finding companies geared toward brain-actuated computer control 
	  systems is my next assignment. </p>
	<p> As a handicapped woman who still has control of her mental faculties and 
	  voice, I have something to offer by connecting the right people so that 
	  I can integrate systems through the Internet to develop a mutually beneficial 
	  virtual community. </p>
    </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss4" id="ss4"></a>4. Conclusion</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Personal communications and collaborative teamwork need assistive technologies 
	  to further the self-esteem of the disabled. Linux, due to its low cost, 
	  open architecture and international development, provides an ideal platform 
	  for building these technologies. Those living with handicaps (and their 
	  relatives and friends) can make a unique contribution to this effort because 
	  they know firsthand what benefits AT can provide. </p>
	<p> Involvement in AT projects can help disabled people in another way too. 
	  Not only does it provide a distraction from their problems, but it's also 
	  a constructive way to spend their time while furthering a cause they believe 
	  in. </p>
	<p> The positive rehabilitative effects of Behavioral Medicine is my method 
	  of surviving and thriving until a final cure for MS is developed. </p>
    </div>

  <div> 
	<p>LG would like to see additional articles and Mailbag letters about Linux's 
	  applicability in assistive technology. If you have any ideas, let us know.
