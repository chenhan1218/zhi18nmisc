	<h2><a name="ss1" id="ss1"></a>1. Washing flooded chips</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Here's what happened to me a few years ago when computers were not so cheap 
	  and a group of 5 very old machines were worth saving from a flood. </p>
	<p> I was working in a Laboratory at the time. We had a room with 2 big microscopes 
	  and 5 old Macs used for image analysis. The room ended up flooded during 
	  the night after an autoclave (kind of big pressure cooker that biologically-inclined 
	  geeks use to sterilize things) broke down. Although the microscopes were 
	  safe, the table with the Macs got hit. All the machine ended up covered 
	  with a muddy rusty water. </p>
	<p> The next morning, I decided to bring the Macs to the lab to dismantle 
	  them. By chance the drives and power supply were dry but the motherboards 
	  were in really bad shape. </p>
	<p> I washed all the cards in distilled water and then in alcohol. I then 
	  put them in an oven at 40 degrees Celsius for a day. </p>
	<p> Everyone was smiling at me until I rebuilt the Mac and got them running 
	  again. At the time, I did not know that it was the way electronic boards 
	  were washed in fact, and I was not really sure of the result before it came. 
	</p>
	<p> In the meantime, the machines got reimbursed by the insurance that did 
	  not consider worth getting the old one back, so we doubled our investment 
	  in the computers. </p>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss2" id="ss2"></a>2. A foolish HDD fail</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Once upon a time (maybe 4-5 years ago), I had a 80286 case for old timess 
	  sake. But its floppy drive wasn't working. So I decided to use my Pentium 
	  II' s floppy with it. I was trying to install a DOS 6.22 system on it think. 
	  But i wasn't able to take the floppy out of its original case. A bit acrobaticly 
	  I put the cases in parallel and with a long cable connected the floppy to 
	  286. Everything was OK. </p>
	<p> But there was something wrong. (Did I metioned the pentium was where my 
	  father did his civil-engineering tasks?) The floppy's LED was on continuoussly. 
	  I was in a hurry and didn't think the cable was wrongly plugged. The PC 
	  didn't boot. The system was down. It should be the doom. I got angry and 
	  started to hit the floppy drive with a hammer. After that I got the idea 
	  of the cable. HIT! Everything seemed to be ok then. But i got a damaged 
	  HDD. The HDD was below the floppy.. The real doom :) But the good thing 
	  was that I had that drive backed up. </p>
	<p> So never work without backups and hammers when working inside the case. 
	</p>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss3" id="ss3"></a>3. Computer Abuse</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Probably the most expensive learning experience in my history was hooking 
	  up a second drive, a used 20mb Miniscribe SCSI 3.5" as the second in a chain 
	  to my Amiga 2000 years ago. I didn't know about SCSI termination, and back 
	  then, it was real important. I watched in dazed amazement as a single wire 
	  on the cable smoked and burnt down toward the first drive, like the black 
	  powder burning toward the weapons room in a Looney Toons featuring Bugs 
	  Bunny and Yosemite Sam as the pirate. At probably the last possible second, 
	  I broke the trance and lunged forward, groping around the back of the machine 
	  for the power switch. I got it just in time. I only lost the 20mb SCSI. 
	</p>
	<p> About a year later, I got a job at a used retail computer store, and found 
	  a dead miniscribe 20mb among the waste products. I removed the controller 
	  card, swapped it out with the controller on my drive, and brought life back 
	  to my drive. That evening, it was resting on the corner of a desk, and a 
	  co-worker bumped it and it fell onto the concrete floor. That was the end 
	  of that drive. </p>
	<p> I think I paid $200 for the drive, used. Needless to say, I shortly became 
	  an expert in proper termination of SCSI chains. :) </p>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<h2><a name="ss4" id="ss4"></a>4. The Monster Hard Drive</h2>
  </div>
  <div> 
	<p>Years ago now (about 1989 or so) I was the grateful recipient of an old 
	  XT that no one wanted. I hadn't had much to do with computers up until then 
	  on the hardware side - but this one came in pieces, so it was a matter of 
	  getting my sleeves rolled up an' putting it all together. </p>
	<p> It was great - a complete change to the ol' Commodore 64 and plus 4 that 
	  I'd played with before. But I kept getting this wierd problem. The hard 
	  drive ( a monster and a half) -- all of twenty megabytes, and in a double-height 
	  casing (so it weighed a ton) -- was connected to the IDE controller card, 
	  which in turn was seated into the motherboard). When switching on the computer 
	  everything was fine. The old XT booted up with its old (DOS 3 I think) OS 
	  and worked fine. But whenever I tried to format or delete any of the old 
	  stuff on it it seemed fine until next reboot, when everything was still 
	  there. Wierd. </p>
	<p> So I took it along to a computer shop with a workshop and admitted to 
	  being completely baffled by the phenomenon. The techie took one look at 
	  the ribbon cable connecting the hard drive to the IDE controller and unplugged 
	  it and plugged it so that it was seated over BOTH rows of pins. I had plugged 
	  the cable in so that one whole row of pins had been missed. </p>
	<p> Needless to say, I was one really embarrassed teenager! Needless to say 
	  as well that it has never happened again - some mistakes are just too stupid 
	  to repeat! </p>
