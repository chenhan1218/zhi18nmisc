<P>(中译略)
<P>I quoted several bits from Frederick P. Brooks's classic <EM>The
Mythical Man-Month</EM> because, in many respects, his insights have
yet to be improved upon.  I heartily recommend the 25th Anniversary
edition from Addison-Wesley (ISBN 0-201-83595-9), which adds his 1986
<EM>``No Silver Bullet''</EM> paper.
<P>The new edition is wrapped up by an invaluable 20-years-later
retrospective in which Brooks forthrightly admits to the few
judgements in the original text which have not stood the test of time.
I first read the retrospective after this paper was substantially
complete, and was surprised to discover that Brooks attributes
bazaar-like practices to Microsoft! (In fact, however, this 
attribution turned out to be mistaken. In 1998 we learned from
the 
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html">Halloween Documents</A> that Microsoft's internal developer
community is heavily balkanized, with the kind of general source
access needed to support a bazaar not even truly possible.)
<P>
<P>Gerald M. Weinberg's <EM>The Psychology Of Computer Programming</EM>
(New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold 1971) introduced the rather
unfortunately-labeled concept of ``egoless programming''.  While he was
nowhere near the first person to realize the futility of the
``principle of command'', he was probably the first to recognize and
argue the point in particular connection with software development.
<P>
<P>Richard P. Gabriel, contemplating the Unix culture of the pre-Linux
era, reluctantly argued for the superiority of a primitive bazaar-like
model in his 1989 paper <EM>Lisp: Good News, Bad News, and How To Win
Big</EM>.  Though dated in some respects, this essay is still rightly
celebrated among Lisp fans (including me).  A correspondent reminded
me that the section titled ``Worse Is Better'' reads almost as an
anticipation of Linux.  The paper is accessible on the World Wide Web
at 
<A HREF="http://www.naggum.no/worse-is-better.html">http://www.naggum.no/worse-is-better.html</A>.
<P>
<P>De Marco and Lister's <EM>Peopleware: Productive Projects and
Teams</EM> (New York; Dorset House, 1987; ISBN 0-932633-05-6) is an
underappreciated gem which I was delighted to see Fred Brooks cite in
his retrospective.  While little of what the authors have to say is
directly applicable to the Linux or open-source communities, the
authors' insight into the conditions necessary for creative work is
acute and worthwhile for anyone attempting to import some of the
bazaar model's virtues into a commercial context.
<P>
<P>Finally, I must admit that I very nearly called this paper ``The
Cathedral and the Agora'', the latter term being the Greek for an open
market or public meeting place.  The seminal ``agoric systems'' papers
by Mark Miller and Eric Drexler, by describing the emergent properties
of market-like computational ecologies, helped prepare me to think
clearly about analogous phenomena in the open-source culture when
Linux rubbed my nose in them five years later.  These papers are
available on the Web at
