You should read it if you are interested in modem history or are
intending to actually use an antique modem.

QAM= Quadrature Amplitude Modulation.  The word "Quadrature" is short
for "quadrature differential phase shift keying" =QDPSK

<H2><A NAME="ss26.2">26.2 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P> Before v.32  modems typically had speeds of 300 to 2400 bps.  Some
super fast ones had much higher speeds (such as 19.2k bps) and used
non-standard protocols.  To utilize these "fast" ones, both modems for
a connection usually needed to be of the same brand.
<P>Prior to the v.42 standard for error correction and the v.42bis (1990)
standard for data compression, the MNP standards were usually used for
both error correction and data compression.  An X.PC error correction
standard was used on some commercial data networks.  Compression and
error correction were available on some 2400 bps modems.
<P>Around 1980 many modems only had a speed of 300 bps (which was also
300 baud).  This is only 0.3kbps.  Modern modems are over 100 times
faster.  Some old-slow modems are still in use so they are not really
"antique" quite yet.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="autobaud_"></A> <A NAME="ss26.3">26.3 Autobauding </A>
</H2>

<H3>Various meanings</H3>

<P>This term has a few different meanings.  In general it means the
automatic adjustment of modem-to-modem speed or modem-to-serial_port
speed.
<P>
<H3>Modem-to-modem speed</H3>

<P>Modern modems negotiate the modem-to-modem speed and protocol when
they first connect to each other.  If one side can't negotiate, the
other side should accept whatever speed and protocol that the antique
modem has available.  Sometimes this is called "autobauding".  When
both modems automatically lower their speed due to a noisy line it's
called "fallback".  Thus users of modern modems (or computer programs
in your PC) don't need to deal with this (unless the S37 register has
been set so as to disable autobauding).  
<P>But many old modems didn't have such autobauding (although many had
fallback).  If you have such a modem, it will likely work OK if the
other modem you connect to is a modern one that can adjust it's speed
and protocol to yours.  But a problem arises if both modems which want
to communicate with each other are both antique and don't support
autobauding.  How was this done?
<P>In olden days, a computer dial-in site might have a number of phone
lines, each of which would have a specific speed modem on it.  For
example, if you had a 1200 bps modem then you simply only dialed in
to certain telephone numbers that supported that speed.  Once a site
obtained modems that could support various speeds on the same modem
and automatically detect the callers speed (do autobauding) then
people could call in using modems that didn't do this autobauding
(providing that their speed and protocol was supported).
<P>
<H3>Modem-to-serial_port speed</H3>

<P> When a modem modem is sent an init string (or a dial command),
the modem detects the speed of the serial port and sets it's
modem-to-serial_port speed to this value.  It does this by sensing the
speed of the "AT" at the beginning of the string.
<P>Old modems couldn't do this and one would need to set the computer's
serial port speed (with stty or the like) to the same exact value as
the modem-to-modem speed (such as 1200 bps).  If the modem had a
choice of speeds one could use the AT register S37 to select one.  But
for dial-in when there was a choice of speeds (via autobauding), if a
connection was made at say 2400 bps, then the modem-to-serial_port
speed would change to 2400 bps.  Then one would need to start getty
at 2400 bps.  Thus getty needed to adjust to whatever speed was
coming from the modem.  Since the serial port doesn't have any way to
detect what speed is being sent to it, getty would set the serial port
to a different speed (as specified in a getty configuration file) if
it couldn't communicate at the current speed.  Today it's the other
way around: the modem adjusts its modem-to-serial_port speed to
whatever speed the serial port is using.
<P>In Linux, there's a problem if the speed is set to a speed not
supported by Linux's serial port (for example 7200 bps).  You
may dial out and connect at 7200 bps (both modem-to-modem and
modem-to-serial_port speed) but you only see garbage since Linux
doesn't support 7200 on the serial port.  Once you connect there is no
simple way to hang up because even the +++ escape sequence can't be
sent to the modem over a 7200 baud interface.  
<P>To dial out by the antique method using a modern modem set &amp;Q0 N0
and S17=5 (for 1200 bps).  Some of the S17 settings vary with the make
of modem except that S17=0 is the default that connects the modern way
at the highest speed supported.
<P>The original getty program configuration file /etc/gettydefs has an
optional autobauding feature (see "next-label" in the manual) which
will change the speed of the serial port.  The agetty program has a
similar baud rate detection feature.  This was used to adjust the speed
of the serial port to the modem-to-modem speed of an incoming dial-in
call.
<P>Modern modems can use almost any serial port speed.  To do this they
employ speed buffering and flow control.  Speed buffering means that
modems have buffers so that there can be a difference between the
modem-to-modem speed and the modem-to-serial_port speed.  If the flow
entering the modem is faster than the flow exiting it, the excess flow
is simply stored in a buffer in the modem.  Then to prevent the buffer
from overflowing, the modem sends a flow control signal to stop the
input flow to the modem.  This is true for either direction of flow.
See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-4.html#flow_control">Flow Control</A> for more details.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss26.4">26.4 Before AT Commands</A>
</H2>

<P> Hayes introduced the AT command set and other modem manufacturers
adopted it as a standard.  Before the AT commands, many modems used
dip switches to configure the modem.  Another command set is the CCITT
V.25bis command set.  Some modems supported both CCITT and AT
commands.  The CCITT V.25bis also specifies how Synchronous
modem-to-serial_port communication is to take place using either the
ASCII or 8-bit EBCDIC character sets.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss26.5">26.5 Data Compression and Error Correction</A>
</H2>

<P> MNP 2, 3, or 4 were used for error correction.  MNP 5 was
compression.  Modern modems generally use V42 (error correction) and
V42bis (compression).  Many modems support both MNP and V42.
