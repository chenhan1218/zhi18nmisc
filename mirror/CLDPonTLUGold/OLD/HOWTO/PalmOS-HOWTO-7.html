<H2><A NAME="s7">7. A History of Palm OS devices.</A></H2>

<P>There are two versions of the Pilot.
They are the <I>1000</I> and the <I>5000</I> and have 128k and 512k of RAM,
respectively. They come with Palm OS 1.0 in ROM.
<P>Then came two devices with the name <I>PalmPilot</I>.
They are the <I>PalmPilot Personal</I> and the <I>PalmPilot Professional</I>
and have 512k and 1 Meg of RAM, respectively.
They also have a backlighting feature for the LCD panel and version
2.0 of the operating system.
The <I>Professional</I> also comes with a TCP/IP stack and a few extra
programs built-in.
<P>IBM has released a rebadged version of the PalmPilot Professional,
which they call a <I>WorkPad</I>.
<P>Now we have the Palm III, which has a redesigned case and an infrared
port, not to mention the 2 Meg of RAM and Palm OS 3.0.
<P>There is an announced product from Qualcomm, called the <I>pdQ smartphone</I>,
which is a cell phone that incorporates a Palm OS PDA.
Don't get all excited about it yet, it will not be released until sometime
in 1999.
<P>It is possible to upgrade any Pilot by swapping out the memory card,
which includes both RAM &amp; ROM.
Of course, this doesn't get you backlighting for the original Pilot
series.
