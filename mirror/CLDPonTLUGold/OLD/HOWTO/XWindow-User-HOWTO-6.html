<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Configuring the Window Manager</A></H2>

<P>Now we take a look at the files to configure your window
manager. These vary from manager to manager, but for our examples we
will focus on the per-user files, and we are looking at FVWM2 in this
example, so you will modify the file <EM>.fvwm2rc</EM> in your home
directory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Basic FVWM2 Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>Configuring your window manager resource file in earlier versions of
FVWM was a rather arduous process, because the order of the items in
the
file needed to be very particular, but that has relaxed quite a bit in
this version. To my knowledge, the only crucial part of the ordering is
the bindings for the menus, but we'll cover that a bit later. Your
FVWM2
installation should have come with an example resource file, and you
should be able to find that in
<EM>/var/X11R6/lib/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc</EM>. This is the default
system-wide configuration file. A good idea would be to copy that file
into your home directory and call it <EM>.fvwm2rc</EM>. From that point
on, when FVWM2 starts up it will read the file in your home directory,
and ignore the system-wide configuration file.
<P>Now that you've got a working, personalized copy of the window manager
resource file in your home directory, open it in your favorite text
editor, and take a look at it. If you're in X at the moment, you can
see
the correlation between the file and what you see on your desktop. Very
helpful indeed. Let's try changing something and see if we can make it
look a little better. Probably the first entry in your file (that is
not
followed by the <CODE>#</CODE> comment character) is the
<CODE>WindowFont</CODE> entry, followed by a very bizarre font name. If you
want to figure out how to set up the fonts and colors to their fullest,
skip ahead to the next section on X Fonts and Colors.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Advanced FVWM2 Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>Configuring FVWM2 can get incredibly subtle and complex. Take this
code snippet from the <B>fvwm2gnome</B> setup for the
<EM>.fvwm2rc</EM> file:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 # import config files
 
 Echo -Styles- 
 Read .fvwm2gnome/config/styles/app.styles
 Read .fvwm2gnome/config/styles/window.styles
 
 Echo -Buttons &amp; Keys-
 Read .fvwm2gnome/config/buttons.config
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is an example of a way to read in other configurations. In this
fashion you can modularize your <EM>.fvwm2rc</EM> -- not a bad idea,
considering how jumbled one huge configuration file can become. This
can make it easier to change and to debug, and it also makes it
easier to configure so-called <EM>themes</EM>, which we will cover in
a moment.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 FVWM2 Configuration Shortcuts</A>
</H2>

<P>A really neat way to configure your script for FVWM2 (and FVWM, and
<B>bash</B>, and a whole lot of other programs besides!) is to use
the <B>Dotfile Generator</B>, by Jesper K. Pedersen, available from
<A HREF="http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile/">http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile/</A>.  You will
need to have a recent version of <B>Tcl/Tk</B> installed (available
with most Linux distributions). This program starts with a
configuration preset, or takes the one you presently have, and allows
you to tweak it via many structured menus of options.
<P>Be warned, however, for I advise learning how to set up your
configuration file yourself! Not only is this the <EM>Unix Way</EM>
(for what that's worth) but it's much easier to make small and
incremental changes to your <CODE>.fvwm2rc</CODE> file that way, and get
things exactly how you like them. Also, being a <B>Tcl/Tk</B>
program, it's a little slow. Nevertheless, if you want a painless way
to start with a decent configuration, this is definitely worth a
shot.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 FVWM2 Themes</A>
</H2>

<P>Among the many new possibilities of FVWM2 are something commonly
called <EM>themes</EM>. This basically means that you can switch
between a basic look for all of your windows on your desktop, on the
fly. Note that if you've made the distinction between the functions
of the window manager and the functions of the applications
themselves, you will realize that a window manager theme is not going
to affect the look and feel of the applications
themselves. Integrated toolkits such as KDE and GNOME do have this
capability, however, and the two might be used together very
effectively.
<P>In order to generate a theme, you must roll up your sleeves and modify
your
<EM>.fvwm2rc</EM> file a little bit. Here's something I added near the
beginning of
my file, try putting it right after your <CODE>Style</CODE> definitions:
<P>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That's a lot to swallow, I know. Basically we're first defining a
theme called ``<CODE>Blue</CODE>,'' and you can use that first half as a
model to design other themes. Themes can describe many more features
than that, in fact, and can be quite remarkably different from one
another. Then we're defining a function to change all the windows to
a new style. Notice in both sections above that we destroy the object
before creating it. This is a good idea since you may well be
restarting FVWM2 a lot to try out your different styles, and this
makes it work a bit more smoothly.
<P>The function call is needed as a generic interface to call the
definitions of the styles we have defined. Now we will make the menu
items to call them.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 DestroyMenu &quot;Themes&quot;
 AddToMenu &quot;Themes&quot;
 + &quot;Choose a theme...&quot; Title
 + &quot;&quot; Nop
 + &quot;Blue&quot; ChangeStyle &quot;*&quot; &quot;UseStyle Blue&quot;
 + &quot;Mwm&quot; ChangeStyle &quot;*&quot; &quot;UseStyle Mwm&quot;
 + &quot;Flat&quot; ChangeStyle &quot;*&quot; &quot;UseStyle Flat&quot;
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We're being a little terse with the menu definition here, but there
should be a lot more in the sample file on your system. What we're
doing is calling the <CODE>ChangeStyle</CODE> function that we defined
above to change the style for all the windows on the screen to one of
the presets we defined above that. Notice, again, our good practice
in destroying the menu before creating it. Now if you restart FVWM2
(you should also have a menu option for that, hopefully!)  you will
see a new <CODE>Themes</CODE> menu selection, and you should be able to
try out the different themes.
