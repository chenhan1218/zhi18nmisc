<H2><A NAME="s19">19. Migrations from old to new setups</A> </H2>

<P>This section is only to be used by people who have installed a LFS system
using previous versions of this HOWTO. If a major change in an installation
approach has taken place, you first need to take some actions such as removing
existing files from a package before you can re-install that package. This
section is used to assist people who obtained an old, obsolete version of this
HOWTO and after installing the LFS system noticed that there's a new HOWTO
(like this one) fixing things that went wrong in the older versions.
