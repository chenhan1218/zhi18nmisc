<H2><A NAME="general"></A> <A NAME="s3">3. General Non-Device Specific Boot Args</A></H2>

<P>These are the boot arguments that are not related to any
specific device or peripheral. They are instead related to
certain internal kernel parameters, such as memory handling,
ramdisk handling, root file system handling and others.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Root Filesystem options</A>
</H2>

<P>The following options all pertain to how the kernel selects
and handles the root filesystem.
<P>
<H3>The `root=' Argument</H3>

<P>This argument tells the kernel what device is to be used as
the root filesystem while booting. The default of this setting
is the value of the root device of the system that
the kernel was built on.
For example, if the kernel in question was built on a system
that used `/dev/hda1' as the root partition, then the default
root device would be `/dev/hda1'.  To override this default
value, and select the second floppy drive as the root device,
one would use `root=/dev/fd1'.
<P>Valid root devices are any of the following devices:
<P>(1) /dev/hdaN to /dev/hddN, which is partition N on ST-506
compatible disk `a to d'.
<P>(2) /dev/sdaN to /dev/sdeN, which is partition N on SCSI
compatible disk `a to e'.
<P>(3) /dev/xdaN to /dev/xdbN, which is partition N on XT
compatible disk `a to b'.
<P>(4) /dev/fdN, which is floppy disk drive number N. Having
N=0 would be the DOS `A:' drive, and N=1 would be `B:'.
<P>(5) /dev/nfs, which is not really a device, but rather a
flag to tell the kernel to get the root fs via the network.
<P>The more awkward and less portable numeric specification
of the above possible disk devices in major/minor format is
also accepted. (e.g. /dev/sda3 is major 8, minor 3, so you
could use <CODE>root=0x803</CODE> as an alternative.)
<P>This is one of the few kernel boot arguments that has its
default stored in the kernel image, and which can thus
be altered with the <CODE>rdev</CODE> utility.
<P>
<P>
<H3>The `ro' Argument</H3>

<P>When the kernel boots, it needs a root filesystem to read
basic things off of. This is the root filesystem that is
mounted at boot. However, if the root filesystem is mounted
with write access, you can not reliably check the filesystem
integrity with half-written files in progress. The `ro'
option tells the kernel to mount the root filesystem as
`readonly' so that any filesystem consistency check programs
(fsck) can safely assume that there are no half-written
files in progress while performing the check. No programs
or processes can write to files on the filesystem in
question until it is `remounted' as read/write capable.
<P>This is one of the few kernel boot arguments that has its
default stored in the kernel image, and which can thus
be altered with the <CODE>rdev</CODE> utility.
<P>
<H3>The `rw' Argument</H3>

<P>This is the exact opposite of the above, in that it tells the
kernel to mount the root filesystem as read/write. The default
is to mount the root filesystem as read/write anyway. Do not
run any `fsck' type programs on a filesystem that is mounted
read/write.
<P>The same value stored in the image file mentioned above is
also used for this parameter, accessible via <CODE>rdev</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Options Relating to RAM Disk Management</A>
</H2>

<P>The following options all relate to how the kernel handles
the RAM disk device, which is usually used for bootstrapping
machines during the install phase, or for machines with
modular drivers that need to be installed to access the
root filesystem.
<P>
<P>
<H3>The `ramdisk_start=' Argument</H3>

<P>To allow a kernel image to reside on a floppy disk along with a
compressed ramdisk image, the `ramdisk_start=&lt;offset&gt;' command
was added. The kernel can't be included into the compressed ramdisk
filesystem image, because it needs to be stored starting at block
zero so that the BIOS can load the bootsector and then the kernel
can bootstrap itself to get going.
<P>Note: If you are using an uncompressed ramdisk image, then the kernel
can be a part of the filesystem image that is being loaded into the
ramdisk, and the floppy can be booted with LILO, or the two can be
separate as is done for the compressed images.
<P>If you are using a two-disk boot/root setup (kernel on disk 1,
ramdisk image on disk 2) then the ramdisk would start at block zero,
and an offset of zero would be used. Since this is the default value,
you would not need to actually use the command at all.
<P>
<H3>The `load_ramdisk=' Argument</H3>

<P>This parameter tells the kernel whether it is to try to load a
ramdisk image or not. Specifying `load_ramdisk=1' will tell the
kernel to load a floppy into the ramdisk. The default value is
zero, meaning that the kernel should not try to load a ramdisk.
<P>Please see the file <CODE>linux/Documentation/ramdisk.txt</CODE>
for a complete description of the new boot time arguments, and
how to use them. A description of how this parameter can be set
and stored in the kernel image via `rdev' is also described.
<P>
<H3>The `prompt_ramdisk=' Argument</H3>

<P>This parameter tells the kernel whether or not to give you a prompt
asking you to insert the floppy containing the ramdisk image. In
a single floppy configuration the ramdisk image is on the same floppy
as the kernel that just finished loading/booting and so a prompt
is not needed. In this case one can use `prompt_ramdisk=0'. In a
two floppy configuration, you will need the chance to switch disks,
and thus `prompt_ramdisk=1' can be used. Since this is the default
value, it doesn't really need to be specified. (
(Historical note: Sneaky people used to use the `vga=ask' LILO
option to temporarily pause the boot process and allow a chance to 
switch from boot to root floppy.)
<P>Please see the file <CODE>linux/Documentation/ramdisk.txt</CODE>
for a complete description of the new boot time arguments, and
how to use them. A description of how this parameter can be set
and stored in the kernel image via `rdev' is also described.
<P>
<H3>The `ramdisk_size=' Argument</H3>

<P>While it is true that the ramdisk grows dynamically as required,
there is an upper bound on its size so that it doesn't consume
all available RAM and leave you in a mess. The default is 4096
(i.e. 4MB) which should be large enough for most needs. You
can override the default to a bigger or smaller size with this
boot argument.
<P>Please see the file <CODE>linux/Documentation/ramdisk.txt</CODE>
for a complete description of the new boot time arguments, and
how to use them. A description of how this parameter can be set
and stored in the kernel image via `rdev' is also described.
<P>
<H3>The `ramdisk=' Argument (obsolete)</H3>

<P>(NOTE: This argument is obsolete, and should not be used except
on kernels v1.3.47 and older. The commands that should be used
for the ramdisk device are documented above.)
<P>This specifies the size in kB of the RAM disk device.
For example, if one wished to have a root filesystem on a 1.44MB
floppy loaded into the RAM disk device, they would use:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        ramdisk=1440
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>This is one of the few kernel boot arguments that has its
default stored in the kernel image, and which can thus
be altered with the <CODE>rdev</CODE> utility.
<P>
<P>
<H3>The `noinitrd' (initial RAM disk) Argument</H3>

<P>The v2.x and newer kernels have a feature where the root filesystem
can be initially a RAM disk, and the kernel executes <CODE>/linuxrc</CODE>
on that RAM image. This feature is typically used to allow loading
of modules needed to mount the real root filesystem (e.g. load
the SCSI driver modules stored in the RAM disk image, and then
mount the real root filesystem on a SCSI disk.)
<P>The actual `noinitrd' argument determines what happens to the
initrd data after the kernel has booted.  When
specified, instead of converting it to a RAM disk, it
is accessible via <CODE>/dev/initrd</CODE>, which can be read once
before the RAM is released back to the system. For full details
on using the initial RAM disk, please consult
<CODE>linux/Documentation/initrd.txt</CODE>. In addition, the most
recent versions of <CODE>LILO</CODE> and <CODE>LOADLIN</CODE> should have additional
useful information.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Boot Arguments Related to Memory Handling</A>
</H2>

<P>The following arguments alter how Linux detects or handles
the physical and virtual memory of your system.
<P>
<H3>The `mem=' Argument</H3>

<P>This argument has two purposes: The original purpose was to
specify the amount of installed memory (or a value less than
that if you wanted to limit the amount of memory available to
linux). The second (and hardly used) purpose is to specify
<CODE>mem=nopentium</CODE> which tells the Linux kernel to not use
the 4MB page table performance feature.
<P>The original BIOS call defined in the PC specification  that
returns the amount of installed memory was only designed to
be able to report up to 64MB. (Yes, another lack of foresight,
just like the 1024 cylinder disks... sigh.) Linux uses this
BIOS call at boot to determine how much memory is installed.
If you have more than 64MB of RAM installed, you can use this
boot argument to tell Linux how much memory you have.
Here is a quote from Linus on the usage of the <CODE>mem=</CODE> parameter.
<P>``The kernel will accept any `mem=xx' parameter you give it, and if
it turns out that you lied to it, it will crash horribly sooner or
later.  The parameter indicates the highest addressable RAM address,
so `mem=0x1000000' means you have 16MB of memory, for example.  For
a 96MB machine this would be `mem=0x6000000'.
If you tell Linux that it has more memory
than it actually does have, bad things will happen: maybe not at
once, but surely eventually.''
<P>Note that the argument does not have to be in hex, and the
suffixes `k' and `M' (case insensitive) can be used to specify
kilobytes and Megabytes, respectively. (A `k' will cause a 10 bit
shift on your value, and a `M' will cause a 20 bit shift.)
A typical example for a 128MB machine would be "<CODE>mem=128m</CODE>".
<P>
<H3>The `swap=' Argument</H3>

<P>This allows the user to tune some of the virtual memory (VM)
parameters that are related to swapping to disk. It accepts
the following eight parameters:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        MAX_PAGE_AGE
        PAGE_ADVANCE
        PAGE_DECLINE
        PAGE_INITIAL_AGE
        AGE_CLUSTER_FRACT
        AGE_CLUSTER_MIN
        PAGEOUT_WEIGHT
        BUFFEROUT_WEIGHT
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Interested hackers are advised to have a read of 
<CODE>linux/mm/swap.c</CODE> and also make note of the goodies in 
<CODE>/proc/sys/vm</CODE>. Kernels come with some
useful documentation on this in the
<CODE>linux/Documentation/vm/</CODE> directory.
<P>
<H3>The `buff=' Argument</H3>

<P>Similar to the `swap=' argument, this allows the user to
tune some of the parameters related to buffer memory management.
It accepts the following six parameters:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        MAX_BUFF_AGE
        BUFF_ADVANCE
        BUFF_DECLINE
        BUFF_INITIAL_AGE
        BUFFEROUT_WEIGHT
        BUFFERMEM_GRACE
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Interested hackers are advised to have a read of 
<CODE>linux/mm/swap.c</CODE> and also make note of the goodies
in <CODE>/proc/sys/vm</CODE>.  Kernels come with some
useful documentation on this in the
<CODE>linux/Documentation/vm/</CODE> directory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Boot Arguments for NFS Root Filesystem</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux supports systems such as diskless workstations via
having their root filesystem as NFS (Network FileSystem).
These arguments are used to tell the diskless workstation
which machine it is to get its system from. Also note that
the argument <CODE>root=/dev/nfs</CODE> is required. Detailed
information on using an NFS root fs is in the file
<CODE>linux/Documentation/nfsroot.txt</CODE>. You should read
that file, as the following is only a quick summary taken
directly from that file.
<P>
<H3>The `nfsroot=' Argument</H3>

<P>This argument tells the kernel which machine, what directory
and what NFS options to use for the root filesystem. The form
of the argument is as follows:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        nfsroot=[&lt;server-ip>:]&lt;root-dir>[,&lt;nfs-options>]
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>If the nfsroot parameter is not given on the command line, the default
`/tftpboot/%s' will be used. The other options are as follows:
<P>&lt;server-ip&gt; --
Specifies the IP address of the NFS server. If this field
is not given, the default address as determined by the
nfsaddrs variable (see below) is used. One use of this
parameter is for example to allow using different servers
for RARP and NFS. Usually you can leave this blank.
<P>&lt;root-dir&gt; --
Name of the directory on the server to mount as root. If
there is a `%s' token in the string, the token will be
replaced by the ASCII-representation of the client's IP
address.
<P>&lt;nfs-options&gt; --
Standard NFS options. All options are separated by commas.
If the options field is not given, the following defaults
will be used:
<P>
<PRE>
        port            = as given by server portmap daemon
        rsize           = 1024
        wsize           = 1024
        timeo           = 7
        retrans         = 3
        acregmin        = 3
        acregmax        = 60
        acdirmin        = 30
        acdirmax        = 60
        flags           = hard, nointr, noposix, cto, ac
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>The `nfsaddrs=' Argument</H3>

<P>This boot argument sets up the various network interface addresses
that are required to communicate over the network. If this argument
is not given, then the kernel tries to use RARP and/or BOOTP to
figure out these parameters. The form is as follows:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        nfsaddrs=&lt;my-ip>:&lt;serv-ip>:&lt;gw-ip>:&lt;netmask>:&lt;name>:&lt;dev>:&lt;auto>
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>&lt;my-ip&gt; --
IP address of the client. If empty, the address will either
be determined by RARP or BOOTP. What protocol is used de-
pends on what has been enabled during kernel configuration
and on the &lt;auto&gt; parameter. If this parameter is not
empty, neither RARP nor BOOTP will be used.
<P>&lt;serv-ip&gt; --
IP address of the NFS server. If RARP is used to determine
the client address and this parameter is NOT empty only
replies from the specified server are accepted. To use
different RARP and NFS server, specify your RARP server
here (or leave it blank), and specify your NFS server in
the nfsroot parameter (see above). If this entry is blank
the address of the server is used which answered the RARP
or BOOTP request.
<P>&lt;gw-ip&gt; --
IP address of a gateway if the server in on a different
subnet. If this entry is empty no gateway is used and the
server is assumed to be on the local network, unless a
value has been received by BOOTP.
<P>&lt;netmask&gt; --
Netmask for local network interface. If this is empty,
the netmask is derived from the client IP address,
unless a value has been received by BOOTP.
<P>&lt;name&gt; --
Name of the client. If empty, the client IP address is
used in ASCII-notation, or the value received by BOOTP.
<P>&lt;dev&gt; --
Name of network device to use. If this is empty, all
devices are used for RARP requests, and the first one
found for BOOTP. For NFS the device is used on which
either RARP or BOOTP replies have been received. If
you only have one device you can safely leave this blank.
<P>&lt;auto&gt; --
Method to use for autoconfiguration. If this is either
`rarp' or `bootp' the specified protocol is being used.
If the value is `both' or empty, both protocols are used
so far as they have been enabled during kernel configuration
Using 'none' means no autoconfiguration. In this case you
have to specify all necessary values in the fields before.
<P>The &lt;auto&gt; parameter can appear alone as the value to the
nfsaddrs parameter (without all the `:' characters before) in which
case autoconfiguration is used. However, the `none' value is not
available in that case.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Other Misc. Kernel Boot Arguments</A>
</H2>

<P>These various boot arguments let the user tune certain
internal kernel parameters.
<P>
<H3>The `debug' Argument</H3>

<P>The kernel communicates important (and not-so important)
messages to the operator via the <CODE>printk()</CODE> function.
If the message is considered important, the <CODE>printk()</CODE>
function will put a copy on the present console as well
as handing it off to the <CODE>klogd()</CODE> facility so that it
gets logged to disk. The reason for printing important
messages to the console as well as logging them to disk is
because under unfortunate circumstances (e.g. a disk failure)
the message won't make it to disk and will be lost.
<P>The threshold for what is and what isn't considered important
is set by the <CODE>console_loglevel</CODE> variable. The default is
to log anything more important than <CODE>DEBUG</CODE> (level 7) to
the console. (These levels are defined in the include file
<CODE>kernel.h</CODE>) Specifying <CODE>debug</CODE> as a boot argument will
set the console loglevel to 10, so that <EM>all</EM> kernel
messages appear on the console.
<P>The console loglevel can usually also be set at run time via
an option to the <CODE>klogd()</CODE> program. Check the man page
for the version installed on your system to see how to do this.
<P>
<H3>The `init=' Argument</H3>

<P>The kernel defaults to starting the `init' program at boot,
which then takes care of setting up the computer for users
via launching getty programs, running `rc' scripts and the like.
The kernel first looks for <CODE>/sbin/init</CODE>, then
<CODE>/etc/init</CODE> (depreciated), and as a last resort, it
will try to use <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE> (possibly on <CODE>/etc/rc</CODE>).
If for example, your init program got corrupted and thus stopped
you from being able to boot, you could simply use the boot prompt
<CODE>init=/bin/sh</CODE> which would drop you directly into a
shell at boot, allowing you to replace the corrupted program.
<P>
<H3>The `kbd-reset' Argument</H3>

<P>Normally on i386 based machines, the Linux kernel does not 
reset the keyboard controller at boot, since the BIOS is
supposed to do this.  But as usual, not all machines do what
they should. Supplying this option may help if you are having 
problems with your keyboard behaviour.  It simply forces a
reset at initialization time. (Some have argued that this should
be the default behaviour anyways).
<P>
<H3>The `maxcpus=' Argument</H3>

<P>The number given with this argument limits the maximum
number of CPUs activated in SMP mode.  Using a value of
0 is equivalent to the <CODE>nosmp</CODE> option.
<P>
<H3>The `mca-pentium' Argument</H3>

<P>The IBM model 95 Microchannel machines seem to lock up on the 
test that Linux usually does to detect the type of math chip
coupling.  Since all Pentium chips have a built in math processor,
this test (and the lock up problem) can be avoided by using
this boot option.
<P>
<H3>The `md=' Argument</H3>

<P>If your root filesystem is on a Multiple Device then you can
use this (assuming you compiled in boot support) to tell the
kernel the  multiple device layout. The format (from the 
file <CODE>linux/Documentation/md.txt</CODE>) is:
<P><CODE>md=md_device_num,raid_level,chunk_size_factor,fault_level,dev0,dev1,...,devN</CODE>
<P>Where <CODE>md_device_num</CODE> is the number of the md device,
i.e. 0 means md0, 1 means md1, etc.
For <CODE>raid_level</CODE>, use -1 for linear mode and 0 for striped mode.
Other modes are currently unsupported.
The <CODE>chunk_size_factor</CODE> is for  raid-0 and raid-1 only and
sets the chunk size as PAGE_SIZE shifted left the specified 
amount.  The <CODE>fault_level</CODE> is only for raid-1
and sets the maximum fault number to the specified number.
(Currently unsupported due to lack of boot support for raid1.)
The <CODE>dev0-devN</CODE> are a commaseparated list of the devices that
make up the individual md device: 
e.g. <CODE>/dev/hda1,/dev/hdc1,/dev/sda1</CODE>
<P>
<H3>The `no387' Argument</H3>

<P>Some i387 coprocessor chips have bugs that show up when
used in 32 bit protected mode. For example, some of the
early ULSI-387 chips would cause solid lockups while
performing floating point calculations, apparently due to
a bug in the FRSAV/FRRESTOR instructions.  Using the `no387'
boot argument causes Linux to ignore the math coprocessor
even if you have one. Of course you must then have your
kernel compiled with math emulation support! This may also
be useful if you have one of those <EM>really</EM> old 386 machines
that could use an 80287 FPU, as Linux can't use an 80287.
<P>
<H3>The `no-hlt' Argument</H3>

<P>The i386 (and successors thereof) family of CPUs have a
`hlt' instruction which tells the CPU that nothing is
going to happen until an external device (keyboard, modem,
disk, etc.) calls upon the CPU to do a task. This allows the
CPU to enter a `low-power' mode where it sits like a zombie
until an external device wakes it up (usually via an interrupt).
Some of the early i486DX-100 chips had a problem  with the
`hlt' instruction, in that they couldn't reliably return to
operating mode after this instruction was used. Using the
`no-hlt' instruction tells Linux to just run an infinite loop
when there is nothing else to do, and to <EM>not</EM> halt your
CPU when there is no activity. This allows people with these
broken chips to use Linux, although they would be well advised
to seek a replacement through a warranty where possible.
<P>
<H3>The `no-scroll' Argument</H3>

<P>Using this argument at boot disables scrolling features that
make it difficult to use Braille terminals.
<P>
<H3>The `noapic' Argument</H3>

<P>Using this option tells a SMP kernel to not use some of the
advanced features of the interrupt controller on multi processor
machines. See <CODE>linux/Documentation/IO-APIC.txt</CODE> for more
information.
<P>
<H3>The `nosmp' Argument</H3>

<P>Use of this option will tell a SMP kernel on a SMP machine to
operate single processor.  Typically only used for debugging
and determining if a particular problem is SMP related.
<P>
<H3>The `panic=' Argument</H3>

<P>In the unlikely event of a kernel panic (i.e. an internal error
that has been detected by the kernel, and which the kernel decides
is serious enough to moan loudly and then halt everything), the
default behaviour is to just sit there until someone comes along
and notices the panic message on the screen and reboots the machine.
However if a machine is running unattended in an isolated location
it may be desirable for it to automatically reset itself so that
the machine comes back on line. For example, using <CODE>panic=30</CODE> at
boot would cause the kernel to try and reboot itself 30 seconds
after the kernel panic happened. A value of zero gives the default
behaviour, which is to wait forever.
<P>Note that this timeout value can also be read and set via the
<CODE>/proc/sys/kernel/panic</CODE> sysctl interface.
<P>
<H3>The `pci=' Argument</H3>

<P>
<P>
<H3>The `pirq=' Argument</H3>

<P>Using this option tells a SMP kernel information on the PCI
slot versus IRQ settings for SMP motherboards which are
unknown (or known to be blacklisted).
See <CODE>linux/Documentation/IO-APIC.txt</CODE> for more
information.
<P>
<H3>The `profile=' Argument</H3>

<P>Kernel developers can enable an option that allows them to
profile how and where the kernel is spending its CPU cycles
in an effort to maximize efficiency and performance. This
option lets you set the profile shift count at boot. Typically
it is set to two. You can also compile your kernel with profiling 
enabled by default. In either case, you need a tool such as 
<CODE>readprofile.c</CODE> that can make use of the <CODE>/proc/profile</CODE>
output.
<P>
<H3>The `reboot=' Argument</H3>

<P>This option controls the type of reboot that Linux will do
when it resets the computer (typically via <CODE>/sbin/init</CODE>
handling a Control-Alt-Delete). The default as of v2.0
kernels is to do a `cold' reboot (i.e. full reset, BIOS does
memory check, etc.) instead of a `warm' reboot (i.e. no full
reset, no memory check). It was changed to be cold by default 
since that tends to work on cheap/broken hardware that fails
to reboot when a warm reboot is requested. To get the old 
behaviour (i.e. warm reboots) use <CODE>reboot=w</CODE> or in fact
any word that starts with <CODE>w</CODE> will work.
<P>Why would you bother? Some disk controllers with cache memory
on board can sense a warm reboot, and flush any cached data
to disk. Upon a cold boot, the card may be reset and the 
write-back data in your cache card's memory is lost. Others have
reported systems that take a long time to go through the 
memory check, and/or SCSI BIOSes that take longer to initialize
on a cold boot as a good reason to use warm reboots.
<P>
<H3>The `reserve=' Argument</H3>

<P>This is used to <EM>protect</EM> I/O port regions from probes.
The form of the command is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
reserve=iobase,extent[,iobase,extent]...

<P>In some machines it may be necessary to prevent device drivers from
checking for devices (auto-probing) in a specific region. This may be
because of poorly designed hardware that causes the boot to <EM>freeze</EM>
(such as some ethercards), hardware that is mistakenly identified,
hardware whose state is changed by an earlier probe, or merely
hardware you don't want the kernel to initialize.
<P>The <CODE>reserve</CODE> boot-time argument addresses this problem by specifying
an I/O port region that shouldn't be probed. That region is reserved
in the kernel's port registration table as if a device has already
been found in that region (with the name <CODE>reserved</CODE>). 
Note that this mechanism shouldn't be necessary on most machines. 
Only when there is a problem or special case would it be necessary 
to use this.
<P>The I/O ports in the specified region are protected against
device probes that do a <CODE>check_region()</CODE> prior to probing
blindly into a region of I/O space. This was put in to be used 
when some driver was hanging on a NE2000, or misidentifying 
some other device as its own.  A correct device driver shouldn't 
probe a reserved region, unless another boot argument explicitly 
specifies that it do so.  This implies that <CODE>reserve</CODE> will 
most often be used with some other boot argument. Hence if you 
specify a <CODE>reserve</CODE> region to protect a specific device, you 
must generally specify an explicit probe for that device. Most 
drivers ignore the port registration table if they are given an 
explicit address.
<P>For example, the boot line
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        reserve=0x300,32  blah=0x300
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>keeps all device drivers except the driver for `blah' from
probing <CODE>0x300-0x31f</CODE>.
<P>As usual with boot-time specifiers there is an 11 parameter limit,
thus you can only specify 5 reserved regions per <CODE>reserve</CODE> keyword.
Multiple <CODE>reserve</CODE> specifiers will work if you have an unusually
complicated request.

<H3>The `vga=' Argument</H3>

<P>Note that this is not really a boot argument. It is an option
that is interpreted by LILO and not by the kernel like all the
other boot arguments are. However its use has become so common
that it deserves a mention here. It can also be set via using
<CODE>rdev -v</CODE> or equivalently <CODE>vidmode</CODE> on the vmlinuz file.
This allows the setup code to use the video BIOS to change
the default display mode before actually booting the Linux
kernel. Typical modes are 80x50, 132x44 and so on. The best
way to use this option is to start with <CODE>vga=ask</CODE> which
will prompt you with a list of various modes that you can use
with your video adapter before booting the kernel. Once you
have the number from the above list that you want to use, you
can later put it in place of the `ask'. For more information,
please see the file <CODE>linux/Documentation/svga.txt</CODE>
that comes with all recent kernel versions.
<P>Note that newer kernels (v2.1 and up) have the setup code that 
changes the video mode as an option, listed as
<CODE>Video mode selection support</CODE> so you need to enable this
option if you want to use this feature.
