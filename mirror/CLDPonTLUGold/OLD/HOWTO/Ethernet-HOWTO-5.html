<H2><A NAME="cable"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. Cables, Coax, Twisted Pair</A></H2>

<P>If you are starting a network from scratch, you will have to decide
whether to use thin ethernet (RG58 co-ax cable with BNC connectors)
or 10baseT (twisted pair telco-style cables with RJ-45 eight wire `phone'
connectors).
The old-fashioned thick ethernet, RG-5 cable with N connectors is
obsolete and rarely seen anymore.
<P>See 
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO-1.html#cable-intro">Type of cable...</A> for
an introductory look at cables.
Also note that the FAQ from <EM>comp.dcom.lans.ethernet</EM> has a lot
of useful information on cables and such. FTP to
rtfm.mit.edu and look in <CODE>/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/</CODE>
for the FAQ for that newsgroup.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="bnc"></A> <A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Thin Ethernet (thinnet)</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Thin ethernet cable is pretty inexpensive. If
you are making your own cables solid-core RG58A is $0.27/m. and
stranded RG58AU is $0.45/m. Twist-on BNC
connectors are &lt; $2 ea.,
and other misc. pieces are similarly inexpensive. It is essential
that you properly terminate each end of the cable with 50 ohm
terminators, so budget $2 ea. for a pair. It's also vital that
your cable have no `stubs' -- the `T' connectors must be attached
directly to the ethercards.
<P>There are two main drawbacks to using thinnet. The first is that it
is limited to 10Mb/sec - 100Mb/sec requires twisted pair. The second
drawback is that if you have
a big loop of machines connected together, and some bonehead breaks
the loop by taking one cable off the side of his tee, the whole
network goes down because it sees an infinite impedance (open
circuit) instead of the required 50 ohm termination. Note that
you can remove the tee piece from the card itself without killing
the whole subnet, as long as you don't remove the cables from the
tee itself. Of course this will disturb the machine that you
pull the actual tee off of. 8-) And if you are doing a small
network of two machines, you <EM>still</EM> need the tees and the 50 ohm
terminators -- you <EM>can't</EM> just cable them together!
<P>
<P>There are also some fancy cable systems which <EM>look like</EM>
a single lead going to the card, but the lead is actually
two runs of cable
laying side-by-side covered by an outer sheath, giving the
lead an oval shaped cross-section. At the turnaround point
of the loop, a BNC connector is spliced in which connects to
your card. So you have the equivalent of two runs of cable and
a BNC T, but in this case, it is impossible for the user to
remove a cable from one side of the T and disturb the network.

<H2><A NAME="utp"></A> <A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Twisted Pair</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Twisted pair networks require active hubs,
which start around $50, and the raw cable cost can
actually be higher than thinnet.  You can pretty much ignore
claims that you can use your existing telephone
wiring as it is a rare installation where that turns out to be the
case.
<P>On the other hand, all 100Mb/sec
ethernet proposals use twisted pair, and most new business
installations use twisted pair.
Also, Russ Nelson adds that `New installations should use Category 5
wiring. Anything else is a waste of your installer's time, as
100Base-whatever is going to require Cat 5.'
<P>If you are only connecting two machines, it is possible to avoid
using a hub, by swapping the Rx and Tx pairs (1-2 and 3-6).
<P>If you hold the RJ-45 connector facing you (as if you were
going to plug it into your mouth) with the lock tab on the top,
then the pins are numbered 1 to 8 from left to right. The pin
usage is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
        Pin Number              Assignment
        ----------              ----------
        1                       Output Data (+)
        2                       Output Data (-)
        3                       Input Data (+)
        4                       Reserved for Telephone use
        5                       Reserved for Telephone use
        6                       Input Data (-)
        7                       Reserved for Telephone use
        8                       Reserved for Telephone use
</PRE>
<P>If you want to make a cable, the following should spell it
out for you.  Differential signal pairs must be on the same
twisted pair to get the required minimal impedance/loss of a UTP cable.
If you look at the above table, you will see that 1+2 and 3+6 are
the two sets of differential signal pairs. Not 1+3 and 2+6 !!!!!!
At 10MHz, with short lengths, you *may* get away with such errors,
if it is only over a short length. Don't even think about it at 100MHz.
<P>For a normal patch cord, with ends `A' and `B', you want straight
through pin-to-pin mapping, with the input and output each using a
pair of twisted wires (for impedance issues). That means 1A goes to 1B,
2A goes to 2B, 3A goes to 3B and 6A goes to 6B. The wires joining
1A-1B and 2A-2B must be a twisted pair. Also the wires joining 3A-3B
and 6A-6B must be another twisted pair.
<P>Now if you don't have a hub, and want to make a `null cable', what you
want to do is make the input of `A' be the output of `B' and the
output of `A' be the input of `B', without changing the polarity.
Tha means connecting 1A to 3B (out+ A to in+ B) and 2A to 6B
(out- A to in- B). These two wires must be a twisted pair. They carry
what card/plug `A' considers output, and what is seen as input
for card/plug `B'. Then connect 3A to 1B (in+ A to out+ B) and also
connect 6A to 2B (in- A to out- B). These second two must also be
a twisted pair. They carry what card/plug `A' considers input, and
what card/plug `B' considers output.
<P>So, if you consider a normal patch cord, chop one end off of it,
swap the places of the Rx and Tx twisted pairs into the new plug,
and crimp it down, you then have a `null' cable. Nothing complicated.
You just want to feed the Tx signal of one card into the Rx of the
second and vice versa.
<P>Note that before 10BaseT was ratified as a standard, there
existed  other network formats using RJ-45
connectors, and the same wiring scheme as above. Examples
are SynOptics's LattisNet, and AT&amp;T's StarLAN.
In some cases, (as with early 3C503 cards) you could set jumpers
to get the card to talk to hubs of different types, but in most cases
cards designed for these older types of networks will not work with
standard 10BaseT networks/hubs. (Note that if the cards also have
an AUI port, then there is no reason as to why you can't use that,
combined with an AUI to 10BaseT transceiver.)

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Thick Ethernet</A>
</H2>

<P>Thick ethernet is mostly obsolete, and is usually used only to remain
compatible with an existing implementation. You can stretch the rules
and connect short spans of thick and thin ethernet together with a
passive $3 N-to-BNC connector, and that's often the best
solution to expanding an existing thicknet. A correct (but expensive)
solution is to use a repeater in this case.
