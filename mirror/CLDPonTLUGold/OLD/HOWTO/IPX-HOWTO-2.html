<P>I do not and cannot know everything there is to know about the Linux network
software. Please accept and be warned that this document probably does contain
errors. Please read any README files that are included with any of the various
pieces of software described in this document for more detailed and accurate
information. I will attempt to keep this document as error-free and up-to-date
as possible. Versions of software are current as at time of writing.
<P>In no way do I or the authors of the software in this document offer protection
against your own actions. If you configure this software, even as described in
this document and it causes problems on your network then you alone must
carry the responsibility. I include this warning because IPX network design
and configuration is not always a simple matter and sometimes undesirable
interaction with other routers and fileservers can result if you do not design
or configure your network carefully. I also include this warning because I
was asked to by someone unfortunate enough to have discovered this lesson the
hard way.
<P>
