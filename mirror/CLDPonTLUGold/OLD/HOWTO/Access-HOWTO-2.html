<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Comparing Linux with other Operating Systems</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 General Comparison</A>
</H2>

<P>The best place to find out about this is in such documents as the
`Linux Info Sheet', `Linux Meta FAQ' and `Linux FAQ' (see 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-7.html#linux-docs">Linux Documentation</A>).  Major reasons for a
visually impaired person to use Linux would include it's inbuilt
networking which gives full access to the Internet.  More generally,
users are attracted by the full development environment included.
Also, unlike most other modern GUI environments, the graphical front
end to Linux (X Windows) is clearly separated from the underlying
environment and there is a complete set of modern programs such as
World Wide Web browsers and fax software which work directly in the
non graphical environment.  This opens up the way to provide
alternative access paths to the systems functionality; Emacspeak is a
good example.
<P>For other users, the comparison is probably less favourable and less
clear.  People with very specific and complex needs will find that the
full development system included allows properly customised solutions.
However, much of the software which exists on other systems is only
just beginning to become available.  More development is being done
however in almost all directions.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Availability of Adaptive Technology</A>
</H2>

<P>There is almost nothing commercial available <EM>specifically</EM> for
Linux.  There is a noticeable amount of free software which would be
helpful in adaptation, for example, a free speech synthesiser and some
free voice control software.  There are also a number of free packages
which provide good support for certain Braille terminals, for example.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Inherent Usability</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux has the vast advantage over Windows that most of it's
software is command line oriented.  This is now changing and almost
everything is now available with a graphical front end.  However,
because it is in origin a programmers operating system, line oriented
programs are still being written covering almost all new areas of
interest.  For the physically disabled, this means that it is easy
to build custom programs to suit their needs.  For the visually
impaired, this should make use with a speech synthesiser or Braille
terminal easy and useful for the foreseeable future.
<P>
<P>Linux's multiple virtual consoles system make it practical to use
as a multi-tasking operating system by a visually impaired person
working directly through Braille.
<P>
<P>The windowing system used by Linux (X11) comes with many
programming tools, and should be adaptable.  However, in practice, the
adaptive programs available up till now have been more primitive than
those on the Macintosh or Windows.  They are, however, completely free
(as opposed to hundreds of pounds) and the quality is definitely
improving.
<P>
<P>In principle it should be possible to put together a complete,
usable Linux system for a visually impaired person for about
$500 (cheap &amp; nasty PC + sound card).  This compares with
many thousands of dollars for other operating systems (screen reader
software/ speech synthesiser hardware).  I have yet to see this.  I
doubt it would work in practice because the software speech
synthesisers available for Linux aren't yet sufficiently good.  For a
physically disabled person, the limitation will still be the
expense of input hardware.
