<P>
<P>The RPM package format is already very well documented, particularly
in the book <EM>Maximum RPM</EM> by Ed Bailey, which you can download
from the 
<A HREF="http://www.rpm.org/">RPM WWW site</A> - also
available from all good book stores!  This is just a couple of quick
hints for people in a hurry.
<P>
<P>RPM packages are built from a <EM>spec</EM> file.  This consists (in a
similar fashion to the KickStart config file) of a recipe of steps
that need to be taken in order to build the package - it's expected
that you'll have to build it from source, potentially for multiple
platforms, and may need to apply patches before compiling.  Once built
and installed, a binary RPM will be created from the files and
directories you specify as being associated with the package.  It's
important to note that RPM has no idea of which files and directories
are related to a given package - you have to tell it.
<P>Here's a sample specification for a custom RPM of the 
<A HREF="http://squid.nlanr.net/">Squid WWW cache server</A>:

Summary: Squid Web Cache server
Name: squid
Version: 1.NOVM.22
Release: 1
Copyright: GPL/Harvest
Group: Networking/Daemons
Source: squid-1.NOVM.22-src.tar.gz
Patch: retry-1.NOVM.20.patch
%description
This is just a first attempt to package up the Squid Web Cache for easy
installation on our RedHat Linux servers

%prep
%setup
%build
configure --prefix=/usr/squid
perl -spi -e 's!#( -DALLOW_HOSTNAME_UNDERSCORES)!$1!' src/Makefile
make

%install
make install

%files
/usr/squid
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Here's how to build this RPM:
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% mkdir -p SOURCES BUILD SRPMS RPMS/i386
% cp ~/squid-1.NOVM.22-src.tar.gz SOURCES
% cp ~/retry-1.NOVM.20.patch SOURCES
% rpm -ba squid-1.NOVM.22+retry-1.spec
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This will automatically create a subdirectory under the <EM>BUILD</EM>
directory, into which it'll unpack the source code and then apply the
patch (there are a number of options available for patching - check
the book for details).  Now, RPM will automatically build the package
by running <CODE>configure</CODE> and then <CODE>make</CODE>, install it using
<CODE>make install</CODE>, and take a snapshot of the files under
<EM>/usr/squid</EM>.  It's the latter which will form the binary RPM
of the Squid software.
<P>
<P>Note that we can insert arbitrary shell commands into the unpacking,
building and installing processes, e.g. the call to <CODE>perl</CODE>
which tweaks one of Squid's compile-time parameters.
<P>
<P>The final binary RPM will be left under the <EM>RPMS</EM> directory in
the platform specific subdirectory <EM>i386</EM>.  In this case it
will be called <EM>squid-1.NOVM.22-1.i386.rpm</EM>.  Note that the
filename is created by concatenating the values of the following
parameters from the spec file: <CODE>Name</CODE>, <CODE>Version</CODE> and
<CODE>Release</CODE> - plus the hardware platform in question,
<EM>i386</EM> in this case.  Try to bear this in mind when creating
your own RPMs, to avoid giving them overly long or painful names!
<P>
<P>It's also worth bearing in mind that you can build RPMs without having
to rebuild the whole software package, e.g.

Summary: Linux 2.0.36 kernel + filehandle patch + serial console patch
Name: linux
Version: 2.0.36+filehandle+serial_console
Release: 1
Copyright: GPL
Group: Base/Kernel
Source: linux-2.0.36+filehandle+serial_console.tar.gz

This is just a first attempt to package up the Linux kernel with patches
for installation on our RedHat Linux servers

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>In this case we simply create an RPM based on the
<EM>/boot/vmlinuz</EM> file and the contents of the directory
<EM>/lib/modules/2.0.36</EM>, and execute <EM>/sbin/lilo</EM> after
the package has been installed on a target machine.  Let me know if
you know much neater way of writing the spec file than this.
