<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Important note on obsolete information</A></H2>

<P>I've just discovered that some of the documentation below is obsolete.
In particular, the <CODE>init</CODE> daemon that comes with
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/daemons/init/sysvinit-2.64.tar.gz">the latest sysvinit package</A>
is more sophisticated than I've portrayed it to be.  Although it seems
that the current version is backward compatible with what's written
here, it looks like it has some undocumented features which are
<B>very important</B> for UPS support.
<P>The control mechanism outlined below only allows <CODE>powerd</CODE> to give
<CODE>init</CODE> one of two messages, namely <CODE>powerfail</CODE> or <CODE>powerok</CODE>.
<CODE>init</CODE> runs one command when it receives <CODE>powerfail</CODE>, and another
when it receives <CODE>powerok</CODE>.  This leads to complicated <CODE>powerd</CODE>
logic for dealing with low battery signals and other sorts of special
situations.
<P>Newer versions of <CODE>init</CODE> (as of version 2.58, it seems) are more
sophisticated.  These versions can be signaled to run one of
<CODE>three</CODE> scripts.  Thus, <CODE>init</CODE> can have a <CODE>powerfail</CODE> script
for announcing a power outage, a <CODE>powerfailnow</CODE> script for doing an
immediate shutdown, and a <CODE>powerok</CODE> script for halting any pending
shutdowns.  This is much cleaner than the gyrations one would have to
go through with the mechanisms detailed below.
<P>Although most of the discussion here assumes the old <CODE>init</CODE>
communication method, I just added two new sections where the authors
uses the new communcation method.  These are sections 
<A HREF="UPS-HOWTO-8.html#ciro">Trust Energy Protector 400/650</A> and 
<A HREF="UPS-HOWTO-8.html#apc700">APC Smart-UPS 700</A>.  The former is especially detailed.  Both include a
<CODE>powerd.c</CODE> which signals <CODE>init</CODE> to do an immediate shutdown when
a low battery signal is received, as well as the relevant
<CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE> lines to make this work.  Other than this, all I
can tell you is to look at the source code for <CODE>init</CODE>.
<P>Also, for all I know, many of the software packages listed below also
use this newer communication method.
