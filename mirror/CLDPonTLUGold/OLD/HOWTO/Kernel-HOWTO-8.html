<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Some pitfalls </A></H2>

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 make clean </A>
</H2>

<P>If your new kernel does really weird things after a routine kernel upgrade,
chances are you forgot to <CODE>make clean</CODE> before compiling the new
kernel. Symptoms can be anything from
your system outright crashing, strange I/O problems, to crummy
performance. Make sure you do a <CODE>make dep</CODE>, too.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Huge or slow kernels </A>
</H2>

<P>If your kernel is sucking up a lot of memory, is too large,
and/or just takes forever to compile even when you've got your new
Quadbazillium-III/4400 working on it, you've probably got lots of unneeded
stuff (device drivers, filesystems, etc) configured. If you don't use it,
don't configure it, because it does take up memory.
The most obvious symptom of kernel bloat is extreme swapping in and out of
memory to disk; if your disk is making a lot of noise and it's not one of
those old Fujitsu Eagles that sound like like a jet landing when turned
off, look over your kernel configuration.
<P>
<P>You can find out how much memory the kernel is using by taking the
total amount of memory in your machine and subtracting from it the
amount of ``total mem'' in <CODE>/proc/meminfo</CODE>  or the output of the command
`<CODE>free</CODE>'.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 The parallel port doesn't work/my printer doesn't work</A>
</H2>

<P>Configuration options for PCs are: First, under the category `General Setup',
select `Parallel port support' and `PC-style hardware'. Then under
`Character devices', select `Parallel printer support'.
<P>Then there are the names. Linux 2.2 names the printer devices differently
than previous releases. The upshot of this is that if you had an <CODE>lp1</CODE>
under your old kernel, it's probably an <CODE>lp0</CODE> under your new one.
Use `<CODE>dmesg</CODE>' or look through the logs in <CODE>/var/log</CODE> to find
out.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Kernel doesn't compile </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If it does not compile, then it is likely that a patch failed, or your
source is somehow corrupt. Your version of gcc also might not
be correct, or could also be corrupt (for example, the include files
might be in error). Make sure that the symbolic links which
Linus describes in the <CODE>README</CODE> are set up correctly. In general, if
a standard kernel
does not compile, something is seriously wrong with the system, and 
reinstallation of certain tools is probably necessary.
<P>
<P>In some cases, gcc can crash due to hardware problems. The error
message will be something like ``xxx exited with signal 15'' and it will
generally look very mysterious. I probably would not mention this, except
that it happened to me once - I had some bad cache memory, and the compiler
would occasionally barf at random. Try reinstalling gcc first if you
experience problems. You should only get suspicious if your kernel compiles
fine with external cache turned off, a reduced amount of RAM, etc.
<P>
<P>It tends to disturb people when it's suggested that their hardware has
problems. Well, I'm not making this up. There is an FAQ for it -- it's at
<CODE>http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/</CODE>.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 New version of the kernel doesn't seem to boot</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You did not run LILO, or it is not configured correctly. One thing that
``got'' me once was a problem in the config file; it said `<CODE>boot =
/dev/hda1</CODE>'
instead of `<CODE>boot = /dev/hda</CODE>' (This can be really annoying at first,
but once you have a working config file, you shouldn't need to
change it.).
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 You forgot to run LILO, or system doesn't boot at all</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Ooops! The best thing you can do here is to boot off of a floppy disk or
CDROM and
prepare another bootable floppy (such as `<CODE>make zdisk</CODE>' would do).
You need to know where your root (<CODE>/</CODE>) filesystem is and what type
it is (e.g. second extended, minix). In the example below, you also need
to know what filesystem your <CODE>/usr/src/linux</CODE> source
tree is on, its type, and where it is normally mounted.
<P>
<P>In the following example, <CODE>/</CODE> is <CODE>/dev/hda1</CODE>, and the
filesystem which holds <CODE>/usr/src/linux</CODE>
is <CODE>/dev/hda3</CODE>, normally mounted at <CODE>/usr</CODE>. Both are
second extended filesystems. The working kernel image in
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot</CODE> is called <CODE>bzImage</CODE>.
<P>
<P>The idea is that if there is a functioning
<CODE>bzImage</CODE>, it is possible to use that
for the new floppy. Another alternative, which may or may not work better
(it depends on the particular method in which you messed up your system) is
discussed after the example.
<P>
<P>First, boot from a boot/root disk combo or rescue disk, and
mount the filesystem which contains the working kernel image:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
    mkdir /mnt
    mount -t ext2 /dev/hda3 /mnt
</PRE>
<P>If <CODE>mkdir</CODE> tells you that the directory already exists, just ignore
it. Now, <CODE>cd</CODE> to the place where the working kernel image was. Note
that
<PRE>
/mnt + /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot - /usr = /mnt/src/linux/arch/i386/boot
</PRE>

Place a formatted
disk in drive ``A:'' (not your boot or root disk!), dump
the image to the disk, and configure it for your root filesystem:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
    cd /mnt/src/linux/arch/i386/boot
    dd if=bzImage of=/dev/fd0
    rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/hda1
</PRE>
<P><CODE>cd</CODE> to <CODE>/</CODE> and unmount the normal <CODE>/usr</CODE> filesystem:
<P>
<PRE>
    cd /
    umount /mnt
</PRE>
<P>You should now be able to reboot your system as normal from this floppy.
Don't forget to run lilo (or whatever it was that you did wrong) after
the reboot!
<P>
<P>As mentioned above, there is another common alternative. If you
happened to have a working kernel image in <CODE>/</CODE> (<CODE>/vmlinuz</CODE>
for example), you can use that for a boot disk. Supposing all of the above
conditions, and that my kernel image is <CODE>/vmlinuz</CODE>, just make these
alterations to the example above: change
<CODE>/dev/hda3</CODE> to <CODE>/dev/hda1</CODE> (the <CODE>/</CODE> filesystem),
<CODE>/mnt/src/linux</CODE> to
<CODE>/mnt</CODE>, and <CODE>if=bzImage</CODE> to <CODE>if=vmlinuz</CODE>. The
note explaining how to derive <CODE>/mnt/src/linux</CODE> may be ignored.
<P>
<P>Using LILO with big drives (more than 1024 cylinders) can cause problems.
See the LILO mini-HOWTO or documentation for help on that.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7 It says `warning: bdflush not running' </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This can be a severe problem. Starting with a kernel release
after 1.0 (around 20 Apr 1994), a program called `<CODE>update</CODE>' which
periodically flushes out the filesystem buffers, was upgraded/replaced. Get
the sources to `<CODE>bdflush</CODE>'
(you should find it where you got your kernel source), and install it (you
probably want to run your system under the old kernel while doing this). It
installs itself as `<CODE>update</CODE>' and after a reboot, the new kernel
should no longer complain.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.8">8.8 I can't get my IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drive to work</A>
</H2>

<P>Strangely enough, lots of people cannot get their ATAPI drives working,
probably because there are a number of things that can go wrong.
<P>If your CD-ROM drive is the only device on a particular IDE
interface, it must be jumpered as ``master'' or ``single.'' Supposedly,
this is the most common error.
<P>Creative Labs (for one) has put IDE interfaces on their sound cards now.
However, this leads to the interesting problem that while some people only
have one interface to being with, many have two IDE interfaces built-in to
their motherboards (at IRQ15, usually), so a common practice is to make the
soundblaster interface a third IDE port (IRQ11, or so I'm told).
<P>This causes problems with linux in that versions 1.2.x don't support a third
IDE interface (there is support in starting somewhere in the 1.3.x series
but that's development, remember, and it doesn't auto-probe). To get around
this, you have a few choices.
<P>
<P>If you have a second IDE port already, chances are that you are not using
it or it doesn't already have two devices on it. Take the ATAPI drive off
the sound card and put it on the second interface. You can then disable the
sound card's interface, which saves an IRQ anyway.
<P>If you don't have a second interface, jumper the sound card's interface
(not the sound card's sound part) as IRQ15, the second interface. It should
work.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.9">8.9 It says weird things about obsolete routing requests </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Get new versions of the <CODE>route</CODE> program and any other programs
which do route manipulation.
<CODE>/usr/include/linux/route.h</CODE>  (which is actually a file in
<CODE>/usr/src/linux</CODE>) has changed.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.10">8.10 Firewalling not working in 1.2.0</A>
</H2>

<P>Upgrade to at least version 1.2.1.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.11">8.11 ``Not a compressed kernel Image file''</A>
</H2>

<P>Don't use the <CODE>vmlinux</CODE> file created in <CODE>/usr/src/linux</CODE> as
your boot image; <CODE>[..]/arch/i386/boot/bzImage</CODE> is the right
one.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.12">8.12 Problems with console terminal after upgrade to 1.3.x</A>
</H2>

<P>Change the word <CODE>dumb</CODE> to <CODE>linux</CODE> in the console termcap
entry in <CODE>/etc/termcap</CODE>. You may also have to make a terminfo entry.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.13">8.13 Can't seem to compile things after kernel upgrade</A>
</H2>

<P>The linux kernel source includes a number of include files (the things that
end with <CODE>.h</CODE>) which are referenced by the standard ones in
<CODE>/usr/include</CODE>. They are typically referenced like this (where
<CODE>xyzzy.h</CODE> would be something in <CODE>/usr/include/linux</CODE>):
<PRE>
    #include &lt;linux/xyzzy.h>
</PRE>

Normally, there is a link called <CODE>linux</CODE> in <CODE>/usr/include</CODE> to
the <CODE>include/linux</CODE> directory of your kernel source
(<CODE>/usr/src/linux/include/linux</CODE> in the typical system). If this link
is not there, or points to the wrong place, most things will not compile at
all. If you decided that the kernel source was taking too much room on the
disk and deleted it, this will obviously be a problem. Another way it might
go wrong is with file permissions; if your <CODE>root</CODE> has a umask
which doesn't allow other users to see its files by default, and you
extracted the kernel source without the <CODE>p</CODE> (preserve filemodes)
option, those users also won't be able to use the C compiler. Although you
could use the <CODE>chmod</CODE> command to fix this, it is probably easier to
re-extract the include files. You can do this the same way you did the
whole source at the beginning, only with an additional argument:
<P>
<PRE>
    blah# tar zxvpf linux.x.y.z.tar.gz linux/include
</PRE>

Note: ``<CODE>make config</CODE>'' will recreate the <CODE>/usr/src/linux</CODE>
link if it isn't there.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.14">8.14 Increasing limits</A>
</H2>

<P>The following few <I>example</I> commands may be helpful to those
wondering how to increase certain soft limits imposed by the kernel:
<PRE>
echo 4096 > /proc/sys/kernel/file-max
echo 12288 > /proc/sys/kernel/inode-max
echo 300 400 500 > /proc/sys/vm/freepages
</PRE>
