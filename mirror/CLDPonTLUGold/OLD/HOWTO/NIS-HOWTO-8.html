<!--ypserv!setup--><!--NIS!ypserv setup--></H2>

<P>This document only describes how to set up the "ypserv" NIS server.
<P>The NIS server software can be found on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  Site               Directory                    File Name

  ftp.kernel.org     /pub/linux/utils/net/NIS     ypserv-1.3.6.tar.gz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You could also look at
<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/~kukuk/linux/nis.html">http://www.suse.de/~kukuk/linux/nis.html</A>
for more information.
<P>The server setup is the same for both traditional NIS and NYS.
<P>Compile the software to generate the <CODE>ypserv</CODE> and <CODE>makedbm</CODE>
programs. You can configure ypserv to use the securenets file or
the tcp_wrappers. The tcp_wrapper is much more flexible, but a lot of
people have big problems with it. And some configuration files for
tcp_wrappers may cause a memory leak. If you have problems with
ypserv compiled for tcp_wrapper, recompile it using the securenets file.
ypserv --version tells you, which version you have.
<P>If you run your server as master, determine what files you require to be
available via NIS and then add or remove the appropriate
entries to the "all" rule in <CODE>/var/yp/Makefile</CODE>. You always
should look at the Makefile and edit the Options at the beginning of
the file.
<P>There was one big change between ypserv 1.1 and ypserv 1.2. Since
version 1.2, the file handles are cached. This means you have to
call makedbm always with the -c option if you create new maps. Make
sure, you are using the
new <CODE>/var/yp/Makefile</CODE> from ypserv 1.2 or later, or add the -c flag
to makedbm in the Makefile. If you don't do that, ypserv will continue to
use the old maps, and not the updated one.
<P>Now edit <CODE>/var/yp/securenets</CODE> and <CODE>/etc/ypserv.conf</CODE>.
For more information, read the ypserv(8) and ypserv.conf(5) manual pages.
<P>Make sure the portmapper (portmap(8)) is running, and start the
server <CODE>ypserv</CODE>. The command
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    % rpcinfo -u localhost ypserv
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>should output something like
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    program 100004 version 1 ready and waiting
    program 100004 version 2 ready and waiting
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The "version 1" line could be missing, depending on the ypserv version and
configuration you are using. It is only necessary if you have old
SunOS 4.x clients.
<P>Now generate the NIS (YP) database. On the master, run
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    % /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>On a slave make sure that <CODE>ypwhich -m</CODE> works. This means,
that your slave
must be configured as NIS client before you could run
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    % /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -s masterhost
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to install the host as NIS slave.
<P>
<P>That's it, your server is up and running.
<P>If you have bigger problems, you could start <CODE>ypserv</CODE> and
<CODE>ypbind</CODE> in debug
mode on different xterms. The debug output should show you what goes
wrong.
<P>If you need to update a map, run <CODE>make</CODE> in the <CODE>/var/yp</CODE>
directory on the NIS master. This will update a map if the source file
is newer, and push the files to the slave servers. Please don't use
<CODE>ypinit</CODE> for updating a map.
<P>You might want to edit root's crontab *on the slave* server and add the
following lines:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      20 *    * * *    /usr/lib/yp/ypxfr_1perhour
      40 6    * * *    /usr/lib/yp/ypxfr_1perday
      55 6,18 * * *    /usr/lib/yp/ypxfr_2perday
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This will ensure that most NIS maps are kept up-to-date, even if an
update is missed because the slave was down at the time the update was
done on the master.
<P>You can add a slave at every time later. At first, make sure that
the new slave server has permissions to contact the NIS master. Then run
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    % /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -s masterhost
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

on the new slave. On the master server, add the new slave server name
to <CODE>/var/yp/ypservers</CODE> and run <CODE>make</CODE> in <CODE>/var/yp</CODE>
to update the map.
<P>
<P>If you want to restrict access for users to your NIS server, you'll have
to setup the NIS server as a client as well by running ypbind and adding the
plus-entries to /etc/passwd _halfway_ the password file. The library
functions will ignore all normal entries after the first NIS entry, and
will get the rest of the info through NIS. This way the NIS access rules
are maintained. An example:

     miquels:1234567890123:101:10:Miquel van Smoorenburg:/home/miquels:/bin/zsh
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thus the user "tester" will exist, but have a shell of /etc/NoShell. miquels
will have normal access.
<P>Alternatively, you could edit the <CODE>/var/yp/Makefile</CODE> file
and set NIS to use
another source password file. On large systems the NIS password and group
files are usually stored in <CODE>/etc/yp/</CODE>. If you do this the normal
tools to administrate the password file such as <CODE>passwd</CODE>, <CODE>chfn</CODE>,
<CODE>adduser</CODE> will not work anymore and you need special homemade tools
for this.
<P>However, <CODE>yppasswd</CODE>, <CODE>ypchsh</CODE> and <CODE>ypchfn</CODE> will
work of course.

<!--NIS!yps server--><!--yps NIS server--></H2>

<P>To set up the "yps" NIS server please refer to the previous paragraph.
The "yps" server setup is similar, _but_ not exactly the same so
beware if you try to apply the "ypserv" instructions to "yps"!
"yps" is not supported by any author, and contains some security leaks.
You really shouldn't use it !
<P>The "yps" NIS server software can be found on:

<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 The Program rpc.ypxfrd</A>
<!--NIS|rpc.ypxfrd daemon--><!--rpc.ypxfrd daemon--></H2>

<P>rpc.ypxfrd is used for speed up the transfer of very large
NIS  maps  from a NIS master to NIS slave servers. If a
NIS slave server receives a message that there is  a  new
map,  it  will  start  ypxfr  for transfering the new map.
ypxfr will read the contents of  a  map  from  the  master
server  using the yp_all() function. This process can take
several minutes when there are very large maps which  have
to store by the database library.
<P>
<P>The  rpc.ypxfrd  server  speeds up the transfer process by
allowing NIS slave  servers  to  simply  copy  the  master
server's  map  files  rather  than building their own from
scratch.  rpc.ypxfrd uses an RPC-based file transfer  protocol,
so that there is no need for building a new map.
<P>
<P>rpc.ypxfrd can be started by inetd. But since it starts
very slow, it should be started with ypserv. You need to start
rpc.ypxfrd only on the NIS master server.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 The Program rpc.yppasswdd</A>
<!--NIS!rpc.yppasswdd daemon--><!--rpc.yppasswdd daemon--></H2>

<P>Whenever users change their passwords, the NIS password database and
probably other NIS databases, which depend on the NIS password
database, should be updated.  The program "rpc.yppasswdd" is a server that
handles password changes and makes sure that the NIS information will
be updated accordingly. rpc.yppasswdd is now integrated in ypserv. You
don't need the older, separate yppasswd-0.9.tar.gz or yppasswd-0.10.tar.gz,
and you shouldn't use them any longer. The rpc.yppasswdd in ypserv 1.3.2
has full shadow support. yppasswd is now part of yp-tools-2.2.tar.gz.
<P>You need to start rpc.yppasswdd only on the NIS master server. By default,
users are not allowed to change their full name or the login shell.
You can allow this with the -e chfn or -e chsh option.
<P>If your passwd and shadow files are not in another directory then
/etc, you need to add the -D option. For example, if you have put
all source files in /etc/yp and wish to allow the user to change
his shell, you need to start rpc.yppasswdd with the following parameters:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   rpc.yppasswdd -D /etc/yp -e chsh
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   rpc.yppasswdd -s /etc/yp/shadow -p /etc/yp/passwd -e chsh
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There is nothing more to do. You just need to make sure, that
<CODE>rpc.yppasswdd</CODE> uses the same files as <CODE>/var/yp/Makefile</CODE>.
Errors will be logged using syslog.
