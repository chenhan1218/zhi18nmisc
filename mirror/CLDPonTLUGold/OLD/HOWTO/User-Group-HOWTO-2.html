<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What is Linux?</A>
</H2>

<P>In order to appreciate and understand fully the significant role of
LUGs in the Linux Movement, it is important to understand what makes
Linux unique among computer operating systems.
<P>Linux as an operating system is very efficient and very powerful. But,
Linux as an <I><B>idea</B></I> about how software ought to be
developed is even more powerful. Linux is a <B>free</B> operating
system: it is licensed under the GNU Public License. The source code
is freely available to anyone who wants it and always will be. It is
developed by a unstructured group of programmers from around the
world, under the technical direction of Linus Torvalds and other key
developers. Linux is a world-wide movement without any central
structure, bureaucracy, or entity to control, coordinate, or otherwise
direct its affairs. While this situation is a powerful part of the
appeal and technical quality of Linux as an computer operating system,
it can make for inefficient allocation of human resources, ineffective
and even detrimental advocacy, public relations, user education and
training.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 How is Linux unique?</A>
</H2>

<P>This loose structure is not likely to change with regard to Linux as a
software project. And it's a good thing, too. Linux works precisely
because people are free to come and go as they please: <B>free
programmers are happy programmers are effective programmers</B>.
<P>But this loose structure can make the average Linux user's life a
little complicated--especially if that user isn't a programmer by
profession or by vocation. Who does she call for support, training, or
education? How does she know the kinds of uses for which Linux is
well-suited?
<P>In large part local LUGs provide the answers to these kinds of
question. This is why LUGs are a crucial part of the Linux
Movement. Because there is no ``regional office'' of the Linux
Corporation in your town or village or metropolis, the local LUG takes
on many of the same roles that a regional office does for a large
multi-national corporation..
<P>Linux is unique because it does not have, nor is it burdened by, a
central structure or bureaucracy to allocate its resources, train its
users, or provide support for its products. These jobs get done in a
variety of ways: the Internet, consultants, VARs, support companies,
colleges and universities. But, increasingly, in many places around
the globe, they get done by a local LUG.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 What is a user group?</A>
</H2>

<P>Computer user groups, at least in the United States, are not a new
phenomenon; in fact, they played an important role in the history of
the personal computer. The personal computer arose in large part to
satisfy the demand of electronics, Ham Radio, and other hobbyist user
groups, as well as trade shows and swap meets, for affordable,
personal access to computing resources. Of course eventually giants
like IBM discovered that the PC was a good and profitable thing, but
the impetus for the PC came from the people, by the people, and for
the people.
<P>In the United States, user groups have changed, and many for the
worse, with the times. The financial woes of the largest user group
ever, the 
<A HREF="http://www.bcs.org/">Boston Computer Society</A> have been well-reported; but all over the
U.S. most of the big PC user groups have seen a decline in real
membership. American user groups in their heyday concentrated on the
production of newsletters, the maintenance of shareware and diskette
libraries, meetings, social events, and, sometimes, even Bulletin
Board Systems. With the advent of the Internet, however, many of the
services that user groups once provided were transferred to things
like CompuServe, AOL, and the Web.
<P>The rise of Linux, however, coincided with and was intensified by
general public's ``discovery'' of the Internet. As the Internet grew
more popular, so did Linux: the Internet brought new users,
developers, and vendors to the Linux Movement.
<P>So just when traditional PC user groups were declining because of the
Internet's popularity, this popularity propelled Linux forward,
creating new demand for new user groups dedicated exclusively to
Linux. To give just one indication of the ways in which a LUG is
different than a traditional user group, I call the reader's attention
to a curious fact: traditional user groups have had to maintain a
fairly tight control over the kinds of software that its users copy
and trade at its meetings. While illegal copying of commercial
software certainly occurred at these meetings, it was officially
discouraged and for good reason.
<P>At a LUG meeting, however, this entire mindset simply does not
apply. Far from being the kind of thing that a LUG ought to
discourage, the free copying of Linux itself ought to be one of the
primary activities of a LUG. In fact there is anecdotal evidence that
traditional user groups sometimes have a difficult time adapting to
the fact that Linux can be freely copied as many times as one needs or
wants.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Summary</A>
</H2>

<P>In order for the Linux Movement to continue to flourish, the
proliferation and success of local LUGs, along with other factors, is
an absolute requirement. Because of the unique status of Linux, the
local LUG must provide some of the same functions that a ``regional
office'' provides for large computer corporations like IBM, Microsoft,
or Sun. LUGs can and must train, support, and educate Linux users,
coordinate Linux consultants, advocate Linux as a computing solution,
and even serve as a liason to local media outlets like newspapers and
television.
