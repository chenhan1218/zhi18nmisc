<P>
<P>This HOWTO covers connecting a UPS to a computer running Linux.  The
idea is to connect the two in such a way that Linux can shutdown
cleanly when the power goes out, and before the UPS's battery gives
out.
<P>This includes pointing out the existence of software packages which
aid in establishing such communications, and detailing exactly how
such communications are carried out.  The latter often is unnecessary
if you can find a software package that's already been configured for
your UPS.  Otherwise, you'll have to read on.
<P>To a large extent this document is even more redundant than when I
originally wrote it three years ago.  All the basic information has
always been contained in the <CODE>powerd</CODE> man page that comes with the
<CODE>SysVinit</CODE> package.  Whereas three years ago one could commonly
find Linux distributions which didn't even include this man page, I
don't believe this is the case any longer.
<P>Furthermore, when I first wrote this Howto, there was no software
other than <CODE>powerd.c</CODE> for Linux/UPS communications and control.
Today there are quite afew UPS control packages available in 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/ups">Sunsite's UPS directory</A>.
<P>None the less, I'm continuing to maintain the UPS Howto.  Why bother?
Well,
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An additional general overview might help to understand how
to connect a Linux system to a UPS, even if it's just the same
information written differently.</LI>
<LI>The HOWTO is serving as a repository for UPS specific data -
there are many UPSs that haven't yet been incorporated into the
general packages.</LI>
<LI>The HOWTO contains additional details that aren't available
in other documents.</LI>
<LI>Some of the UPS software packages available in 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/ups">Sunsite's UPS directory</A> seem 
to be quite sparsely documented.  You might need to read this
before you can understand how to use them.</LI>
<LI>This thing seems to have a life of it's own now.  It's clear
when a Howto should be born.  It's less clear when it should be
put to sleep.</LI>

messages can be out of date.  The above is probably out of date too,

Please email me and I'll add you.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Important disclaimer</A>
</H2>

<P>I really can't guarantee that any of this will work for you.
Connecting a UPS to a computer can be a tricky business.  One or the
other or both might burn out, blow up, catch fire, or start World War
Three.  Furthermore, I only have direct experience with the Advice
1200 A UPS, and a 5kva Best Ferrups, and I didn't have to make a
cable.  So, BE CAREFUL. GATHER ALL INFORMATION YOU CAN ON YOUR UPS.
THINK FIRST.  DON'T IMPLICITLY TRUST ANYTHING YOU READ HERE OR
ANYWHERE ELSE.
<P>On the other hand, I managed to get everything working with my UPSs,
without much information from the manufacturer, and without blowing
anything up, so it is possible.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Other documents</A>
</H2>

<P>This document does not cover the general features and capabilities of
UPSs.  For that type of information, you might turn to 
<A HREF="ftp://navigator.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/doc/faq/UPS.faq">The UPS FAQ</A>.  It
can also be found at 
<A HREF="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/comp/answers/UPS-faq">ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/comp/answers/UPS-faq</A>.
It is maintained by Nick Christenson (
<A HREF="mailto:npc@minotaur.jpl.nasa.gov">npc@minotaur.jpl.nasa.gov</A>), but seems to have last been
updated in 1995.  In email to him, he'd like that 
you put <CODE>UPS</CODE> or <CODE>UPS FAQ</CODE> or something along these lines in the
Subject line of the message.
<P>There're also more and more UPS manufactures sprouting up on the net.
Some of them actually supply useful information on their web sites.  A
convenient list of UPS manufacturers' web sites is available at 
<A HREF="http://www.upssystems.uk.com/upsdir.html">The UPS Directory</A>.  Said site also has a
