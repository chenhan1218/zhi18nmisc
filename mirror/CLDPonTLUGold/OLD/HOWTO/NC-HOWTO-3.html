<P>You found all the software you needed.  Now let's install them.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 AIX License</A>
</H2>

<P>Before making the tarball on the aix machine, make sure you run
/usr/netstation/bin/agree in order to make the kernel in a usable format.
Probably you will have to do the same thing with the tarball you get from
the IBM website.  So finding the kernel separatly might be another
solution.
Find a drive with about 25Mb of free diskspace, I use /usr/netstation/,
and unpack the tarbal either from the IBM website or from an AIX machine.
There is no need in using the approx 60Mb from /usr/netstation/doc on
the disk if you don't have enough diskspace.

<LI> Download nsmsetup.exe from

<A HREF="http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/nc/pcserver/index2.shtml">http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/nc/pcserver/index2.shtml</A> </LI>
<LI> I don't have NT set up, so I moved it over into a Win98 partition
and tried executing nsmsetup.exe. It extracted properly, then choked
on the install and removed all the install files. Then I tried opening
it with WinZip, and that worked. I just extracted everything into my
Windows partition under the directory C:/netstation.
</LI>
<LI> I then copied everything from C:/netstation/prodbase to my linux
box. I set everything up in /usr/netstation, which I think was a
mistake. I ran strings on parts of the package, and it looks like
/netstation/prodbase is compiled into various programs. I'm going to
try it again with installing in /netstation/prodbase</LI>
<LI> Booting the kernel worked fine. I'm not sure how much of the rest
of it worked, since I've never seen a working netstation. I'm getting
a lot of error messages, but an X server comes up, and I'm able to
telnet and start Mwm.  I was able to set up xdm and log into my Linux
server, until I botched something. Now I get an IBM login screen that
doesn't allow me to log in.</LI>

<P>Philip Tait wrote to tell us this :
"From the directory tree extracted from nsmsetup.exe using WinZIP
classic, copy the entire tree  under "Prodbase" to /netstation.  Export
/netstation, and proceed as for the following sections.

<H3>Setting up the nfs server</H3>

<P>Edit your /etc/exports,
add the line

/usr/netstation   10.0.0.50(rw)

Where 10.0.0.50 is the IP address you want to give to the NC.
Restart your nfs deamon.

<P>Your NC should now be able to mount the /usr/netsation by NFS.
<P>Bascially if you don`t need X-Windows this is as far as it gets.  You can
easily telnet from your NC with nothing more installed.  However the beauty
of this thing is it`s X capability.
<H3>Setting up the X server</H3>

<P>Next we have to set up the X server.  Basically I didn't need to set up
anything, all of my machines that ran X-Windows were configured to accept
connections.  I just started up the NC for the first time and it showed me
all the machines that ran an XDM (cfr running an X -indirect).  So any
machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.  Just make sure XDM is
So any machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.  Just make sure
XDM is started.  
<P> Everything on the server side should be setup now. 
Lets try the NC side.
