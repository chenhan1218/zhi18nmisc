<P>
<UL>
<LI>More on security of all the services we install (clear text password, DoS by
overflowing partition in mail and ftp, http access configs etc), including
maybe the very basic ipchains setup (ipchains as safer alternative to tcp wrappers)</LI>
<LI>Add info on POP3 and ftp tunneling via ssh (just for fun) or refer to other HOWTOs</LI>
<LI>Add troubleshooting subsections to various sections</LI>
<LI>Add SSL-enabled Apache install and basic configuration</LI>
<LI>Add news server setup

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Standard disclaimer</A>
</H2>

<P>No liability for the contents of this document can be accepted.
Use the concepts, examples and other content at your own risk.
Additionally, this is an early version, with many possibilities
for inaccuracies and errors.
<P>One of many possible setups will be described. In the Linux
world, there is usually a number of ways in which to accomplish
things.
<P>As far as I know, only programs that under certain terms may be
used or evaluated for personal purposes will be described. Most
of the programs will be available complete with source under
GNU-like terms.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Support</A>
</H2>

<P>This is ridiculous, right? Who may ask for support after seeing such a
comprehensive doc ;-) ? 
<P>Anyhow, if you are curious about some particular aspect of this setup or some
of my writing is unclear, just drop me an email and I <I>might</I> answer it
(at least, be assured that I will read it).
<P>Now, if you require a phone, hand-holding style support or <B>my</B> work on
<B>your</B> system, I <I>might</I> be able to provide it on certain terms
(if I have time and your case seems interesting enough ;-) )
