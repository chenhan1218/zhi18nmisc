<H2><A NAME="s6">6. What do you need to set up NIS?</A><!--NIS!setting up--></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Determine whether you are a Server, Slave or Client.</A>
<!--NIS!determining system type--></H2>

<P>To answer this question you have to consider two cases:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Your machine is going to be part of a network with existing NIS servers</LI>
<LI>You do not have any NIS servers in the network yet</LI>
</OL>
<P>In the first case, you only need the client programs (ypbind, ypwhich,
ypcat, yppoll, ypmatch). The most important program is ypbind. This
program must be running at all times, which means, it should always appear
in the list of processes. It is a daemon process and needs to
be started from the system's startup file (eg. /etc/init.d/nis,
/sbin/init.d/ypclient, /etc/rc.d/init.d/ypbind, /etc/rc.local).
As soon as ypbind is running your system has become a NIS client.
<P>In the second case, if you don't have NIS servers, then you will also
need a NIS server program (usually called ypserv). Section
<A HREF="NIS-HOWTO-8.html#ypserv">Setting up a NIS Server</A>  describes
how to set up a NIS server on your Linux machine using the "ypserv"
implementation by Peter Eriksson and Thorsten Kukuk.
Note that from version 0.14 this implementation supports the
master-slave concept talked about in section 4.1.
<P>There is also another free NIS server available, called "yps", written
by Tobias Reber in Germany which does support the master-slave concept,
but has other limitations and isn't supported since a long time.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 The Software</A>
<!--NIS!library requirements--></H2>

<P>The system library "/usr/lib/libc.a" (version 4.4.2 and better) or the
shared library "/lib/libc.so.x" contain all necessary system calls to
succesfully compile the NIS client and server software. For the
GNU C Library 2 (glibc 2.x), you also need /lib/libnsl.so.1.
<P>Some people reported that NIS only works with "/usr/lib/libc.a" version
4.5.21 and better so if you want to play it safe don't use older
libc's.  The NIS client software can be obtained from:

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once you obtained the software, please follow the instructions which
come with the software. yp-clients 2.2 are for use with libc4 and libc5
until 5.4.20. libc 5.4.21 and glibc 2.x needs yp-tools 1.4.1 or later.
The new yp-tools 2.2 should work with every Linux libc. Since there was
a bug in the NIS code, you shouldn't use libc 5.4.21-5.4.35. Use libc
5.4.36 or later instead, or the most YP programs will not work.
ypbind 3.3 will work with all libraries, too. If you use gcc 2.8.x or
greater, egcs or glibc 2.x, you should add the ypbind-3.3-glibc5.diff
patch to ypbind 3.3. Please never use the ypbind from yp-clients 2.2.
ypbind-mt is a new, multithreaded daemon. It needs a Linux 2.2 kernel,
and glibc 2.1 or later.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 The ypbind daemon</A>
<!--NIS!ypbind daemon--><!--ypbind NIS daemon--><!--daemon!ypbind--></H2>

<P>After you have succesfully compiled the software you are now ready
to install it. A suitable place for the ypbind daemon is the directory
/usr/sbin. Some people may tell you that you don't need
ypbind on a system with NYS. This is wrong. ypwhich and ypcat need it
always.
<P>You must do this as root of course. The other binaries (ypwhich,
ypcat, yppasswd, yppoll, ypmatch) should go in a directory accessible
by all users, normally /usr/bin.
<P>Newer ypbind versions have a configuration file called /etc/yp.conf. You can
hardcode a NIS server there - for more info see the manual page for ypbind(8).
You also need this file for NYS.
An example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  ypserver voyager
  ypserver defiant
  ypserver ds9
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If the system cam resolv the hostnames without NIS, you may use
the name, otherwise you have to use the IP address. ypbind 3.3 has a bug
and will only use the last entry (ypserver ds9 in the example). All
other entries are ignored. ypbind-mt handle this correct and uses
that one, which answerd at first.
<P>It might be a good idea to test ypbind before  incorporating it in the
startup files. To test ypbind do the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Make sure you have your YP-domain name set. If it is not set then
issue the command:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
            /bin/domainname nis.domain
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


where <CODE>nis.domain</CODE> should be some string _NOT_ normally
associated with the DNS-domain name of your machine! The reason for
this is that it makes it a little harder for external crackers
to retreive the password database from your NIS servers. If you
don't know what the NIS domain name is on your network, ask
your system/network administrator.
</LI>
<LI>Start up "/usr/sbin/portmap" if it is not already running.
</LI>
<LI>Create the directory "/var/yp" if it does not exist.
</LI>
<LI>Start up "/usr/sbin/ypbind"
</LI>
<LI>Use the command "rpcinfo -p localhost" to check if ypbind
was able to register its service with the portmapper. The
output should look like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       program vers proto   port
        100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
        100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
        100007    2   udp    637  ypbind
        100007    2   tcp    639  ypbind
      
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


or

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       program vers proto   port
        100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
        100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
        100007    2   udp    758  ypbind
        100007    1   udp    758  ypbind
        100007    2   tcp    761  ypbind
        100007    1   tcp    761  ypbind
      
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


Depending on the ypbind version you are using.
</LI>
<LI>You may also run "rpcinfo -u localhost ypbind". This command
should produce something like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        program 100007 version 2 ready and waiting
      
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


or

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

        program 100007 version 2 ready and waiting
      
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


The output depends on the ypbind version you have installed.
Important is only the "version 2" message.</LI>
</UL>
<P>At this point you should be able to use NIS client programs like ypcat,
etc...  For example, "ypcat passwd.byname" will give you the entire NIS
password database.
<P>IMPORTANT: If you skipped the test procedure then make sure you have set
the domain name, and created the directory
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    /var/yp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This directory MUST exist for ypbind to start up succesfully.
<P>To check if the domainname is set correct, use the /bin/ypdomainname from
yp-tools 2.2. It uses the yp_get_default_domain() function which is more
restrict. It doesn't allow for example the "(none)" domainname, which
is the default under Linux and makes a lot of problems.
<P>If the test worked you may now want to change your startupd files
so that ypbind will be started at boot time and your system will
act as a NIS client. Make sure that the domainname will
be set before you start ypbind.
<P>Well, that's it. Reboot the machine and watch the boot messages to see
if ypbind is actually started.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Setting up a NIS Client using Traditional NIS</A>
<!--NIS!client setup--></H2>

<P>For host lookups you must set (or add) "nis" to the lookup order line
in your /etc/host.conf file. Please read the manpage "resolv+.8" for
more details.
<P>Add the following line to /etc/passwd on your NIS clients:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
+::::::
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can also use the + and - characters to include/exclude or change
users. If you want to exclude the user guest just add -guest to your
/etc/passwd file.  You want to use a different shell (e.g. ksh) for
the user "linux"?  No problem, just add "+linux::::::/bin/ksh"
(without the quotes) to your /etc/passwd. Fields that you don't want
to change have to be left empty. You could also use Netgroups for
user control.
<P>For example, to allow login-access only to miquels, dth and ed, and
all members of the sysadmin netgroup, but to have the account data
of all other users available use:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      +miquels:::::::
      +ed:::::::
      +dth:::::::
      +@sysadmins:::::::
      -ftp
      +:*::::::/etc/NoShell
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that in Linux you can also override the password field, as we did
in this example. We also remove the login "ftp", so it isn't known any
longer, and anonymous ftp will not work.
<P>The netgroup would look like
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
sysadmins (-,software,) (-,kukuk,)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>IMPORTANT: The netgroup  feature is implemented starting from libc 4.5.26.
If you have a version of libc earlier than 4.5.26, every user in the
NIS password database can access your linux machine if you run "ypbind" !
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 Setting up a NIS Client using NYS</A>
<!--NYS!client setup--></H2>

<P>All that is required is that the NIS configuration file
(/etc/yp.conf) points to the correct server(s) for its information.
Also, the Name Services Switch configuration file (/etc/nsswitch.conf)
must be correctly set up.
<P>You should install ypbind. It isn't needed by the libc, but the NIS(YP)
tools need it.
<P>If you wish to use the include/exclude user feature (+/-guest/+@admins),
you have to use "passwd: compat" and "group: compat" in nsswitch.conf.
Note that there is no "shadow: compat"! You have to
use "shadow: files nis" in this case.
<P>The NYS sources are part of the libc 5 sources. When run configure,
say the first time "NO" to the "Values correct" question,
then say "YES" to "Build a NYS libc from nys".
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 Setting up a NIS Client using glibc 2.x</A>
<!--NIS!client setup!using glibc 2.x--></H2>

<P>The glibc uses "traditional NIS", so you need to start ypbind. The
Name Services Switch configuration file (/etc/nsswitch.conf) must be
correctly set up. If you use the compat mode for passwd, shadow or group,
you have to add the "+" at the end of this files and you can use
the include/exclude user feature. The configuration is excatly the same
as under Solaris 2.x.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 The nsswitch.conf File</A>
<!--nsswitch.conf file--><!--NIS!nsswitch.conf file--></H2>

<P>The Network Services switch file /etc/nsswitch.conf determines the
order of lookups performed when a certain piece of information is
requested, just like the /etc/host.conf file which determines the way
host lookups are performed. For example, the line
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    hosts: files nis dns
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>specifies that host lookup functions should first look in the local
/etc/hosts file, followed by a NIS lookup and finally through the domain
name service (/etc/resolv.conf and named), at which point if no match
is found an error is returned. This file must be readable for every
user! You can find more information in the man-page nsswitch.5
or nsswitch.conf.5.
<P>A good /etc/nsswitch.conf file for NIS is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#
# /etc/nsswitch.conf
#
# An example Name Service Switch config file. This file should be
# sorted with the most-used services at the beginning.
#
# The entry '[NOTFOUND=return]' means that the search for an
# entry should stop if the search in the previous entry turned
# up nothing. Note that if the search failed due to some other reason
# (like no NIS server responding) then the search continues with the
# next entry.
#
# Legal entries are:
#
#       nisplus                 Use NIS+ (NIS version 3)
#       nis                     Use NIS (NIS version 2), also called YP
#       dns                     Use DNS (Domain Name Service)

<P>passwd_compat, group_compat and shadow_compat are only supported by glibc 2.x.
If there are no shadow rules in /etc/nsswitch.conf, glibc will use the passwd
rule for lookups. There are some more lookup module for glibc like hesoid.
For more information, read the glibc documentation.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8 Shadow Passwords with NIS</A>
<!--NIS!shadow passwords--></H2>

<P>Shadow passwords over NIS are always a bad idea. You loose the security,
which shadow gives you, and it is supported by only some few Linux C
Libraries. A good way to avoid shadow passwords over NIS is,
to put only the local system users in /etc/shadow. Remove the NIS user
entries from the shadow database, and put the password back in passwd.
So you can use shadow for the root login, and normal passwd for NIS
user. This has the advantage that it will work with every NIS client.
<P>
<H3>Linux</H3>

<P>The only Linux libc which supports shadow passwords over NIS, is the
GNU C Library 2.x. Linux libc5 has no support for it. Linux
libc5 compiled with NYS enabled has some code for it. But this code
is badly broken in some cases and doesn't work with all correct
shadow entries.
<P>
<H3>Solaris</H3>

<P>Solaris does not support shadow passwords over NIS.
<P>
<H3>PAM<!--PAM!shadow passwords--></H3>

<P>PAM does not support Shadow passwords over NIS, especially
pam_pwdb/libpwdb. This is a big problem for RedHat 5.x users. If you
have glibc and PAM, you need to change the /etc/pam.d/* entries.
Replace all pam_pwdb rules through pam_unix_*
modules. Due a bug in the pam_unix_auth.so module this will not always
work.
<P>An example /etc/pam.d/login file looks like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#%PAM-1.0
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_securetty.so
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_unix_auth.so
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_nologin.so
account    required     /lib/security/pam_unix_acct.so
password   required     /lib/security/pam_unix_passwd.so
session    required     /lib/security/pam_unix_session.so
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For auth you need to use the pam_unix_auth.so module, for account the
pam_unix_acct.so, for password the pam_unix_passwd.so and for
session the pam_unix_session.so module.
