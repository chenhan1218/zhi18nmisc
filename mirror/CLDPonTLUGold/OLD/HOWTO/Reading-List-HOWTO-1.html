<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Purpose of this document</A>
</H2>

<P>This document lists what I consider to be the essential book-length
references for learning Unix (especially Linux) and how to program under
it.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 New versions of this document</A>
</H2>

<P>New versions of the Linux Reading List HOWTO will be periodically
posted to 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.answers">comp.os.linux.answers</A>.  They will also be uploaded to
various Linux WWW and FTP sites, including the LDP home page.
<P>You can also view the latest version of this on the World Wide
Web via the URL 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Reading-List-HOWTO.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Reading-List-HOWTO.html</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Feedback and Corrections</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have questions or comments about this document (or just
want to suggest a book that you think should be on it), please feel
free to mail Eric S. Raymond, at 
<A HREF="mailto:esr@thyrsus.com">esr@thyrsus.com</A>. I welcome any
suggestions or criticisms.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Related Resources</A>
</H2>

<P>For on-line HOWTOs, magazines, and other non-book material, see the
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO">Linux Documentation Project home page</A>.
<P>Some years ago I wrote a less Linux-focused Unix bibliography that
may still be of some interest and retains a certain amusement
value.  You can find the Loginataka at 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/loginataka.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/loginataka.html</A>.
<P>SAGE, the System Administrator's Guild, maintains an excellent list
of relevant books at 
<A HREF="http://www.usenix.org/sage/sysadmins/books/booklist.html">http://www.usenix.org/sage/sysadmins/books/booklist.html</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Conventions Used In This Document</A>
</H2>

<P>Comments not in quotes below are either mine, or I have seen no reason to
change them from those of Jim Haynes (previous maintainer of this document).
Comments sent in by others are in quotes, and have the name of the
commentator before them (JH is Jim Haynes).
<P>"See" URLs attached to publishing information point directly into the
publisher's web catalog and typically take you to a page containing
a cover shot, blurbs, and ordering information.  Books that don't
have these lack them because the publisher is using frames and the
catalog pages can't be bookmarked.
<P>Topic listings go roughly from the outside in (culture to user-land
programming to kernel programming to hardware).  Within sections I have
tried to list the most useful books first insofar as I am familiar with them.
It's just an embarrassing coincidence that this lists one of my books
first, honest! (Suggestions for a better organization cheerfully accepted.)
