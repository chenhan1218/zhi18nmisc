<P>
<P>This work was written following the experience we had at the Settore di
Geofisica of the Universita' di Bologna (Italy), where a VAX 4000 has been
superseded and replaced by Linux-based Pentium PCs. Most of my colleagues
are VMS users, and some of them have switched to Linux.
<P>``From VMS to Linux HOWTO'' was written by Guido Gonzato, 
<A HREF="guido ``at'' ibogeo.df.unibo.it">guido ``at'' ibogeo.df.unibo.it</A>, and Mike Miller, 
<A HREF="miller5@uiuc.edu">miller5@uiuc.edu</A> who contributed the section on reading VMS tapes.
Many thanks to my colleagues and friends who helped me define the needs and
habits of the average VMS user, especially to Dr. Warner Marzocchi.
<P>Please help me improve this HOWTO. I'm not a VMS expert and never will be,
so your suggestions and bug reports are more than welcome.
<P>Enjoy,
<P>Guido <CODE>=8-)</CODE>
