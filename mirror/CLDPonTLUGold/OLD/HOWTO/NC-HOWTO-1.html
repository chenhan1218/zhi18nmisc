<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What's this document</A>
</H2>

<P>Some unused piece of delicious hardware floating around on my desk.
Screaming to be used. 40 MB of
ram and a 403 PPC inside. 
<P>So I decided to give it a try and connect it to my local Linux network. 
I want to thank the company I work for because they gave me the chance 
to experiment with it.
<P>In this Howto we'll be dealing with an IBM Network Station model
8361-100, other models may be featured in the future.
<P>We also have some additional info about the other 2 models. The
8361-200 (Model 300)  and the 8362-A23 (Model 1000).  
More info can be found at

here)
<P>
<P>I'm trying to describe how I setup the NC, there are probably lots of
other ways to set up this machine, however this one works fine.
Any other remarks you might have from your own experience are welcome.
(Free Hardware too ;-))
<P>This Howto is not trying to be the Bible on NC's and Linux, it's
trying to get you started.  Contributions to this NC are most welcome. 
<P>During the past year I have received numerous comments on the HOWTO and lots
of help from 
other people (suprisingly a lot from inside IBM).   I've been busy
therefore now is the first time that I'm trying to do a real update of the
HOWTO.  Most people are asking me about Linux binaries to extract the
AIX distribution file.  I have heard about an internal IBM project that is
going on there but I have no accurate info on that matter yet.
<P>
<P>
<P>Things we still have to implement in this Howto
<UL>
<LI>How to export your homedir</LI>
<LI>How to run applications</LI>
<LI>How to run Java Applets</LI>
</UL>
<P>Help is appreciated ;-)
<P>
<P>
<P>This howto does not describe the more recent units like the 2200 and the
2800 , maliny because I haven't had any experience with them yet (hint),
and because they run Linux out of the box.
