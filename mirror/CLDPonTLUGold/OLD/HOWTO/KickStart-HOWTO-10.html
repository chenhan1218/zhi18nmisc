<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> After KickStart installation, my machine won't boot up.
The BIOS complains with a message like <CODE>Missing operating system</CODE>.
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> Sounds like the partition with the root filesystem on isn't
bootable.  Use <CODE>fdisk</CODE> to toggle its bootable status.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> After the floppy boots, I get the message:
<CODE>Error opening files for kickstart copy: File exists</CODE>.
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> Use a more recent version of <EM>boot.img</EM> and
<EM>supp.img</EM> - look in the <EM>updates</EM> directory of your
local RedHat mirror site.  There was a bug in some older versions
of these for RedHat 5.1.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Can you have all outstanding patches (update RPMs) applied
automatically too ?  How ?
<P>
<P><B>A1:</B> Copy the RPMs you want installing to the RPMS directory
from which the installation is going to take place, get rid of the
older RPMs, and update the file <EM>RedHat/base/hdlist</EM> with the
new RPM details.  See Appendix C for a script from Eric Doutreleau to do
this for you.  If you do this yourself, remember to run <EM>genhdlist</EM>
afterwards!
<P>
<P><B>A2:</B> Try this Perl script: 
<A HREF="http://wwwcache.ja.net/dev/patchup/">patchup</A>.  This compares the RPMs
your system has installed with those in a nominated directory and
reports on the ones it thinks need updating.  It can even install them
for you if you trust it to.
<P>
<P><B>A3:</B> 
<A HREF="http://rufus.w3.org/linux/rpm2html/">rpm2hml</A>
has a much more powerful (12MB of C code vs. a page of Perl!) version of A2.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> A single config file on the install server for all of the clients,
perhaps as a fallback after trying <EM>IPADDR-kickstart</EM> ?
<P>
<P><B>A1:</B> Use the BOOTP/DHCP 'boot file' parameter <EM>bf</EM> to set
the filename.
<P>
<P><B>A2:</B> Add a a record <CODE>bf=/kickstart/ks.cfg</CODE> to the relevant
entry in <EM>/etc/bootptab</EM>.
<P><B>Q:</B> More flexibility when things go wrong - e.g. prompt for alternate
locations if distribution not found on CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> ?
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Explicit exclusion of packages - e.g. everything apart from
<EM>sendmail</EM>.
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> Rebuild the <B>BASE</B> package without sendmail.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Choose which services are started automatically on boot-up by the
run-level scripts under <EM>/etc/rc.d/</EM>.
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> The <EM>chkconfig</EM> utility lets you configure which
services are run automatically on boot-up.  You can run this in your
post-installation script section, e.g. to run <EM>ypbind</EM> in run
levels 3, 4 and 5:
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
chkconfig --level 345 ypbind on
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>and it will start the ypbind level on the 345 level.
<P><B>Q:</B> When executing the shell commands in the <CODE>%post</CODE> section,
bring any output up in another virtual console rather than overwriting the
main screen.  <EM>Could be done in the shell commands section using
<CODE>open</CODE>?</EM>.
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> No problem - do something like this:
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  exec >/dev/tty5
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Does the filesystem creation code check for bad blocks ?
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> If you switch to the virtual console where the filesystem
creation output is being displayed, you won't see any mention of the
'read-only' test being performed.  Looks like the answer is no.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Can I arrange things so some of my machines are configured
differently from others ?
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> You could move the host dependent stuff into the
scripted section of the KickStart config - e.g. only install a given
RPM if on a given machine.  It would be useful to have a conditional
installation feature in the packages section of the config file,
e.g. switching on architecture, or hostname/domain name/IP address.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Are there any changes between RedHat 5.1 and 5.2 ?
<P>
<P><B>A1:</B> Lots of changes in the installer, but mostly bug fixes
or cosmetic improvements.  No impact on KickStart as far as I can
tell - from a <EM>diff -rcs</EM> of the two <EM>misc/src/install</EM>
directories.
<P>
<P><B>A2:</B> RH5.2 now apparently includes the automatic IP allocation/DHCP
patches to <CODE>bootpd</CODE>, but they have left out the documentation
which tells you how to use it.
<P><B>Q:</B> (How) can you clear a specific partition or partitions ?
e.g. to leave <EM>/home</EM> but zap <EM>/</EM>.
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> You can't - yet!
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Can you arrange to have your partitions created across
multiple drives ?  e.g. <EM>/</EM> on <CODE>sda</CODE> and <EM>/home</EM>
on <CODE>sdb</CODE>.
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> Don't think so - looks like you only get access to the
first drive from the partitioning tool.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Is it possible to specify existing partitions to be
included in the mount table, or is it only possible to specify the
creation of new partitions that will then be included?
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> ?
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> After running <CODE>mkkickstart</CODE>, where is the file
it creates?
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> It doesn't create a file - it dumps the KickStart
config to <CODE>stdout</CODE>.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> In virtual console 4 (Alt-F4) I get <CODE>Unable to load NLS
charset cp437(nls_cp437)</CODE>.  What does this mean ?  Should I be
worried ?
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> Sounds like you're trying to mount a CD-ROM burned with
the Joliet (Unicode extensions to ISO 9660.  In theory the filenames
on the CD-ROM might get munched and not make it through to Linux
correctly.  In practice it doesn't seem to cause any problems -
could be a spurious dependency ?
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Why am i getting the X Window System installed ? I didn't
put it in my list of packages.
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> The <CODE>XFree86-VGA16</CODE> RPM is a 'base' component, and
as such always gets installed - unless you change the definition of
the base class.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> In my post-installation script, can I use the packages
which have been installed by now to do funky things not possible with
the limited tools on the floppies ?
<P>
<P><B>A:</B> Yep - e.g. if you chose to install Perl when you put your
KickStart config together, almost anything is possible in about five
lines :-)
