<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P> This HOWTO covers basic info on the Serial Port and multiport
serial cards.  Information specific to modems and text-terminals has
been moved to Modem-HOWTO and Text-Terminal-HOWTO.  Info on getty (the
program that runs the login process or the like) has been also moved
to these HOWTOs since mgetty and uugetty are best for modems while
agetty is best for text-terminals.  If you are dealing with a modem,
text terminal, or printer, then you may not need to consult this
HOWTO.  But if you are using the serial port for some other device,
using a multiport serial card, trouble-shooting the serial port
itself, or want to understand more technical details of the serial
port, then you may want to use this HOWTO as well as some of the other
HOWTOs.  (See 
<A HREF="#related_howtos">Related HOWTO's</A>)  This
HOWTO lists info on various multiport serial cards since they may be
used for either modems or text-terminals.  This HOWTO addresses Linux
running on PCs (ISA or PCI buses), although it might be valid for
other architectures.

He also rewrote many contributions by others in order to maintain
continuity in the writing style and flow.  He wrote: ``Thanks to
everyone who has contributed or commented, the list of people has
gotten too long to list (somewhere over one hundred).  Special thanks
to Ted Ts'o for answering questions about the serial drivers.''
Approximately half of v2.00 was from Greg Hankins HOWTO and the other
half is by David Lawyer.  Ted Ts'o has continued to be helpful.

<P> New versions of the Serial-HOWTO will be available to
browse and/or download at LDP mirror sites.  For a list of mirror
sites see:

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 What is a Serial Port?</A>
</H2>

<P> The conventional serial port (not the newer USB port, or HSSI
port) is a very old I/O port.  Almost all PC's have them.  But Macs
(Apple Computer) after mid 1998 (with colored cases) only have the USB
port.  It's possible, however, to put a conventional serial port
device on the USB.  
<P>The common specification for the conventional serial port is RS-232
(or EIA-232).  The connector for the serial port is often seen as one
or two 9-pin connectors (in some cases 25-pin) on the back of a PC.
But the serial port is is more than just that.  It includes the
associated electronics which must produce signals conforming to the
EIA-232 specification.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-17.html#volt_shape">Voltage Waveshapes</A>.  One pin is used to send out data bytes and another to
receive data bytes.  Another pin is a common signal ground.  The other
"useful" pins are used mainly for signalling purposes with a steady
negative voltage meaning "off" and a steady positive voltage meaning
"on".
<P>The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) chip does most
of the work.  Today, the functionality of this chip is usually built
into another chip.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-15.html#uart_">What Are UARTs?</A> These
have improved over time and old models (several years old) are now
obsolete.
<P>The serial port was originally designed for connecting modems but it's
used to connect many other devices also such as mice, text-terminals, some
printers, etc. to a computer.  You just plug these devices into the
serial port using the correct cable.  Many internal modem cards have a
built-in serial port so when you install one inside your PC it's as if
you just installed another serial port in your PC.
