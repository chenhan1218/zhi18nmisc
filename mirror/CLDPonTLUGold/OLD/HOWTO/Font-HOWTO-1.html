</H2>

<P>I'm going to make this brief (-; The purpose of this document is to address
what was a gaping hole in font documentation. While previously, there
were several documents about fonts for Linux, I felt that none of them
were comprehensive, all of them had a relatively narrow focus. Hence
the goal of this document is not to provide radical new insight into 
the issue of font handling ( though I have included material previously 
unavailable ), the main aim is to provide a comprehensive source to act 
as a starting point for any and all font questions about Linux.

<P>Special thanks are due to Rod Smith, who made several helpful suggestions,

Also thanks to Doug Holland, whose Font Deuglification HOWTO proved
to be a good reference, John McLaughlin, author of the document that
helped me come to grips with Star Office, 
and the Linux community for their suggestions
and construtive comments.
