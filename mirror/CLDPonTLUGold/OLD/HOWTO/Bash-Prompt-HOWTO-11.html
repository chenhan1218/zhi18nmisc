<H2><A NAME="s11">11. Prompt Code Snippets</A></H2>

<P>This section shows how to put various pieces of information into the Bash
prompt.  There are an infinite number of things that could be put in your
prompt.  Feel free to send me examples, I will try to include what I think
will be most widely used.  If you have an alternate way to retrieve a piece
of information here, and feel your method is more efficient, please contact
me.  It's easy to write bad code, I do it often, but it's great to write
elegant code, and a pleasure to read it.  I manage it every once in a
while, and would love to have more of it to put in here.
<P>
<P>To incorporate shell code in prompts, it has to be escaped.  Usually, this
will mean putting it inside <CODE>\$(&lt;command&gt;)</CODE> so that the output
of <CODE>command</CODE> is substituted each time the prompt is generated.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 Built-in Escape Sequences</A>
</H2>

<P>See 
<A HREF="Bash-Prompt-HOWTO-2.html#bpescapes">Bash Prompt Escape Sequences</A> for a complete
list of built-in escape sequences.  This list is taken directly from the
Bash man page, so you can also look there.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Date and Time</A>
</H2>

<P>If you don't like the built-ins for date and time, extracting the same
information from the <CODE>date</CODE> command is relatively easy.  Examples
already seen in this HOWTO include <CODE>date +%H%M</CODE>, which will put
in the hour in 24 hour format, and the minute.  <CODE>date "+%A, %d %B
%Y"</CODE> will give something like "Sunday, 06 June 1999".  For a full list
of the interpreted sequences, type <CODE>date --help</CODE> or <CODE>man
date</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.3">11.3 Counting Files in the Current Directory</A>
</H2>

<P>To determine how many files there are in the current directory, put in
<CODE>ls -l | wc -l</CODE>.  This uses <CODE>wc</CODE> wordcount to do a count of
the number of lines (-l) in the output of <CODE>ls -l</CODE>.  It doesn't count
dotfiles.  If you want to count only files and NOT include symbolic links
(just an example of what else you could do), you could use <CODE>ls -l | grep
-v ^l | wc -l</CODE>.  Here, <CODE>grep</CODE> checks for any line beginning with
"l" (indicating a link), and discards that line (-v).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4 Total Bytes in the Current Directory</A>
</H2>

<P>If you want to know how much space the contents of the current directory
take up, you can use something like the following:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
# The sed command replaces all the spaces with only one space.
# cut -d" " -f5 : -d determines a delimiter, which means that (in 
# this case) a space begins a new column.
# -f says to take out a certain column, in this case the fifth one

let TotalBytes=0

for Bytes in $(ls -l | grep "^-" | sed -e "s/ \+/ /g" | cut -d" " -f5)
do
   let TotalBytes=$TotalBytes+$Bytes
done

# The if...fi's give a more specific output in byte, kilobyte, megabyte, 
# and gigabyte

if [ $TotalBytes -lt 1024 ]; then
   TotalSize=$(echo -e "scale=3 \n$TotalBytes \nquit" | bc)
else if [ $TotalBytes -lt 1048576 ]; then
   TotalSize=$(echo -e "scale=3 \n$TotalBytes/1024 \nquit" | bc)
else if [ $TotalBytes -lt 1073741824 ]; then
   TotalSize=$(echo -e "scale=3 \n$TotalBytes/1048576 \nquit" | bc)
else
   TotalSize=$(echo -e "scale=3 \n$TotalBytes/1073741824 \nquit" | bc)
fi
fi

<P>Code courtesy of Sam Schmit (id@pt.lu) and his uncle Jean-Paul, who ironed
out a fairly major bug in my original code, and just generally cleaned it
up.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 Checking the Current TTY</A>
</H2>

<P>The <CODE>tty</CODE> command returns the filename of the terminal connected to
standard input.  This comes in two formats on the Linux systems I have
used, either "/dev/tty4" or "/dev/pts/2".  I have taken to using a more
general solution to this: <CODE>tty | sed -e "s:/dev/::"</CODE>, which removes
the leading "/dev/".  Older systems
(in my experience, RedHat through 5.2) returned only filenames in the
"/dev/tty4" format, so I used <CODE>tty | sed -e "s/.*tty\(.*\)/\1/"</CODE>.
<P>
<P>An alternative method: <CODE>ps aux | grep $$ | awk '{ print $7 }'</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6 Suspended Job Count</A>
</H2>

<P>To find out how many suspended jobs you have, use <CODE>jobs | wc -l | awk
'{print $1}'</CODE>.  <CODE>awk</CODE> is used to trim the output, which would
otherwise include blank spaces that waste space in a prompt.  If you start
netscape from an xterm, this will also be counted.  If you want to avoid
that, and only count stopped jobs, use <CODE>jobs -s</CODE> instead.  Type
<CODE>help jobs</CODE> for more info on jobs.  <CODE>jobs</CODE> will always return
nothing to a pipe in version 2.02 of Bash: this problem is not present in
any other version.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.7">11.7 Uptime and Load</A>
</H2>

<P>Current load is taken from the <CODE>uptime</CODE> command.  What I use at the
moment is <CODE>uptime | sed -e "s/.*load average: \(.*\...\), .*\...,
.*\.../\1/" -e "s/ //g"</CODE> which is clunky in the extreme, but works.
Replacements welcome.  <CODE>uptime</CODE> can also be used in a very similar
manner to find out how long the machine has been up (obviously) or how many
users are logged in, and the data could be massaged with <CODE>sed</CODE> to
look the way you want it to.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.8">11.8 Number of Processes</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE>ps ax | wc -l | tr -d " "</CODE> <EM>OR</EM> <CODE>ps ax | wc -l | awk
'{print $1}'</CODE> <EM>OR</EM> <CODE>ps ax | wc -l | sed -e "s: ::g"</CODE>.  In
each case, <CODE>tr</CODE> or <CODE>awk</CODE> or <CODE>sed</CODE> is used to remove
the undesirable whitespace.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.9">11.9 Controlling the Width of $PWD</A>
</H2>

<P>Unix allows long file names, which can lead to the value of $PWD being very
long.  Some people (notably the default RedHat prompt) choose to use the
basename of the current working directory (ie. "giles" if
$PWD="/home/giles").  I like more info than that, but it's often desirable
to limit the length of the directory name, and it makes the most sense to
truncate on the left.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
#   How many characters of the $PWD should be kept
local pwd_length=30
if [ $(echo -n $PWD | wc -c | tr -d " ") -gt $pwd_length ]
then
   newPWD="...$(echo -n $PWD | sed -e "s/.*\(.\{$pwd_length\}\)/\1/")"
else
   newPWD="$(echo -n $PWD)"
fi
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The above code can be executed as part of PROMPT_COMMAND, and the
environment variable generated (<EM>newPWD</EM>) can then be included in
the prompt.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.10">11.10 Laptop Power</A>
</H2>

<P>Again, this isn't elegant, but it works (most of the time).  If you have a
laptop with APM installed, try <CODE>power=$(apm | sed -e "s/.*:
\([1-9][0-9]*\)%/\1/" | tr -d " ")</CODE> executed from PROMPT_COMMAND to
create an environment variable you can add to your prompt.  This will
indicate percentage power remaining.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.11">11.11 Having the Prompt Ignored on Cut and Paste</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This one is weird but cool.  Rory Toma (rory@corp.webtv.net) wrote to
suggest a prompt like this: <CODE>: rory@demon ;</CODE> .  How is this useful?
Well, if you type a command after the prompt (odd idea, that), you can
triple click on that line (in Linux, anyway) to highlight the whole line,
then paste that line in front of another prompt, and the stuff between the
":" and the "&quot;" is ignored, like so:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
: rory@demon ; uptime
  5:15pm  up 6 days, 23:04,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
: rory@demon ; : rory@demon ; uptime
  5:15pm  up 6 days, 23:04,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The prompt is a no-op, and if your PS2 is set to a space, multiple lines
can be cut and pasted as well.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="title-icon-bar"></A> <A NAME="ss11.12">11.12 Setting the Window Title and Icon Title Separately</A>
</H2>

<P>A suggestion from Charles Lepple (clepple@negativezero.org) on setting the
window title of the Xterm and the title of the corresponding icon
separately (first check out the earlier section 
<A HREF="Bash-Prompt-HOWTO-5.html#xterm-title-bar">Xterm Title Bar Manipulations</A>).  He uses this under WindowMaker
because the title that's appropriate for an Xterm is usually too long for a
64x64 icon.  "\[\e]1;icon-title\007\e]2;main-title\007\]".  He says to set
this in the prompt command because "I tried putting the string in PS1, but
it causes flickering under some window managers because it results in
setting the prompt multiple times when you are editing a multi-line command
(at least under bash 1.4.x -- and I was too lazy to fully explore the
reasons behind it)."  I had no trouble with it in the PS1 string, but
didn't use any multi-line commands.  He also points out that it works under
xterm, xwsh, and dtterm, but not gnome-terminal (which uses only the main
title).  I also found it to work with rxvt, but not kterm.
