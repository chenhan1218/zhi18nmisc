<H2><A NAME="s17">17. Setting up the X11 FBdev driver</A></H2>

<P>
<P>If you are not using XFree86 3.3.3.1 or later, you are urged to upgrade
to XFree86 3.3.3.1 - it includes a FBdev X driver for framebuffer devices.
Otherwise, follow the steps below to either download or build your own FBdev
driver for older XFree86 versions such as 3.3.2, 3.3.3 etc.
<P>Go to 
<PRE>
http://www.xfree86.org
</PRE>
, and download the latest XServers source archive, 
unpack, and configure the drivers, following these steps:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Edit xc/config/cf/xf86site.def, uncomment the #define for
XF68FBDevServer</LI>
<LI>Comment out <EM>all</EM> references to FB_VISUAL_STATIC_DIRECTCOLOR, as
these are bogus and aren't used any more. If you are using XFree86 3.3.3.1, 
there is no need to do this step - as they have removed this. </LI>
<LI>Edit xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/lnx_io.c, and
change K_RAW to K_MEDIUMRAW.</LI>
</UL>
<P>and then build the driver. Don't worry about the m68k references, it
supports Intel platforms. Then build the whole thing - it'll take a long
time though as it's a large source tree.
<P>Alternatively, if you don't have the time to spare, you can obtain the
binaries from the sites below. Please note that these are 'unofficial'
builds and you use them at your risk. 
<P>For libc5, use the one at:

http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~kraxel/linux/XF68_FBDev.gz
</PRE>

For glibc2, download from these URLs.

<P>There have been reports that X11 is non functional on certain graphic
cards with this vesafb feature enabled, if this is happening, try the new
XF86_FBdev driver for X11.
<P>This driver, along with vesafb can also help run X11 in higher graphic
resolutions with certain graphic chipsets which are not supported by any
of the current X11 drivers. Examples are MGA G-200 et. al.
<P>To configure the XF86_FBdev driver with your X11 system, you'll need to
edit your XF86Config for the following:
<P>
<PRE>
Section "Screen"
        Driver          "FBDev"
        Device          "Primary Card"
        Monitor         "Primary Monitor"
        SubSection      "Display"
                Modes           "default"
        EndSubSection
EndSection
</PRE>
<P>You'll also need to set XkbDisable in the keyboard section as well, or
invoke the XF86_FBDev server with the '-kb' option to set up your keyboard
so it works properly. If you forget to set XkbDisable, you will have to
put the following lines in your .Xmodmap to straighten out the keyboard
mappings. Alternatively, you can edit your xkb to reflect the list below. 
<P><EM>This is fixed in XFree86 3.3.3.1, and it is a good idea to upgrade to
this version anyway because there are quite a few bug fixes, and also,
it includes FBDev as one of the drvers, as I've mentioned previously.</EM>
<P>

! Keycode settings required
keycode 104 = KP_Enter
keycode 105 = Control_R
keycode 106 = KP_Divide
keycode 108 = Alt_R Meta_R
keycode 110 = Home
keycode 111 = Up
keycode 112 = Prior
keycode 113 = Left
keycode 114 = Right
keycode 115 = End
keycode 116 = Down
keycode 117 = Next
keycode 118 = Insert
keycode 119 = Delete
</PRE>
<P>You may need to do some fiddling around with this (try copying the
original definition from the original X11 driver that you were using and
editing the name of the driver to FBDev), but basically this is what you
need to do to use the vesafb X11 driver.
<P>Hopefully the X11 problems with supported graphic cards will be fixed in
future releases.
