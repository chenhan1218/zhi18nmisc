<P> While PPP is used for Internet access you also need a dialer
program that is designed to work with PPP.  Such a dialer program will
dial a phone number.  When the other side answers the phone then three
things happen: PPP is started at both ends and you get logged in
(often automatically).  The exact sequence of these 3 events may vary.
Dialer programs for ppp include wvdial, chap scripts, kppp, and
gnome-ppp.
<P>There are also other dialer programs which can dial out directly (thru
a modem) to local libraries, etc.  This isn't the Internet.
<CODE>minicom</CODE> is the most popular followed by <CODE>Seyon</CODE> (X-Windows
only) and <CODE>Kermit</CODE>.  People have likely also used these programs
for dialing out with ppp for the Internet but it's not what they were
originally designed for.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 Minicom vs. Kermit</A>
</H2>

<P> Minicom is only a communications program while Kermit is both a
communications program and a file transfer protocol.  But one may use
the Kermit protocol from within Minicom (provided one has Kermit
installed on one's PC).  Minicom is menu based while Kermit is
command line based (interactive at the special Kermit prompt).  While
the Kermit program is free software, the documentation is not all
free.  There is no detailed manual supplied and it is suggested that
you purchase a book as the manual.  However Kermit has interactive
online help which tells all but lacks tutorial explanations for the
beginner.  Commands may be put in a script file so you don't have to
type them over again each time.  Kermit (as a communications program)
is more powerful than Minicom. 
<P>Although all Minicom documentation is free, it's not as extensive as
Kermit's.  Since permission is required to include Kermit in a
commercial distribution, and since the documentation is not entirely
free, some distributions don't include Kermit.  In my opinion it's
easier to set up Minicom, there is less to learn, and you can still
use kermit from within Minicom.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2 List of Communication Software </A>
</H2>

<P> Here is a list of some communication software you can choose from,
If they didn't come with your distribution they should be available
via FTP.  I would like comparative comments on the dialout programs.
Are the least popular ones obsolete?

<H3><A NAME="fax_"></A> Fax </H3>

<P> By using a fax program, you may use most modems to send faxes.
In this case you dial out directly and not via ppp and an ISP.  You
also pay any long-distance telephone charges.  email is more
efficient.

<UL>
<LI><CODE>mgetty+fax</CODE> is for modems and is well documented (except for
voicemail as of early 1999).  It also handles fax stuff and provides
an alternative to <CODE>uugetty</CODE>.  It's incorporating voicemail (using
vgetty) features.  See

<P>
<H2><A NAME="term+slurp"></A> <A NAME="ss15.3">15.3 SLiRP and term </A>
</H2>

<P> <CODE>SLiRP</CODE> and <CODE>term</CODE> are programs which are of use if you only
have a dial-up shell account on a Unix-like machine and want to get
the equivalent of a PPP account (or the like) without being authorized
to have it (possibly because you don't want to pay extra for it, etc.).
<CODE>SLiRP</CODE> is more popular than <CODE>term</CODE> which is almost obsolete.
<P>To use <CODE>SLiRP</CODE> you install it in your shell account on the remote
computer.  Then you dial up the account and run SLiRP on the remote
and PPP on your local PC.  You now have a PPP connection over which
you may run a web browser on your local PC such as Netscape, etc.
There may be some problems as SLiRP is not as good as a real PPP
account.  Some accounts may provide SLiRP since it saves on IP
addresses (You have no IP address while using SLiRP).
<P><CODE>term</CODE> is something like SLiRP only you need to run <CODE>term</CODE> on
both the local and remote computer.  There is no PPP on the phone line
since <CODE>term</CODE> uses its own protocol.  To use <CODE>term</CODE> from your PC
you need to use a term-aware version of ftp to do ftp, etc.  Thus it's
easier to use SLiRP since the ordinary version of ftp works fine with
SLiRP.  There is an unmaintained Term HOWTO.

</H2>

<P> If you want someone who uses MS Windows to dial in to your Linux
PC then if they use:
<UL>
<LI> Windows 3.x: use <CODE>Terminal</CODE></LI>
<LI> Windows 95/98/2000: use <CODE>HyperTerminal</CODE> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Third party dial-out programs include HyperTerminal Private Edition.
