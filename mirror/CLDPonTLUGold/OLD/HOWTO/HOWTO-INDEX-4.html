<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Writing and Submitting a HOWTO</A></H2>

<P>If you are interested in writing or maintaining a HOWTO,
please contact us <B>FIRST!!!</B> at 
<CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org">ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org</A></CODE>.
If you want to maintain a unmaintained HOWTO, please try to contact
the former author.
<P>Consult the 
<A HREF="HOWTO-HOWTO/index.html">HOWTO-HOWTO</A> for
detailed information on writing and submitting a HOWTO.
<P>Here are a few general guidelines that you should follow when writing a HOWTO:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Try to use meaningful structure and organization, and write 
clearly. Remember that many of the people reading HOWTOs do not 
speak English as their first language.
</LI>
<LI>Make sure that all of the information is correct. I can't 
stress this enough. When in doubt, speculate, but make it clear that
you're only guessing. 
</LI>
<LI>Make sure that you are covering the most recent version of the
available software. Also, be sure to include full instructions
on where software can be downloaded from (FTP site name, full
pathname), and the current version number and release date of the 
software.
</LI>
<LI>Include an FAQ section at the end, if appropriate. Many HOWTO
documents need an ``FAQ'' or ``Common Problems'' section to cover
information which can't be covered in the regular text.
</LI>
<LI>HOWTOs <EM>should</EM> be submitted to us in either
DocBook or linuxdoc SGML. Refer to the 
<A HREF="HOWTO-HOWTO/index.html">HOWTO-HOWTO</A>
for further information.
</LI>
<LI>Use other HOWTOs a model.  The SGML source to 
the HOWTOs is available on Linux FTP sites.  In addition, examine the
<A HREF="HOWTO-HOWTO/index.html">HOWTO-HOWTO</A>, the
<A HREF="../manifesto.html">LDP manifesto</A> (and license guide), and the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/godoy/using-docbook/using-docbook.html">Using DocBook HOWTO</A>.
</LI>
<LI>Make sure that your name, email address, date, and a version
number is near the beginning of the document.  You could also include
WWW addresses and a snail mail address if you want.  The standard
header is:
<PRE>
        Title
        Author's name and email address
        Version number and date
        
</PRE>

for example:
<PRE>
        The Linux HOWTO Index
        by Tim Bynum
        v2.10.29, 31 July 1997
        
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI>Lastly, be prepared to receive questions and comments about
your writing.  There are several hundreds of accesses to the
HOWTO collection every day from around the world!</LI>
</UL>
<P>After you have written the HOWTO, mail the SGML source to us at 
<CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:ldp-submit@lists.linuxdoc.org">ldp-submit@lists.linuxdoc.org</A></CODE>.
<P>It is <EM>important</EM> that you go through us when submitting a HOWTO, as
we maintain the archives and need to keep track of what HOWTOs
are being written and who is doing what. 
<P>Please send the LDP periodic updates whenever appropriate.
