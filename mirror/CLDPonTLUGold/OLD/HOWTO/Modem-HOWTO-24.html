<P> This HOWTO currently only deals with the common type of modem used
to connect PC's to ordinary analog telephone lines.  There are various
other types of modems, including devices called modems that are not
really modems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss24.1">24.1 Digital-to-Digital "Modems"</A>
</H2>

<P> The standard definition of a modem is sometimes broadened to
include "digital" modems.  Today direct digital service is now being
provided to many homes and offices so a computer there sends out
digital signals directly (well almost) into the telephone lines.  But
a device is still needed to convert the computer digital signal into
the type allowed on telephone circuits and this device is sometimes
called a modem.  This HOWTO doesn't cover such modems but some links
to documents that do may be found at the start of this HOWTO.  The
next 3 sections: ISDN, DSL and 56k, concern digital-to-digital
"modems".
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss24.2">24.2 ISDN "Modems"</A>
</H2>

<P> Such a "modem" is  really a Terminal Adapter (TA).  Support for
some of them can be built into the kernel 2.4 or added as a module.
The kernel documentation has an isdn section.  Configuration might use
"isdn-config" GUI.  A Debian package "isdnutils" is available.  There
is a ISDN Howto in German with an English translation: 
<A HREF="http://sdb.suse.de/sdb/en/html/isdn.html">http://sdb.suse.de/sdb/en/html/isdn.html</A>.  It's put out by the
SuSE distribution of Linux and likely is about drivers available in
that distribution.  There is an isdn4linux package and a newsgroup:
de.alt.comm.isdn4linux.  Many of the postings are in German.  You
might try using a search engine (such as DejaNews) to find
"isdn4linux".
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss24.3">24.3 Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)</A>
</H2>

<P> DSL uses the existing twisted pair line from your home (etc.) to
the local telephone office.  This can be used if your telephone line
can accept higher speeds than an ordinary modem (say 56k) sends over
it.  It replaces the analog-to-digital converter at the local
telephone office with a converter which can accept a much faster flow
of data (in a different format of course).  The device which converts
the digital signals from your computer to the signal used to represent
digital data on the local telephone line is also called a modem.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss24.4">24.4 56k Digital-Modems</A>
</H2>

<P> For any 56k modem to work as a 56k modem in your home or office
the other end must be connected directly to the digital system of the
telephone company.  Thus ISPs at the other end of the line must obtain
special digital modems to provide customers with 56k service.  There's
more to it than this since banks of many modems are multiplexed onto a
high capacity telephone cable that transports a large number of phone
calls simultaneously (such as a T1, E1, ISDN PRI, or better line).
This requires a concentrator or "remote access server".  This has
usually been done by stand-alone units (like PC's but they cost much
more and have proprietary OSs).  Now there are some cards one may
insert into a PC's PCI bus to do this.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss24.5">24.5 Leased Line Modems</A>
</H2>

<P> These are analog and not digital modems.  These special modems are
used on lines leased from the telephone company or sometimes on just a
long direct wire hookup.  Ordinary modems for a telephone line will
not normally work on such a line.  An ordinary telephone line has
about 40-50 volts (know as the "battery) on it when not in use and the
conventional modem uses this voltage for transmission.  Furthermore,
the telephone company has special signals indicating a ring, line busy,
etc.  Conventional modems expect and respond to these signals.
Connecting two such modems by a long cable will not provide the
telephone signals on the cable and thus the modems will not work. 
<P>A common type of leased line used two pairs of wires (one for each
direction) using V.29 modulation at 9600 baud.  Some brands of leased
line modems are incompatible with other brands.
