<P>This document addresses the ordering, installation and configuration
of ADSL service for use on Linux Systems.  
<P>
<P>ADSL or Asymmetric Digital
Subscriber Loop is a high-speed  Internet access technology that
uses a commonly available telephone copper loop (same wire as
your phone service).  Designed to run on up to 80% of the 
telephone available in the United States,  and utilizing
line-adaptive modulation,  ADSL provides data speeds from 
384kbps to 1.5 Mbps, normally using different speeds for
the upstream and downstream channel (hence the
&quot; Asymmetric&quot; ).  ADSL provides a direct, dedicated
pipe to an ISP.
<P>
<P>ADSL was designed for SOHO applications, such as a small business
with 5-30 systems, or the high-end Linux user that has 
wants bandwidth and has some money to spend.   Applications range from
low-bandwidth server interconnection to streaming video applications. 
ADSL is designed and priced somewhere in between ISDN and T1 service,
providing near T1 speeds without the cost/complexity/availability issues
of T1.  Since ADSL is a dedicated service, it avoids the
delays and use charges inherent in ISDN service.
<P>This HOW-TO starts with a description of ADSL services and
it many variants, and a block diagram of the components that
make up the service.  Next, a list of requirements
for ordering ADSL are provided.  Also included is guide on ADSL wiring
and configuring your Linux System.  I have also included 
an Appendix with a FAQ, a listing of interesting Links,and a Glossary.
