<P>Some unused piece of delicious hardware floating around on my desk.
Screaming to be used. 40 Mb's of
ram and a 403 PPC inside. 
<P>So I decided to give it a try and connect it to my local Linux network. 
I want to thank the company I work for because they gave me the chance 
to experiment with it.
<P>In this (Mini-Howto) we'll be dealing with an IBM Network Station model
8361-100, other models may be featured in the future.
<P>It`s trying to describe how I setup the NC, there are probably lots of
other ways to set up this machine, this one works fine.
Any other remarks you might have from your own experience is welcome.
(Free Hardware also ;-))
<P>This MINI Howto is not trying to be the Bible on NC's and Linux, its
trying to be something for you to get started from nowhere.  Contributions
to this NC are welcome 
<P>
<P>
<P>Things we still have to implement in this Howto
<UL>
<LI>How to export your homedir</LI>
<LI>How to run applications</LI>
<LI>How to run Java Applets</LI>
</UL>
