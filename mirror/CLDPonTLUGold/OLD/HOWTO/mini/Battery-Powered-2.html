<P>
<P>This section describes a few technical things about laptop
batteries and some general power saving tips. This information
is not Linux-specific and if you are experienced with
laptops, you might already know all this.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Be kind to your battery</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>(Please note the 
<A HREF="Battery-Powered-5.html#credits">credits</A> for this
section.)
<P>
<P>There are currently three types of batteries commonly used
for portable computers.
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>NiCd</EM> batteries were the standard technology for years, but
today they are out of date and new laptops don't use them
anymore. They are heavy and very prone to the
``memory effect''. When recharging a NiCd battery that has not
been fully discharged, it ``remembers'' the old charge and
continues there the next time you use it.<P>
<P>The memory effect is caused by crystallization of the
battery's substances and can permanently reduce your battery's
lifetime, even make it useless. To avoid it, you should
completely discharge the battery and then fully recharge it again
at least once every few weeks.
<P>
<P>(A sidenote about the memory effect. James Youngman knows of a rather
drastic method to - uhm - ``repair'' batteries: ``If your NiCd
battery is suffering from the memory effect, remove it from your
computer, hold it about 30cm above a desk or the floor, and drop
it (make sure it lands flat).'' He says that this will break the
whiskers that have formed in the battery and that are the cause of
the memory effect if your battery is already affected
by it. ``I don't know if this works for non-NiCd batteries or not.'')
<P>Cadmium is a very hazardous poison, but if returned
to your dealer, the material can almost be fully recycled.
<P>
<P>Just in case you might be interested, here are some specs for NiCd:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Cell voltage: 1,2 V
Energy / mass: 40 Wh/kg
Energy / volume: 100 Wh/l
max. Energy: 20 Wh
Charge temp.: 10 to 35 C (50 to 95 F)
Discharge temp.: -20 to 50 C (-5 to 120 F)
Storage temp.: 0 to 45 C (30 to 115 F)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>NiMh</EM> batteries are the current standard used in most low
price laptops to date. They can be made smaller and are less
affected by the memory effect than NiCd.<P>
<P>However, they have problems at very high or low room
temperatures. And even though they use less hazardous
and non-poisonous substances, they cannot be fully
recycled yet (but this will probably change in the future).
<P>
<P>NiMh specs:
<P>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>The new high performance batteries use <EM>LiIon</EM>
technology. In theory, there is no memory effect at all
with these batteries, but on occasion, they seem to have similar
problems. Their substances are non-hazardous to the
enviroment, but they should be returned for recycling as well.<P>

<P>Even if the battery case looks the same, you cannot just
upgrade to another battery technology. The recharging
process is different for the kind of battery you use.
<P>
<P>Some
manufacturers integrate the recharging circuit inside the
laptop's external ac adapter, so you might just get away
with buying a new power supply to upgrade. A good
indication for an external recharging unit is when your ac
adapter uses a proprietary connector with a lot of power
lines.
<P>
<P>Other manufacturers
put the recharging unit inside the laptop case where users
cannot simply replace it with a newer technology. If
your ac adapter only uses two power lines to connect to
the computer (just like mine), the recharging unit is
probably inside the laptop.
<P>
<P>When in doubt, ask your manufacturer
if your laptop supports a more modern battery.
<P>
<P>A battery that is not used for a long time will
slowly discharge itself. And even with greatest care, a
battery needs to be replaced after 500 to 1000
recharges. But still it is not recommended to run a laptop
without the battery while on ac power - the battery often
serves as a big capacitor to protect against voltage peaks
from your ac outlet.
<P>
<P>As the manufacturers change the shapes of their batteries
every few months, you might have problems to find a new
battery for your laptop in a few years from now. Buy a
spare battery now - before it's out of stock.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Power saving - The obvious stuff</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are some obvious things that you can do to reduce your system's
power consumption. Well, maybe not so obvious, since not very many
people follow these rules...
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Decrease or turn off your display's backlight when you
don't need it. By the way, tft displays use more power than
dstn (so now you have a fine excuse why you bought the cheaper
laptop...).<P>
<P>(David Bateman tells me that using a crt screen while on battery and
turning off the laptop display will extend battery time by about 30%:
``Not that this is a very useful piece of knowledge though, if you've
got the crt plugged in then why not the laptop too.'')
<P>
</LI>
<LI>How much processing power do you really need? I doubt that
you will be doing very much more than text editing when on
the road (well, at least I don't compile linux kernels then). While
on battery, reducing the cpu clock speed will decrease power
consumption, too. Quite a few laptops offer a cpu clock
selector that will toggle between normal and slow speed.<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Turn off the cpu cooler (if you have one). Many recent laptops
offer a bios option called ``cooling control''. If your
system's cpu is becoming too hot, this option allows you to
have it cooled by a tiny fan (setting ``performance'') or
to have its cpu clock slowed down (setting ``silence''). To
increase your uptime while on battery, use ``silence''.<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Avoid using external devices (printer, crt screen, zip drive, portable
camera etc.) with your computer while on battery. When
connected to a standard ink jet printer, my laptop's
battery time is reduced from up to 120 minutes down to
20 minutes.<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Avoid using any built in device unless necessairy: Diskette
drive, harddisk, cd-rom. Especially cd-rom access will
dramatically decrease your battery time.<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Pcmcia cards can also consume a lot of power, so don't
leave your modem or network adapter plugged in when it
is not in use. But this is different between the various
pcmcia manufacturers, so check the product specs before you buy
(e. g. some cards never turn themselves off even when
not in use).<P>
<P>(By the way, I recently read that pcmcia cards are the
biggest problem for windows ce palmtops - they drain so
much power that the tiny machines' little batteries have
to be replaced within minutes...)
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use simple software. A full blown multimedia application
will create a lot more system load and harddisk / cd-rom
activity than a small simple word processor.<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Grant Taylor has a tip for those of us who want to upgrade
their system: ``Newer versions of some upgradable components
consume less power. For example, IBM's Travelstar 2.5 inch 1.6
gigabyte ide harddisk drive consumes 20 percent less than the
500 megabyte toshiba harddisk my laptop came with.''<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>If you are yet about to buy a laptop - don't buy a laptop
with a 2nd level cache if battery uptime is important. A
computer with 2nd level cache is about 10% to 20% faster
and it will be a lot better with multimedia
applications and number crunching, but it consumes a lot of
power. Bjoern Kriews tells me that he has two almost
identical laptops and the one without cache ram runs
4h30 compared to 2h30 with cache.<P>
<P>If you already have 2nd level cache installed, turning
it off will probably not help you very much.
Give it a try and write me about your experience.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Another tip for those still buying a laptop - don't buy the
latest, fastest cpu type. Usually, the older generations are
optimized by the manufacturer after some time without
notice. The ``new'' versions of old cpu types often create
less heat and consume less power than the product's
premiere version.<P>
<P>There are also frankenstein laptops
available that use cpus not optimized for portable systems. As
I wrote this in May 97, the newest generation pentium-200
laptops ran about 20 minutes on battery and became so hot that
they burnt your lap. When writing the second revision
in Oct 97, pentium-233 laptops run two hours
or longer without ac power. Go figure.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Well, you get the idea. Most of these are restrictions
that will probably stop you from doing any serious work
with your Linux system. (The best way to save power
while on battery is... not to do anything at all. That
increases my laptop's battery uptime by almost 100 percent.)
<P>
<P>So let's go ahead to some other, more useful measures that will
save power without disturbing your work.
<P>
