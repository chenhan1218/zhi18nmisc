<P>If you have not already ran ``<CODE>netconfig</CODE>'' on your system, do so now.  
Setup your machine just as if it were on Ethernet.
<P>Edit your <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</CODE> scripts to point to the <CODE>tr0</CODE>
device rather than the <CODE>eth0</CODE> device.  
<P>You should have a line that looks like
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} broadcast ${BROADCAST} netmask ${NETMASK}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Change this line to read
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/sbin/ifconfig tr0 ${IPADDR} broadcast ${BROADCAST} netmask ${NETMASK}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 RedHat 4.0+</A>
</H2>

<P>The RedHat distribution of Linux has a wonderful Xwindows control panel
for configuring modules and devices. If you have added a token ring adapter
to a standard RedHat installation, there should already be token ring support
compiled in as a module.
Try to:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
modprobe ibmtr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and see what you come up with.
Chances are, if you have a supported adapter, you will be ready to go.
<P>The easiest way to configure your interface would be to use the control-panel.
You will first want to go to the kernel module control and instruct it
to load a new network device for token ring.
It should then start to autoload the ibmtr driver on boot.
You will then want to jump over to network configuration and add a new device,
<CODE>tr</CODE>, and give it an ip address, etc.
<P>You should then be able to restart and go with Linux and Token Ring
on RedHat 4.0+.
<P>Please note that these RedHat instructions came from the top of my head.
I havn't had to modify any of my RedHat systems for quite some time and
am writing this from memory.
Either way, they should be able to get you where you need to go.
