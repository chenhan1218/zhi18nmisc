<P>The international keyboard Xmodmap HOWTO. Copyright (C) 1999, 2001 Juraj Sipos 
(xvudpapc@savba.sk). Imagine you use a Linux or BSD OS and want to write 
a business letter to a person that has a foreign name with a slash or 
idiaresis. Danish language uses signs like ø and Spanish like ñ.
<P>
<P> 
This is the Xmodmap Howto. With this information you can make your 
own international keyboard layout without installing any additional 
packages. The following information will help you set up German, 
Spanish, Italian, Slovak, Czech, Polish, Slovenian, Croatian, Danish, 
Dutch, French, Finnish, Norwegian, Estonian, Latvian, Swedish and 
other keyboards. You can also alternatively look at my homepage 
at 
<A HREF="http://freebsd.nfo.sk/">http://freebsd.nfo.sk</A> 
to see layouts of various keyboards. In case you want to install 
Greek, Hebrew or Russian language, follow my information and apply 
changes pertinent to these languages also with respect to other 
documentation (e.g., install Greek fonts, etc., see the Cyrillic, 
Hebrew, or Danish howto). This howto does not cover the 
/etc/X11/XF86Config file XKB configuration and don't mail me with 
questions regarding this matter. There are other howtos in Linux 
Documentation project, so please look there.
