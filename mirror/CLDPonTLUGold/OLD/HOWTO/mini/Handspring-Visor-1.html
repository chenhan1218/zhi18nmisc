<P>I recieved my Handvisor today, and have struggled getting it to work,
and found no good HOWTO yet, so thought i'd make one. By some random
mutation, you might be able to find a new version on my web page, 
but that is up to chance. Test your luck at:

check has yet been run on this document. So, if you have a problem 
with my spellling, tuff luck.

<P>Hmm... what did I claim? Oh well. I am really a newbie at this 
usb/visor stuff, so i really couldn't answer to many of your questions.
There are people who could help you much better, who maintain the

<P>I actually "lost" my machine with USB capabilities, so I am no
longer able to test the USB stuff out. It would be very nice if
people could send in documentation on how to get PPP connections
working. (Or any other related cool thing working).
