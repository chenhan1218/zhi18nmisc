<P>This document describes how to easily use a combination of 
Windows 95's Boot Menu and Loadlin.exe to autoboot Linux using 
the F4 Function Key. This procedure should work with Windows 95 
versions 4.00.950, 4.00.950a, and 4.00.95b with FAT16, and all versions
of Linux that support Loadlin. If you prefer to use the LILO boot
manager, please consult the 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Linux+Win95.html">Linux+Win95 Mini-HOWTO</A>.
<P>There are also two alternate methods for dual booting between Linux
and Windows 95 using Loadlin for users using FAT32 with Windows 95
version 4.00.950b.
