<P>This is not the first release of this mini-HOWTO. I
hope to improve it whenever possible. Beside that,
there are other documents that may help you to
use amateur radio stuff on your computer. You may
look for AX.25 (mini-)HOWTO at the same location
where you get FBB mini-HOWTO.
<P><EM>This mini-HOWTO would be improved from time 
to time. If you think that the HOWTO on your 
Linux installation CD is some out-of-date, you
may check for newest release on the Internet. It
could be found within the main

homepage.</EM>

<!--
disk!information resources!HOWTOs

These are intended as the primary starting points to
get the background information as well as show you how to solve
a specific problem.
Some relevant HOWTOs are <CODE>Bootdisk</CODE>, <CODE>Installation</CODE>,  <CODE>SCSI</CODE> and <CODE>UMSDOS</CODE>.
The main site for these is the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/">LDP archive</A>
at Metalab (formerly known as Sunsite).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Mini-HOWTO</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!information resources!mini-HOWTOs
-->

These are the smaller free text relatives to the HOWTOs.
Some relevant mini-HOWTOs are
<CODE>Backup-With-MSDOS</CODE>, <CODE>Diskless</CODE>, <CODE>LILO</CODE>, <CODE>Large Disk</CODE>,
<CODE>Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2</CODE>, <CODE>Linux+OS2+DOS</CODE>, <CODE>Linux+Win95</CODE>,
<CODE>Linux+WinNT</CODE>, <CODE>Linux+NT-Loader</CODE>, <CODE>NFS-Root</CODE>, <CODE>Win95+Win+Linux</CODE>,
<CODE>ZIP Drive</CODE>, <CODE>FBB packet-radio BBS</CODE>.
You can find these at the same place as the HOWTOs, usually in a sub directory
called <CODE>mini</CODE>. Note that these are scheduled to be converted into SGML and
become proper HOWTOs in the near future.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7 Local Resources</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--

In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory installed,
have a look in the
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc">/usr/doc</A> directory.
where most packages store their main documentation and README files etc.
Also you will here find the HOWTO archive (
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO">/usr/doc/HOWTO</A>)
of ready formatted HOWTOs
and also the mini-HOWTO archive (
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini">/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini</A>)
of plain text documents.
<P>Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in the
<A HREF="file:///etc">/etc</A>
directory. In particular you will want to work with the
<A HREF="file:///etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</A>
file that sets up the mounting of partitions
and possibly also
<A HREF="file:///etc/mdtab">/etc/mdtab</A>
file that is used for the <CODE>md</CODE> system to set up RAID.
<P>The kernel source in
<A HREF="file:///usr/src/linux">/usr/src/linux</A>
is, of course, the ultimate documentation. In other
words, <EM>use the source, Luke</EM>.
It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only with
source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
but also an informative
<A HREF="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation">documentation directory</A>.
If you are about to ask any questions about the kernel you should
read this first, it will save you and many others a lot of time
and possibly embarrassment.
<P>Also have a look in your system log file (
<A HREF="file:///var/log/messages">/var/log/messages</A>)
to see what is going on and in particular how the booting went if
too much scrolled off your screen. Using <CODE>tail -f /var/log/messages</CODE>
in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update of what is
going on in your system.
<P>You can also take advantage of the 
<A HREF="file:///proc">/proc</A>
file system that is a window into the inner workings of your system.
Use <CODE>cat</CODE> rather than <CODE>more</CODE> to view the files as they are 
reported as being zero length. Reports are that <CODE>less</CODE> works well here.

</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!information resources!WWW

<!--
disk!information resources!web pages
-->

There is a huge number of informative web pages out there and by their very
nature they change quickly so don't be too surprised if these links become
quickly outdated.
<P>A good starting point is of course the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A> home page,
an information central for documentation, project pages and much, much more.
<P>Please let me know if you have any other leads that can be of interest.
