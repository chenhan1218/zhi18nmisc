<H2><A NAME="s4">4. System Configuration</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Hardware Installation</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>(Thanks to William Burrow for this section.)</EM>
<P>If you are afraid to open the case of your computer, be sure to read over this 
entire HOWTO first and make notes about the card, such as its tuner
type, integrated circuit numbers, the frequencies of the crystal(s) and so on. 
Then get someone competent to install the card for you. 
<P>Otherwise, open the case and install the card in an available slot. Pick one 
that supports PCI bus transfers and PCI bus mastering, if your mainboard
is picky about this (see your mainboard's manual). You will want this for 
overlay mode. 
<P>For sound, there are two different ways to connect your video grabber card 
and your sound card. One way is internal routing. Connect your CD-ROM
audio cable to the video card sound input and the video card output to the 
sound card CD-ROM or Tuner audio input. Another way is to connect the external
1/8'' audio jack on the video card to the audio card's 1/8'' line audio in 
jack. You can also just plug amplified speakers into the grabber card audio out
if you do not have an audio card or don't want to route through the sound card. 
(A few of the newer bt878 cards don't have any sound connector, because they
send digital audio data across the PCI bus.  There is no support for this at
the time of this writing.)
<P>A video source is also handy, especially for determining if the card is 
working or not. Many cards handle composite video in, S-Video in and, if
equipped with a tuner, RF in. There is a separate connector for each 
of these inputs.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Kernel Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Your kernel will need to be correctly configured to support your card.
Most newer Linux distributions come with the necessary
modules already compiled, so if you can find the <CODE>videodev.o</CODE>, 
<CODE>bttv.o</CODE>, and <CODE>tuner.o</CODE> under <CODE>/lib/modules/2.x.x/misc</CODE>, 
you should be ready to go.
<P>
<P>If not, you'll need to recompile your kernel with
<P><CODE>CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV</CODE>
<P>and
<P><CODE>CONFIG_VIDEO_BT848</CODE>
<P>enabled, preferably as loadable modules.  See the Linux Kernel HOWTO (
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html</A>) for details on recompiling your kernel.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Using the updated 0.6.x packages</A>
</H2>

<P>If you want to use the updated 0.6.x package, you should first retrieve 
the archive from one of the sites mentioned above.  Extract it with
<P> 
<CODE>tar -xvzf bttv-0.6.x.tar.gz</CODE>
<P>and change to the newly created 
directory.  <CODE>su</CODE> to root, and type 
<P><CODE>make</CODE>
<P>in the main 
directory to create the drivers.  (You can safely ignore the information 
in the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> file about editing makefiles, and the like, since
we will pass this information to the driver as module parameters.) Then, type 
<P><CODE>make install</CODE>
<P>to install them.  Finally, run 
<P><CODE>/sbin/depmod -a</CODE>
<P>to update your module dependency information.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Special files in <CODE>/dev</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>Next, you may need to make the special character files in the <CODE>/dev</CODE>
directory.  Type <CODE>ls /dev/video*; ls /dev/radio*</CODE> to see if these
devices already exist.  If not, you'll need to create them.  All of the 
files have major device number 81, and the minor device numbers depend
on the specific device (video, radio, etc.) as well as multiple instances
of these files.  See the Video4Linux API 
(
<A HREF="http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4lapi.shtml">http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4lapi.shtml</A>) 
for the programming-related details.
<P>
<P>
<P>There is a <CODE>MAKEDEV</CODE> script in the <CODE>driver</CODE> directory 
of the bttv driver package which will create four video devices for 
you.  You can also do it yourself fairly easily if you only have one video
capture card.
As root, type:
<P><CODE>mknod /dev/video0 c 81 0</CODE>
<P><CODE>chmod 666 /dev/video0</CODE>
<P><CODE>ln -s /dev/video0 /dev/video</CODE>
<P>
<P><CODE>mknod /dev/radio0 c 81 64</CODE>
<P><CODE>chmod 666 /dev/radio0</CODE>
<P><CODE>ln -s /dev/radio0 /dev/radio</CODE>
<P>
<P>
<P>There are also videotext and VBI devices which can be created if you have an
application which needs them.  (Currently, there are only a few.)  Type:
<P><CODE>mknod /dev/vtx0 c 81 192</CODE>
<P><CODE>chmod 666 /dev/vtx0</CODE>
<P><CODE>ln -s /dev/vtx0 /dev/vtx</CODE>
<P>
<P><CODE>mknod /dev/vbi0 c 81 224</CODE>
<P><CODE>chmod 666 /dev/vbi0</CODE>
<P><CODE>ln -s /dev/vbi0 /dev/vbi</CODE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Loading the Modules</A>
</H2>

<P>The bttv driver provides many different modules, with many different options,
as described in the appendix of this document.  With so many modules 
and options, you may wish to do this by hand until
you get everything working.   On the off chance that this causes your box
to crash, it wouldn't hurt to type
<P><CODE>sync; sleep 1; sync</CODE>
<P>to flush any dirty disk buffers before proceeding.  Then, using the 
<CODE>insmod</CODE> command as root, try
loading up the modules.  The first two are easy, because they don't usually need
any options:
<P><CODE>insmod videodev</CODE>
<P><CODE>insmod i2c</CODE>
<P>Now you're ready to load the bttv module itself:
<P><CODE>modprobe bttv</CODE>
<P>By default, the <CODE>bttv</CODE> module attempts to autodetect your card type.
Watch <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE> to see what it finds.  If it doesn't
autodetect properly,
you can add the <CODE>card=<EM>n</EM></CODE> option to the end of the previous command
to force a card type, with 
<CODE><EM>n</EM></CODE> chosen from the following list.  (Types 0 through 19 are provided
in the kernel series driver, bttv-0.6.4h contains support for types 20 through 27)
You can also add the 
<CODE>radio=1</CODE> option if your card has FM tuner functionality.
<P>

<P>Next, load the tuner module, with
<P><CODE>modprobe tuner type=<EM>n</EM></CODE>
<P>You will probably need to dig into your case to see which tuner you have.  Some
cards (Miro and Hauppauge) allow the tuner to be automatically detected, but 
you may need to specify it.  The tuner should be marked with the brand name,
and you can look at the crystals (little aluminum cans) on the board to see if
you have an NTSC or a PAL tuner.  For PAL, the crystal is marked 28.xxxMHz 
(where xxx are three digits). For NTSC, the canister should say 35.xxxMHz.
Once you have identified your tuner, select the value of <CODE><EM>n</EM></CODE> from 
the following list (types 8 and 9 are included only in bttv-0.6.4h):
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
type=n          type of the tuner chip. n as follows:
                0: Temic PAL tuner
                1: Philips PAL_I tuner
                2: Philips NTSC tuner
                3: Philips SECAM tuner
                4: no tuner
                5: Philips PAL tuner
                6: Temic NTSC tuner
                7: Temic PAL tuner
                8: Alps TSBH1 NTSC tuner
                9: Alps TSBE1 PAL tuner
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>Finally, insert any sound modules you may need.  Again, you will probably
need to take a very close look at the card to see what you've got.  
Note that drivers for TEA6300, TDA8425, TDA9855, and DPL3518 chips are 
only included in the 0.6.4h series driver, and are not included with 
the current (2.2.14) kernel drivers.
<P>
<P><CODE>modprobe msp3400</CODE> or <CODE>tea3600</CODE> or <CODE>tda8425</CODE> or
<CODE>tda9855</CODE> or <CODE>dpl3518</CODE>(see the appendix for details and options)
<P>Fire up your favorite video4linux program, and see if it works.  If you
can't change the channel, make sure you have inserted the correct tuner
module.  If you can't hear any sound, double check the sound module, and
make sure that the channel is not muted, if you're running the audio through
your sound card.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Automating the process </A>
</H2>

<P>After you know which modules and options you need, you can automate the 
process by putting the information into <CODE>/etc/conf.modules</CODE>.  Then, running an 
application which needs the driver will cause it to be loaded automatically. 
I use the following:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
# TV
alias   char-major-81   bttv
pre-install bttv        modprobe -k tuner; modprobe -k msp3400
options bttv            radio=1 card=3
options tuner           type=2
</PRE>
<HR>

Be sure change this to reflect the proper modules and options for your particular card.
(Run an <CODE>/sbin/depmod -a</CODE> to make sure all your module dependency information
is up to date, as well.)
