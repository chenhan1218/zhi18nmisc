<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 ADSL Applications</A>
</H2>

<P>ADSL was designed to provide a dedicated, high-speed data connection for
Internet/Intranet Access, using existing copper phone lines.  This allows
ADSL to work on over 60-80% of the phone lines existing in
the U.S. without modification.  
Additionally, ADSL provides speeds approaching T1 (1.5Mbps), which
are much greater than analog modems (56kbps) or ISDN (128kbps) services
provided over the same type of line.  
ADSL is usually priced to be much less other dedicated digital 
services, and is expected to priced somewhere between T1 and
ISDN services (including the ISDN usage charges).
<P>The Telcos see ADSL as a competitive offering to the Cable Company's
Cable Modems, and as such, 
are expected to provide competitive pricing/configuration offerings.
Although Cable Modems  are advertised as having 10-30Mbps bandwidth,
they use a shared transmission medium with many other
users on the same line, and therefore performance varies, perhaps
greatly, with the amount of traffic and other users.
<P>
<P>ADSL is positioned for Home and Small Office (SOHO) applications that require
high-speed Internet Access. Since it also provides dedicated access,
It can be used for interconnecting low-bandwidth servers to the
Internet, and would provide a great access solution for
5-20 PCs in an Office location.  It is also a great solution
for those Linux power users that just want high speed access from home:-).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 What is xDSL/DSL?</A>
</H2>

<P>Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) provides a dedicated
digital circuit from your home to the Telcos central office, using
analog telephone line.  DSL also provides a separate channel for voice
phone conversations, which means analog calls (voice, fax. etc.) can be carried
at the same time high-speed data is flowing across the line.
DSL uses the frequency spectrum between 0kHz-4kHz for
Analog Voice, and 4kHz-2.2MHz for data.  xDSL is a generic
acronym for a family of dedicated services, where the &quot; x&quot;stands for:
<UL>
<LI><B>ADSL </B> 
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line:     1.5 Mbps-384kbps/384-128kbps </LI>
<LI><B>HDSL </B>
High-bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line:  1.5 Mbps/1.5 Mbps  (4Wire)</LI>
<LI><B>SDSL </B>
Single-line Digital Subscriber Line:    1.5 Mbps/1.5 Mbps  (2Wire)</LI>
<LI><B>VDSL </B>
Very high Digital Subscriber Line:      13 Mbps-52 Mbps/1.5 Mbps- 2.3 Mbps. </LI>
<LI><B>IDSL </B>
ISDN Digital Subscriber Line:   128 Kbps/128 Kbps. </LI>
<LI><B>RADSL </B>
Rate Adaptive Digital Subscriber Line:  384kbps/128kbps</LI>
<LI><B>UDSL </B>
Universal Digital Subscriber Line:   1.0Mbps-384kbps/384kbps-128kbps<BR>   
also called &quot; splitterless&quot; DSL or DSL-Lite, as it doesn't require
a splitter. </LI>
</UL>
<P>where Xbps/Ybps is X=Downstream Bit rate, Y=Upstream Bit rate
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Why so many speeds?</A>
</H2>

<P>ADSL has to work over existing phone lines, which were designed 
100 years ago, and were never designed for digital services (See
the FAQ answers for more information). Also, ADSL is a new service,
and all the providers are trying to find the right price/feature
combinations that will make it in the market.
<P>For the average user, the basic way of thinking about it is to 
segment the options into three categories:
<UL>
<LI><B>Low End Residential</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed ranges from 384kbps-128kbps, Asymmetric 
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>High End Residential or Business End User</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed ranges from 1.5Mbps-384kbps, Asymmetric
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>High End Server</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed ranges from +2.0Mbps-1.1kbps, Symmetric
<P>
</LI>
