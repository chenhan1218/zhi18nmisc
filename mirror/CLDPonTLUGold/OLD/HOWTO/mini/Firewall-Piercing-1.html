</H2>

<P>I haven't been actively developing this mini-HOWTO recently;
in particular, the french version is lagging behind.
I'm looking for a maintainer to take over this document,
and maybe develop software to make it easier to pierce firewalls.
I also have a lot of ideas for active maintainers
to expand this HOWTO, if anyone is interested.

<P>Even though the only thing left is the disclaimers,
this document owes a lot to the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Term-Firewall.html">Term-Firewall mini-HOWTO</A>
by 
<A HREF="mailto:bap@cs.unm.edu">Barak Pearlmutter</A>.
Barak's mini-HOWTO relies on
an ancient and no-more-supported program named Term
(a great program in its time,
and maybe still useful in some unhappy circumstances),
as well as on peculiarities of a not-so-standard telnet implementation,
that is, many obsolete and non-portable facts.
Nevertheless, there was a necessity for a mini-HOWTO about piercing firewalls,
and despite its shortcomings, his mini-HOWTO was a model and an encouragement.
<P>I'd also like to congratulate
<A HREF="mailto:lars@nocrew.org">Lars Brinkhoff</A>
and
<A HREF="mailto:logic@gore.nocrew.org">Magnus Lundström</A>
for their fine http, mail and icmp tunnels.
