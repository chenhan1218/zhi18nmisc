<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Setting up the news groups and news server (innd)</A></H2>

<P>Using ctlinnd, create the newsgroups on your news server. Remember,
these are to be local news groups, so start them with a distinctive
name so you can filter them out from your news distributions (in your
newsfeeds file).
<P>
<P>You also need to tell innd that the group is moderated (by using
ctlinnd). Remember, innd is very sensitive to file ownership and
permissions, so you need to interct at this level with innd as the
news user. Indicating a moderated group is done by specifying m to the
newgroup command.

<P>The m tells innd that the group is moderated.
<P>
<P>Edit your newsfeeds file to make sure that these local groups are not
distributed (unless you specificaly wish this to occur).
<P>
<P>For example, if your mailing list is called local.site.group, then you
would probably want to add !local* to the second field of your up (and
possibly your down) stream news sites in your newsfeeds file.
<P>
<P>Now, in order to ensure that user messages are sent to the list
automatically by innd, edit /etc/news/moderators to include a line
declaring the mailing list email address as the moderator.
