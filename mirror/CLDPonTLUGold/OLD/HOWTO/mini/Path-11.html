<P>
<P>magicfilter is a common tool to manipulate files for printer.  It
analyzes the type of the file to be printed and invokes a filter
script to make appropriate pretty-printing.  These scripts are invoked
from lpd that is started from /etc/init.d/lpd that is started from
init. Thus, the path is that of init. That does not contain
/usr/bin/X11!
<P>You might want to insert printing of PDF files to magicfilter.  It is
possible to do this by using /usr/bin/X11/xpdf.  Now you must remember
to insert full directory path to the file name because magicfilter
would not find it otherwise.  Most programs used in magicfilter do not
need full path, because they are on /bin or /usr/bin.

</H2>

<P>
<P>
<P>You may use PRINTER environment variable to show what is the printer
that you are using.  However, you may notice that in some cases in X
applications it is sometimes lost.
<P>You must remember that if the X session is started from XDM, the
window manager has never evaluated your shell login scripts.  All the
X applications that you have started from xterm have your PRINTER
variable.  However, if the same application is started from menu or
window manager button, it does not contain your PRINTER variable.
<P>In some cases this can be inherited to an even lower layer: for
example a Netscape helper application can have or have not your
PRINTER definition.
