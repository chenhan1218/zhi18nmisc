</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 CPE: ADSL ANT and NIC </A>
</H2>

<P>The Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) for ADSL consists of
the ANT and/or NIC card.
The ADSL Network Termination (ANT), shown in Figure 1,
is located at your home or office,
provides an IP connection. ANTs come in several types:
<UL>
<LI> Router ANT with 10/100baseT Interface </LI>
<LI> Bridge ANT with 10/100baseT Interface </LI>
<LI> ANT with ATMF Interface</LI>
<LI> ANT with USB Interface </LI>
<LI> Integrated ANT/NIC Card </LI>
</UL>
<P>In each case, the ANT/NIC  provides the 
a router address to an ISP.  Each Telco will specify the configurations
that they will allow.  The most desirable configuration for the Linux
user is the ANT with a 10baseT Interface, since the cost/setup 
is the easiest. The other options require special drivers, which
have, to date, not been made available for Linux. The bad news is that
some providers  allow only integrated ANT/NIC PCI cards
that do not have Linux Drivers. 
<P><B>Warning!</B>  Make sure any third party ANT/NIC you may
purchase are compatible with your Telco provider. There are two
major line encodings for ADSL (CAP, DMT), and several options
for IP encapsulation. Your Telco should provide you a list of
allowable options.
<P>The ANT is connected to 
your house's inside wire (2 wire phone line). This inside wire
is connected to the data side of a POTS splitter, or, in the case of the
splitterless version, directly connected to the local loop.
Figure 1 shows the POTS splitter wiring, and Figure 2 shows a
splitterless type.
<P>In my case, I was provided with an Alcatel ANT, which supports
a 10baseT (wired as a Crossover) RJ45 jack. I understand that
a NIC card that fits directly in the PC will be available sometime
in the future.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Splitter or Splitterless Design</A>
</H2>

<P>Somehow, the digital and analog signals need to be
separated  for all of this to work. Thus, a filter
needs to be placed in the signal path at some point.
There are two methods for doing this: Using a POTS
Splitter or using RJ11 phone jack filters.
<P>First, in the POTS splitter method,
device  is located on the "side of the house" where
the Telco line is connected. The splitter provides two 
functions. First, it is the "demarcation point" that separates
the Telco wiring from the inside wiring. Second, it "splits"
the DSL signal from Telco into a separated data channel
and a voice channel.  The voice channel is a normal analog
phone line (2 wire), and the data channel is sent to the
ANT.  The splitter is a passive, non-powered device,
which will allow the voice channel to operate even if the 
power fails at the home location. The Telco signal is sent
to the splitter using an existing 2 wire line to the home.
The Splitter is housed in the Network Interface Device (NID) on
the outside of your house.
<P>Second, in the splitterless design, shown in Figure 2, 
the outside local loop
is connected directly to the inside wire at the Subscriber
Network Interface (SNI), the same box that is used today
at your house. At each extension jack where you wish to
plug in an analog phone, you place a special jack that
contains a filter that removes the digital signal. This
is called an RJ11 filter (RJ11 is the official Telco term used for your
4/6 pin phone jack).  The extension used for your ANT does NOT
use a filter (otherwise it won't work).  That's all
there is to it!  It should also be noted that
some low speed ADSLs will  not require RJ-11 filters.
<P>The splitterless design is very desirable from the Telco 
point of view, as they won't have to roll any trucks to 
do the install work, and allows them to offer ADSL at 
a lower price. For most users, it doesn't really matter,
in fact, the analog phones will still work without the RJ11
filter in place. The only thing is that you will hear
a bit of a high pitched whine when you use the phone.
However, this is not recommended, as later version may damage
the phone or have some other nasty effect. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 DSLAM</A>
</H2>

<P>The DSLAM is the equipment at the Telco Central Office that
that splits the signal and connects the user to the Voice
Switch and ISP. That's all you need to know from a user
perspective.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 ISP connection</A>
</H2>

<P>An ISP connects to the DSLAM via a high-speed data connection,
usually ATM over a T3 (45Mbps) or OC-3 (155Mbps). 
The important thing here is that an ISP must "subscribe" with your Telco to provide
this connection.
