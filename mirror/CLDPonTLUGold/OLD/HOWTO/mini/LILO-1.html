<P>Although the documentation found in Lilo's sources (the one installed
in <CODE>/usr/doc/lilo</CODE>-version) is very comprehensive, most Linux
users experience some trouble in building their own
<CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> file. This document is meant to support them
by giving the minimal information and by showing five sample
installations:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The first example is the classical ``Linux and other'' installation.
</LI>
<LI>The next one shows how to install Lilo on a hard drive
connected as <CODE>/dev/hdc</CODE> that will boot as <CODE>/dev/hda</CODE>.
This is usually needed when you install a new Linux drive from
your own running system. This also tells how to boot from SCSI
disks when your BIOS is modern enough.
</LI>
<LI>The third example shows how to boot a Linux system whose root
partition can't be accessed by the BIOS.
</LI>
<LI>The next sample file is used to access huge disks, that neither the
BIOS nor DOS can access easily (this one is somehow outdated).
</LI>
<LI>The last example shows how to restore a damaged disk,
if the damage resulted from installing another
operating system).
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The last three examples are by Cameron, <CODE>cls@truffula.sj.ca.us</CODE>,
who wrote the original document. Alessandro <CODE>rubini@linux.it</CODE>
doesn't run anything but Linux, so he can't check
nor update them by himself. Needless to say, any feedback is welcome.
