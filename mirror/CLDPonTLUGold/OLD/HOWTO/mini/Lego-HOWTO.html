   Revision History
   Revision 1.1 October 29th, 2000
   
   The Lego Group's Mindstorm Robotics Invention System (RIS) is probably
   the best reasonably cheap robotics kit available. However, the
   standard software is (unsurprisingly) MS Windows dependent. Don't
   despair- there are several options that allow Linux users to use their
   Mindstorms from within Linux. This Mini-HOWTO is intended to serve as
   a very brief introduction to the options available, and as a gathering
   point for more information.

1. Introduction

   If you've seen those cool Lego Mindstorms kits, but despaired at the
   big "requires Windows" stickers on the side, don't despair: there is
   hope for you yet. Not only is there software that allows you to
   program your RCX from GNU/Linux, odds are you can do it in your
   favorite languages: C, Perl, Java and Forth are all available for your
   use. This document is not intended as documentation for all of these:
   rather, I hope to provide highlights and contact information for each
   of the various Linux options, so that this document can serve as a
   starting point for Linux users who are considering purchasing
   Mindstorms kits, or for Mindstorms owners who are considering
   switching to Linux and wonder whether or not they can continue to use
   their most expensive toys :)
   
   It is extremely important to note that while I try to keep a pretty
   good finger on the pulse of the online Mindstorms community, I'm not
   omniscient: it's quite possible that this list is incomplete. If you
   know of other Mindstorms options that run on Linux, please drop me a
   note at [76]luge@users.sourceforge.netso that I can add to the
   document and share the options with others who may be considering
   buying a Mindstorms to use with their GNU/Linux computers.

1.1. Acknowledgements

   I'd like to thank the authors of the programs listed below, both for
   writing them in the first place for all of us to use and also for
   giving the earliest version of this document a once-over.
   
   Additionally, I'd like to thank Dave Baum, who asked me to join with
   him in writing the book "Extreme Mindstorms". Writing that let me
   spend a lot of time with the Mindstorms that I wouldn't have had
   otherwise, including the time that led to this HOWTO. If you are
   interested in exploring "power programming" for the RCX, I'd strongly
   suggest this book. There are some other good books out there (notably
   the O'Reilly book) but this one is extremely up to date, and more
   importantly, just about every line of code in it (as far as I know)
   will work with Linux. I know this is a pretty shameless plug, but I'm
   pretty proud of it :) You can buy the book [77]here.
   
   Also, Steve Baker and Matthew Miller, and many others on Lugnet,
   provided many helpful suggestions to several early versions of this
   text. Their thoughts are present in several places throughout the
   text, and can be assumed to be responsible for all the good stuff. :)
   
   Finally, thought not direcly related, Michael Littman, formerly of
   Duke University and now of AT&T actually paid me to play with LEGO
   last summer. Without the opportunity that he gave me, I would not be
   as involved or as knowledgeable with the online Mindstorms community
   as I now am.

2. The Mindstorms Architecture

2.1. The Basic Hardware

   In case you don't know, the Lego Mindstorms Kit is a robotics kit from
   The Lego Group that retails for about 200 US dollars. For that, you
   get a lot of Lego pieces, a large brick containing a CPU, an LCD, and
   some connectors (known as the RCX), a couple of motors, and some light
   and touch sensors that allow you to interact with the outside world.
   
   The current release of the RCX kit is version 1.5, which will be
   replaced in spring 2001 by RCX 2.0. For the time being, any time I say
   "RCX" in this document, I mean "RCX 1.x." The differences between 1.0
   and 1.5 are minimal, but the changes between 1.5 and 2.0 may be
   substantial- the exact extent of the changes is not yet known.
   
   If you want to learn about the hardware in more detail (think:
   excruciating detail, from folks who have literally disassembled their
   RCX's in order to see what makes them tick) there are two important
   web sites to visit: [82]Russell Nelson's Lego Mindstorms Internals and
   [83]Kekoa Proudfoot's RCX Internals. Without these two sites, it is
   unlikely that much of the software below would exist.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.2. Standard RCX Programming

   The key to understanding the various Linux options is to first
   understand how the Mindstorms kit operates normally with MS Windows.
   In a nutshell, Lego provides a MS Windows software tool that lets you
   (or, more likely, a 12-14 year old) graphically assemble programs for
   the Mindstorm, using a building-block metaphor to create code. Once
   the program has been "assembled" in this way, the software compiles
   your program into a byte-code. This byte-code is then downloaded to
   the robot, where the firmware of the RCX processes the byte-code and
   controls the machine based on the instructions in the byte-code.
   Besides parsing byte-code, the RCX firmware has many OS-like
   functions: it controls the hardware, threading, and in particular,
   controls the IR port that is used to communicate with the robot. It
   also has the ability to accept specific commands (as opposed to
   complete programs) from the IR port or a special remote control, and
   move the robot based on those commands.
   
   The standard firmware is currently in version 1.0 (even if you buy it
   with RIS version 1.5). It has pretty serious limitations- for example,
   since each variable is stored in a register and not in RAM, there can
   be only 32 variables. However, you can still do some pretty cool stuff
   with it, and version 2.0 of the firmware (which is available now for
   beta from [84]LEGO) will significantly reduce these restrictions as
   well as be reverse compatible with 1.x hardware.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3. Where the Linux Tools Fit In

   The different Linux Mindstorms programs function as replacments for
   different portions of the software chain discussed in the previous
   section. Some completely replace the default firmware with their own
   OS-like system or language interpreter. Others generate byte-code that
   matches the standard Lego byte-code, and use the standard firmware to
   interpret the byte-code once it has been generated. Finally, some
   merely generate the remote control codes that allow you to control the
   robot from the host PC, without giving you the option to run anything
   on the robot itself. These also use the standard Lego firmware.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.4. Hardware Requirements for the Linux Host

   Since most of these tools are command line based, hardware
   requirements are minimal- basically any Linux system should run them.
   
   The one exception is the serial port, which must be present and may
   not be on some newer "legacy free" machines. All communication to the
   RCX is done via the IR tower, which is connected to the machine via a
   serial port. As a result, if you have no serial port connection, you
   will be unable to use the RCX unless you can buy an adapter.
   Furthermore, under certain circumstances, there may be problems with
   IRQs or serial port conflicts. This is particularly likely if your
   modem uses /dev/ttyS0. There are three fixes to this: first, attempt
   to use your second serial port for the IR tower. In most cases, this
   should work. If that doesn't help, just don't use your modem and your
   RCX at the same time. If that is unacceptable, then look in your
   kernel compile options (under "extended dumb serial driver options")
   for "support for sharing serial interrupts." Make sure it is on, and
   recompile.
   
   Because Macs don't have standard serial ports, LinuxPPC users may have
   to get an adapter and make some modifications in order to use these
   tools. Dave Baum, NQC author and Mac user, has written
   [85]instructions on how to do this.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.5. The CyberMaster and Scout

   Besides the RIS, Lego makes two other robotics systems- the
   CyberMaster (available only in Europe) and the Scout. Unfortunately, I
   believe that only one of these tools (NQC, discussed in [86]Section 5)
   will work with these other tools. Generally speaking, if you are
   considering buying a Scout, unless you are severely financially
   restrained, go ahead and buy an RCX- the additional investment is
   worth it.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.6. Mindstorms Vision Command

   The [87]Vision Command kit is a new addition to the Mindstorms line
   that uses a USB camera to do some cool stuff. Unfortunately, because
   USB camera support (in particular, USB Quickcam support) is still
   shaky under Linux, the product is not yet supported under Linux. If
   you want to look into hacking it yourself, you may want to look at
   [88]this page which has a driver for a similar Quickcam.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.7. Important Note about the MS Windows CD

   Because many of the programs discussed below use the official Lego
   firmware, you may need your MS Windows CD. You won't need to ever boot
   MS Windows- your uptime is safe :) However, (if you run NQC or RCX.pm,
   among others), you may need to mount the CD to get the firmware when
   your batteries die. If you want to minimize this, find the file
   firm0309.lgo on the CD and copy it to a safe place on your Linux
   partition.

3.5. Platforms

   Developed on x86 GNU/Linux and tested on PPC Linux. It has also been
   ported to Cygwin and DJGPP on MS Windows. Solaris and Irix ports have
   been attempted but not all tools work.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.6. Description

   LegOS is a pre-emptive multitasking POSIXish OS for the RIS. Programs
   are written in standard C or C++, compiled on the PC using gcc (built
   as a cross-compiler), and then downloaded to the RCX where they are
   executed. Basically, anything you can write in C or C++ (and 32K of
   RAM, of course ;) you can write in legOS. Interesting features include
   random(), floating point emulation, threading with POSIX semaphores,
   and the ability to store multiple programs. It also includes
   functionality for sending and receiving data from Linux and MS Windows
   PCs. This power (legOS is almost definitely the most powerful of the
   RCX alternative software systems) comes at a slight cost: because it
   uses gcc, legOS is probably the most complex system to set up of the
   various Linux alternatives, and requires the largest download of
   tools.

4.6. Description

   Lego::RCX.pm is basically a perl library for remote control of the RCX
   via the IR tower. It takes over the IR tower and sends commands that
   the standard firmware can interpret and act upon. If you already have
   perl installed (and who doesn't?) this is a very quick and simple way
   to control your robot. No installation is necessary: merely copy the
   files into the correct library directories, and add "use RCX.pm" to
   the top of your perl script. I'm not sure if this has been done yet,
   but it would make a ridiculously easy way to interface a robot with a
   CGI script.

5.4. Language

   A C-like language, called (of course) Not Quite C. Should be pretty
   easy to learn for anyone with even minimal coding experience.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5.5. Platforms

   GNU/Linux, MS Windows, and Macintosh.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5.6. Description

   NQC is a byte-code compiler that takes programs written in a C-like
   syntax and compiles it (on the PC) into byte-code that can be
   understood by the standard Lego firmware. This approach has strengths
   and drawbacks: for example, the standard firmware can handle only 32
   variables and so NQC is similarly limited. However, you can do a
   surprising amount within these limitations. Setup is pretty simple and
   the project as a whole is very well documented. This is also probably
   the most popular alternative programming system, so there are a lot of
   people willing and ready to help out if you start using NQC.
   
   As already mentioned, NQC is the only option (right now) that supports
   the Cybermaster and Scout products under Linux. Furthermore, a beta
   version of it works with version 2.0 of the firmware, making it the
   first alternative programming system to support the added
   functionality of the new firmware.

     _________________________________________________________________
   
6.6. Description

   pbForth is basically a complete Forth interpreter which replaces the
   standard firmware. Once it is there, you download Forth scripts to the
   robot, and the interpreter then interprets and runs the scripts. There
   are no limitations on the number of variables, and there are a number
   of "libraries" that are provided for functionality like interactive
   debugging. This is about the ultimate in simplicity for tool setup:
   all you have to do is download a binary, and then write code and
   download it. No other tools, compilers, interpreters reside on the PC.
   That said, there is a cross-platform TCL GUI available that simplifies
   downloading of scripts and interaction with the PC.

7.6. Description

   As the name implies, TinyVM is indeed a small Java Virtual Machine
   that is downloaded to the RCX to replace the standard firmware. Java
   programs are then written and byte-compiled on the PC and downloaded
   to the RCX. A TinyVM program can use some standard Java libraries, and
   a library for control of sensors, motors, and such on the Mindstorm is
   provided. TinyVM requires an already functional java compiler.
   
   leJOS is a similar project (in fact, it is a code fork) by the same
   author. It is much higher footprint (currently about 5K additional
   size) but also includes substantial additional functionality,
   including support for floating point and String constants. Other
   planned features include garbage collection and multiple program
   loading.

   Both of these libraries are (theoretically) cross-platform Java
   libraries that send signals that can be used to remotely control an
   RCX that is using the original firmware. Neither have been tested with
   Linux, and neither are even in active development, but they may be
   useful sources for someone, which is why I've included them here.

   The TCL RCX compiler has double-edged functionality: it can either
   compile a TCL script into RCX byte-code, or it can remotely control
   the robot via either a script or an interactive TCL shell. If TCL is
   your language of choice, this is the optimal solution. There are two
   versions available: Laurent's (at demailly.com) appears to be the
   original of the two. However, neither appear to have been updated
   since 1998.

10.6. Description

   Pylnp is a unique remote control library, not only because of it's use
   of Python, but also because instead of interfacing with the standard
   firmware, it interfaces with legOS. Because of this, it provides a
   great deal of customizability that the other remote control libraries
   may not have, since it can be used to invoke custom functions on the
   legOS side of the robot. The downside of this power, of course, is
   that you must learn legOS and write C programs to access this superior
   functionality.

   These programs aren't strictly Mindstorms related, but they may be of
   interest to Linux/Lego fans.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.1. LeoCAD

   LeoCAD is (as the name implies) a CAD program for constructing and
   renderging Lego models. There is a usable GTK port, which can be found
   at [101]http://leocad.gerf.org/linux.htm. The author implies that it
   doesn't have full functionality, so this might make a fun project for
   someone.

11.2. POVRAY

   Sets of Lego pieces have been created for use with the popular POVRAY
   3-D rendering program. You can find the pieces at
   [102]http://www.kawo1.rwth-aachen.de/~witte/projekte/lego/lego.html
   and POVRAY at [103]http://www.povray.org.

12. Other sources of information

   Now that you've read this, there are a number of other places on the
   web to further explore the Mindstorms. Most of these are not Linux
   specific, but most of them that have discussion forums probably have
   at least a few users who use Linux. Hopefully, I've stimulated you
   enough to explore some more. Enjoy!

12.1. LUGNET

   The LEGO User Group NETwork site, [104]http://www.lugnet.com/, has
   long been the center of the online Lego universe. It has great
   newsgroups with lots of people. In particular, the [105]robotics forum
   has an avid group of very knowledgeable readers and posters. In
   addition, several of the options above have their own active
   newsgroups in the [106]robotics/rcx/ hierarchy.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12.2. The Official Mindstorms Site

   The official Mindstorms site at [107]http://www.legomindstorms.com/
   has lots of neat ideas, and even accepts NQC source for public
   distribution. However, don't expect gobs of info on Linux.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
12.3. The Hardware Sites

   I've already mentioned these, but it can't hurt. These are the most
   comprehensive and detailed looks at the RCX hardware that are
   available to folks who aren't LEGO engineers. The "original" site is
   [108]http://www.crynwr.com/lego-robotics/ and the second is
   [109]http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kekoa/rcx

12.4. Historic Lego Bots and Construction Guide

   As you may know, the RIS was partially inspired by work done at MIT.
   The creator of the famous "Lego class" at MIT has a [110]home page
   that includes not only links to the class (some seriously cool stuff
   in there!) but also to his Robot Builder's Guide, which has lots of
   great suggestions about actually building robots to execute all the
   great programs you've just learned how to write.
