<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Quota Setup on Linux - Part II: Assigning Quota for Users and Groups</A></H2>

<P>
<P>This operation is performed with the edquota command (man edquota for details).
<P>I would normally run quotacheck with the flags -avug to obtain the most
updated filesystems usage prior to editing quota. This is just a personal habit,
and not a required step however.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Assigning quota for a particular user</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Here's an example. I have a user with the login id bob on my system.  The
command "edquota -u bob" takes me into vi (or editor specified in my $EDITOR
environment variable) to edit quota for user bob on each partition that has
quota enabled:
<HR>
<PRE>
Quotas for user bob: 
/dev/hda2: blocks in use: 2594, limits (soft = 5000, hard = 6500) 
         inodes in use: 356, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1500)
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>"blocks in use" is the total number of blocks (in kilobytes) a user has
comsumed on a partition.
<P>"inodes in use" is the total number of files a user has on a partition.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Assigning quota for a particular group</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Now I have a group games on my system. "edquota -g games" takes me into
the vi editor again to edit quota for the group games:
<HR>
<PRE>
        Quotas for group games: 
        /dev/hda4: blocks in use: 5799, limits (soft = 8000, hard = 10000) 
                inodes in use: 1454, limits (soft = 3000, hard = 4000)
</PRE>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Assigning quota for a bunch of users with the same value</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>To rapidly set quotas for, say 100 users, on my system to the same value
as my user bob, I would first edit bob's quota information by hand, then execute:
<HR>
<PRE>
edquota -p bob `awk -F: '$3 &gt; 499 {print $1}' /etc/passwd`
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>assuming that you are using csh, and that you assign your user UID's starting
with 500.
<P>In addition to edquota, there are 3 terms which you should familiarize
yourself with: Soft Limit, Hard Limit, and Grace Period.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Soft Limit</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>_Soft limit_ indicates the maximum amount of disk usage a quota user has
on a partition. When combined with grace period, it acts as the border line,
which a quota user is issued warnings about his impending quota violation when
passed.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Hard Limit</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Hard limit works only when grace period is set. It specifies the absolute
limit on the disk usage, which a quota user can't go beyond his hard limit.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Grace Period</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Executed with the command "edquota -t", grace period is a time limit  before
the soft limit is enforced for a file system with quota enabled. Time units
of sec(onds), min(utes), hour(s), day(s), week(s), and month(s) can be used.
This is what you'll see with the command "edquota -t":
<HR>
<PRE>
Time units may be: days, hours, minutes, or seconds 
Grace period before enforcing soft limits for users: 
/dev/hda2: block grace period: 0 days, file grace period: 0 days 
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Change the 0 days part to any length of time you feel reasonable. I personally
would choose 7 days (or 1 week).
