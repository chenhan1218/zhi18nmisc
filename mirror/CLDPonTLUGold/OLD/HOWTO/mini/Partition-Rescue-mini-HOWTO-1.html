<P>This mini-HOWTO addresses only the "lost partition table" problem. This can
be when :
<P>
<UL>
<LI>you have no more access to your computer, with the "no operating system"
message,</LI>
<LI>you have installed a new system (ie windows) and you see no more Linux,
and windows take up all the capacity of the disk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Here you will learn that if you know the right thing and do it, Linux comes
usually safe from such things. Windows can, but it's luckier.
<P>We will first see what you can do <EM>before</EM> the problem to ease the future
recovery and what you must do <EM>after</EM> to recover. There is little to do to prevent
from erasing a disk, usually this is done by automatic windows or Linux-install
ill behaved programs or users mistakes - nothing can be done to prevent this
except care, but you are already careful, isn't it ?
<P>It can also be done by the use of MSDOS/Windows fdisk. avoid it as most
as you can, but you probably can't.
<P>I have done this many times, on my computer and on others' guy computers
and restored Linux most of the time and windows sometimes. I wish you luck !
