1. Introduction

   This miniHOWTO is about how to get the OpenGL/GLX Linux QuakeWorld
   client compiled and working on systems with standard OpenGL hardware
   acceleration support.
   
   This procedure was developed while struggling to get glqwcl.glx to
   work on a system with Linux Slackware 7.0 (2.2.16), XFree86 4.0.1, a
   GeForce 256 DDR video card, and NVIDIA's 0.9-4 MesaGL drop-in
   replacement lib/driver (libGL.so.1.0.4).

2. The Procedure

   It seems that the glqwcl.glx binary available at least at
   [9]www.quakeworld.net in the package
   qwcl-2.30-glibc-i386-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz is not compiled properly
   since on startup, it looks for libglide2x.so.
   
   QuakeWorld clients come in several flavors:
   
   OpenGL:
          glqwcl (3dfx only?)
          
          glqwcl.glx (MesaGL/XFree4)
          
   Software only:
          qwcl (svgalib)
          
          qwcl.xl1 (x11/svgalib)
          
   Again, this miniHOWTO is about getting the glqwcl.glx working with
   XFree86 4.x DRI.
   
    1. Download the Quake source code, q1source.zip, from
       [10]ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/q1source.zip. This zip
       file contains all versions of Quake1/QuakeWorld.
       After compiling, you will get version:
       
        LinuxGL (0.98) QuakeWorld 2.40 (as of this writing, Aug 19, 2000)


       You will also need to download the Mesa 3D Library source code
       from [11]http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/. MesaLib-3.3.tar.gz is
       good.
       
        cd /usr/src
        tar -xvzf MesaLib-3.3.tar.gz

        This puts the mesa source at /usr/src/Mesa-3.3


       Build the mesa source code:
       
        cd /usr/src/Mesa-3.3
        ./configure --prefix=/usr
        make


       Depending on your setup, you might not need to actually install
       Mesa. If you are going to install Mesa, be aware that Mesa will
       install over the libGL.* files you already have in /usr/lib. Those
       libGL.* files are likely to be your hardware accelerated versions.
       Installing Mesa will also overwrite the glx include files in
       /usr/X11R6/include/GL. Therefore, before you install Mesa, make a
       backup of /usr/lib/libGL.* and /usr/X11R6/include/GL/glx*.h.
       To install it:
       
        make install


       After you install the full Mesa package, you might need to
       reinstall your hardware accelerated libGL files or restore the
       backup suggested above. You also need to restore the glx include
       files. You can restore the glx include files either by restoring
       the files that you backed up as suggested above, or if you have
       the source to X still lying around, then you can copy the include
       files from the source: cp xc/include/GL/*.h /usr/X11R6/include/GL
       By installing the Mesa libs, you will get the libGLU* files and
       associated include files installed on your system. XFree86 4.0.1
       appeared to be lacking libGLU* and its include files. GLU, the
       OpenGL Utility library is a standard part of a normal OpenGL
       installation that is missing from XFree86 4 and may not come with
       vendor-specific OpenGL drivers either.
       XFree86 4.0.1 appears to have included only the core of Mesa 3.3,
       which at the time was/is a development version of MesaGL. The
       direct rendering infrusture (DRI) of XFree86 is based on Mesa
       code.
       If you happen to have an Nvidia card and are interested in a
       complete HOWTO for installing the Nvidia drivers and an assortment
       of OpenGL libraries (GLU, glut, Qt, OpenGL man pages), then see
       the NVIDIA-OpenGL-Configuration_miniHOWTO at:
       [12]http://www.comptechnews.com/~reaster/nvgl.txt
       You can check the LDP for it also.
    2. Make a directory to hold the quake source:
       
        mkdir q1src
        cd q1src
        unzip ../q1source.zip
        cd QW
        cp Makefile.Linux Makefile


    3. Edit the Makefile:
       
        Line 30:
                MAINDIR=/home/<you>/q1src (where you unzipped the source)
                
        Line 37:
                MESA_DIR=/usr/src/Mesa-3.3 or wherever you put the Mesa
                source code
                
        Lines 43 and 46:
                You might need to remove all the optimization compiler
                flags in order to get a stable binary. (I did) You can
                play around with them. For instance, strange things
                happened when it opened the pak files with optimizations
                on: It would error out saying there are millions of files
                in id1/pak0.pak!
                
                I removed all of the following RELEASE_CFLAGS:
                
                -O6
                -ffast-math
                -funroll-loops
                -fomit-frame-pointer
                -fexpensive-optimizations
                -malign-loops=2
                -malign-jumps=2
                -malign-functions=2


                However, further experimentation seemed to show that at
                least the following two are ok:
                
                -ffast-math
                -fexpensive-optimizations


                The really troublesome flag seems to be the -O6 flag. I
                tried setting it down to -O1 and still had trouble. The
                -malign* flags were unnecessary too.
                
        Line 50:
                Add: -DGL_EXT_SHARED
                
                This #define is found inside at least gl_vidlinuxglx.c
                where it conditionally compiles some 3DFx/glide-specific
                code #ifndef! Without this, the compile will error with
                unresolved external functions related to glide/3dfx.
                
                Remove: -I/usr/include/glide
                
                Change: -L/usr/local/src/Mesa-3.0/lib to where you put
                the Mesa source: -L/usr/src/Mesa-3.3/lib
                
                Remove any other glide references and fix the path to
                Mesa source wherever else it is referenced.
                
        Line 73:
                Delete the targets you don't care to have built. Some of
                them may not build? Leave just the glqwcl.glx build
                target.
                
       Make sure that you have a symlink from /usr/X11 to /usr/X11R6.
       When installing X yourself, you might forget to do that and some
       source code and programs look for X there:
       
        cd /usr
        ln -s X11R6 X11


       Save the Makefile.
    4. Fix the mouse hide problem.
       The quake code, as it is, does not hide the mouse when you use it.
       The pointer would remain visible and jitter around a fixed point
       in the middle of the screen - very annoying. I found the following
       simple fix in a mail archive about glx development at:
       [13]http://lists.openprojects.net/pipermail/glx-dev/1999-October/0
       00994.html
       
        cd q1src/QW/client
        edit the file: gl_vidlinuxglx.c


       At the top of the function called install_grabs(void) (Line 234),
       add the following code:
       
        static void install_grabs(void)
        {
                /* vars to make blank cursor */
                Pixmap blank;
                XColor dummy;
                char data[1] = {0};
                Cursor cursor;
                                
                /* make a blank cursor */
                blank = XCreateBitmapFromData (dpy, win, data, 1, 1);
                if(blank == None) fprintf(stderr, "error: out of memory.\n");
                cursor = XCreatePixmapCursor(dpy, blank, blank, &dummy, &dummy,
 0, 0);
                XFreePixmap (dpy, blank);
                Con_Printf("Cursor blanked.\n");


       The 8th parameter to XGrabPointer should be changed from "None" to
       "cursor" to use the blank cursor:
       
        
        XGrabPointer(dpy, win,
                         True,
                         0,
                         GrabModeAsync, GrabModeAsync,
                         win,
                         cursor,
                         CurrentTime);


       (see: man XGrabPointer)
       This fix might work for the other client builds if you make
       similar changes in the appropriate *vid*.c file. As it is, this
       creates a memory leak as it allocates another Cursor object
       everytime through and doesn't call XFreeCursor() but this is
       probably not a problem since I don't think a 1x1 cursor is using
       much memory. If you want, you can apply the following patch
       against q1src/QW/client/gl_vidlinuxglx.c (patch gl_vidlinuxglx.c
       patchfile). Just cut and paste the contents between the begin/end
       patchfile lines into a file called patchfile (or whatever you want
       to call it). Save patchfile in the q1src/QW/client directory where
       gl_vidlinuxglx.c is. Then run the command:
       
        
        patch gl_vidlinuxglx.c patchfile


       This patch file will make gl_vidlinuxglx.c such that it doesn't
       have any memory leak. You can download this patch file at:
       [14]http://www.comptechnews.com/~reaster/gl_vidlinuxglx.c.patch.

       It is then handy to bind some keys at the quake console to toggle
       mouse grabbing:
       
        
        bind q "_windowed_mouse 0"
        bind w "_windowed_mouse 1"


    5. Compile (finally!)
       Just run "make build_release" with no parameters from where the
       Makefile is located:
       
        cd q1src/QW
        make build_release


       If all goes well, you will have a binary, glqwcl.glx, in the
       releasei386-glibc directory. Copy glqwcl.glx to another directory
       (like "qw") and then from a Quake cd or other quake installation,
       copy the id1 directory and any other game directories you
       like/have - ctf, Fortress etc - to your new quakeworld directory.
    6. Running the game.
       You might want to run it like this from XQF: glqwcl.glx -width
       1280 -height 1024 (or any other resolution your system can
       support)
       XQF is a nice program to find QuakeWorld servers and can be found
       at: [15]http://www.linuxgames.com/xqf
       To run the game fullscreen requires starting the game at the same
       resolution as your X desktop. If you are running a desktop
       environment, you might not be able to hide everything. The sure
       way to get a fullscreen experience is to run XFree86 on its own
       without any desktop environment or window manager loaded:
       
        XFree86 &
                This starts X without any desktop environment or window
                manager. /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc normally starts your
                desktop.
                
        CTRL-ALT-'-' and CTRL-ALT-'+'
                Switches to the resolution you want. Check your
                /etc/X11/XF86Config if you don't have any other
                resolutions available.
                
        CTRL-ALT-F1
                Switches back to the text console.
                
        xterm -display localhost:0.0 &
                All X applications accept a -display command line
                argument to tell it which X server to display on. Every X
                program is an X server client. 0.0 represents the screen
                on F7, 1.0 on F8, etc. localhost is your computer. Its
                possible and very common to execute an X program on one
                computer but have it display on some other workstation.
                localhost could be an IP address or the dns name of any
                computer running X that is accepting connections from
                where you run the X client application program.
                
        ALT-F7
                Switches back to X 0.0. Using xterm, start XQF or
                whatever program you use to launch Quake.
                
        glqwcl.glx -width w -height h
                Tell your quake launcher to start it like this, where w
                and h are the resolution you are at. A good resolution is
                1024 by 768.
                
       Light effects.
       At the console, you can try turning on and off the flashblend
       function and see which lighting effects you prefer:
       
                        
                gl_flashblend 0
                gl_flashblend 1
        
       When it is on (1), you may notice colored light effects around
       flags and special items. In this mode, you may NOT see flashes
       from weapons and light on the walls from rockets. The exact
       effects of toggling flashblend may depend on your specific OpenGL
       installation.
       When it is off (0), there may not be any COLORED light, but
       otherwise all light effects work. Flags and special items have a
       glow around them and light up surrounding surfaces. Weapons flash
       when fired and rockets light up everything around them as they
       travel.
    7. HAVE FUN!
