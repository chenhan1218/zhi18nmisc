1. Introduction

   Every Linux user has been sooner or later trapped in a situation in
   which having working Backspace and Delete keys on the console and on X
   seemed impossible. This paper explains why this happens and suggests
   solutions. The notions given here are essentially
   distribution-independent: due to the widely different content of
   system configuration files in each distribution, I will try to give
   the reader enough knowledge to think up his/her own fixes, if
   necessary.
   
   I assume that the Backspace key should go back one character and then
   erase the character under the cursor. On the other hand, the Delete
   key should delete the character under the cursor, without moving it.
   If you think that the function of the two keys should be exchanged, in
   spite of the fact that most keyboards feature an arrow pointing to the
   left (<-) on the Backspace key, then this paper will not give you
   immediate solutions, but certainly you may find the explanations given
   here useful.
   
   Another assumption is that the fixes should alter only local (user)
   files. No standard part of the distribution should be altered.
   Finally, this document discusses how to set up your system so that
   applications get the right events. If an application decides to
   interpret such events in an idiosyncratic way, the only possible fix
   is to reconfigure the application.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2. How Keys Are Turned Into Actions

   When a key is pressed on the keyboard, a number of hardware and
   software components cooperate so as to guarantee that the intended
   meaning of the key (e.g., emitting a certain character) matches the
   actual behaviour of the key. I will concentrate on the software side
   (as our control on the hardware part is nonexistent), and in
   particular, for the time being, on the events related to console
   output.
   
    1. Hitting a key causes raw keyboard scancodes to be generated; these
       scancodes are then transformed in a keycode. On an i386 system,
       usually the key Backspace emits 14 and the key Delete emits 111.
    2. The keycodes are translated by the keyboard library into a
       keyboard symbol (keysym) using the keyboard definition loaded by
       the user. If you look into your keyboard database (e.g., under Red
       Hat Linux, in /usr/lib/kbd/), you'll discover several definitions
       for different computers, different layouts and possibly different
       interpretations of the same keys (e.g., one could desire that the
       two Alt keys really behave as distinct modifiers). The Linux
       console keyboard layout assigns keysym Delete to keycode 14 and
       keysym Remove to keycode 111. This may seem strange, but the Linux
       console emulates a VT102 terminal, and this is the way things work
       in that realm.
    3. Our journey has still to come to an end. Console applications read
       ASCII sequences, not keysyms. So the console must read keysyms and
       translate them into ASCII sequences that suitably encode the keys.
       Of course this operation must be performed in a way that is
       understandable by applications. For instance, on the Linux console
       the Delete keysym is mapped to the ASCII code 127 (DEL), the
       Remove keysym on a suitable escape sequence, and the BackSpace
       keysym to ASCII code 8 (BS).
    4. Finally, we must in a sense roll back to what we had before and
       translate the ASCII sequences generated by each key into a key
       capability. This goal is reached by a terminal database, which
       contains, for each kind of terminal, a reverse mapping from
       sequences of characters to key capabilities (which are essentially
       a subset of the keysyms).
       
     Note: Unfortunately, there are two "standard" terminal databases,
     termcap and terminfo. Depending on your distribution, you could be
     using either one of them, or the database could even depend on the
     application. Our discussion will concentrate on the more modern
     terminfo database, but the suggested fixes take both into
     consideration.
     
       For instance, on the Linux console F1 generates an escape followed
       by [[A, which can be translated to the capability key_f1 by
       looking into the terminal-database entry of the console (try
       infocmp linux if you want to have a look at the entry). A very
       good and thorough discussion of terminal databases can be found in
       GNU's termcap manual. Usually Linux applications use the newer
       terminfo database, contained in the ncurses package.
       Maybe at this point not surprisingly, the Linux console terminfo
       entry maps DEL to the kbs (backspace key) capability, and escape
       followed by [3~ to the kdch1 ("delete-one-char" key) capability.
       Even if you could find strange that the Backspace key emits a DEL,
       the terminal database puts everything back into its right place,
       and correctly behaving applications will interpret DEL as the
       capability kbs, thus deleting the character to the left of the
       cursor.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3. Why It Doesn't (Always) Work

   I hope the basic problem is clear at this point: there is a bottleneck
   between the keyboard and the applications, that is, the fact that they
   can only communicate by ASCII sequences. So special keys must be first
   translated from keysyms to sequences, and then from sequences to key
   capabilities. Since different consoles have different ideas about what
   this translation can look like, we need a terminal database. The
   system would work flawlessly, except for a small problem: not everyone
   uses it.
   
   More precisely, many application do not use the terminal database (or
   at least not all of it), and consider BS and DEL ASCII codes with an
   intended meaning: thus, without looking at the database, they assign
   them semantics (usually, of course, the semantics is removing the
   character before or under the cursor). So now our beautiful scheme is
   completely broken (as every Linux user is bitterly aware). For
   instance, the bash assumes that DEL should do a backward-delete-char,
   that is, backspace. Hence, on a fresh install the Backspace key works
   on the console as expected, but just because of two twists in a row!
   Of course, the Delete key does not work. This happens because the bash
   does not look into the terminal database for the kdch1 capability.
   
   Just to illustrate how things have become entangled, consider the
   fix_bs_and_del script provided with the Red Hat distribution (and
   maybe others). It assigns on-the-fly the BackSpace keysym to the
   Backspace key, and the Delete keysym to the Delete key. Now the shell
   works! Unfortunately, all programs relying on the correct coupling of
   keysym generation and terminal database mappings are now not working
   at all, as the Delete keysym is mapped to DEL, and the latter to the
   kbs key capability by the terminfo database, so in such programs both
   keys produce backspacing.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4. X

   The situation under X is not really different. There is just a
   different layer, that is, the X window system translates the scancodes
   into its own keysyms, which are much more varied and precise than the
   console ones, and feeds them into applications (by the way, this is
   the reason why XEmacs is not plagued by the problem: X translates
   keycode 14 to keysym BackSpace and keycode 111 to keysym Delete, and
   then the user can easily assign to those keysyms the desired
   behaviour). Of course, a terminal emulator program (usually a VT100
   emulator in the X world) must translate the X keysyms into ASCII
   sequences, so we are again in our sore business.
   
   More in detail, xterm behaves exactly like the console (i.e., it emits
   the same ASCII sequences), but, for instance, gnome-terminal emits BS
   for Backspace and DEL for Delete. The real fun starts when you realise
   that by default they use the same terminal-database entry, so the fact
   that the kbs capability is associated to an ASCII DEL makes all
   correctly behaving applications produce the same behaviour for the
   Backspace and Delete keys in gnome-terminal. The simple statement
bash$ export TERM=gnome

   can solve the problem in this case for correctly behaving
   applications. Well, not always, because your system could lack an
   entry in the terminal database named gnome, in particular if it is not
   particularly up-to-date.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5. What You Should Do When Writing Applications

   When you write a console application, be kind to the user and try to
   understand what comes from the standard input using the following
   fallback chain:
   
    1. open the right terminfo entry, and try to process the sequence so
       as to discover whether it has a particular meaning on the current
       terminal; if so, use the terminfo semantics;
    2. use the ASCII intended meaning on line feeds, newlines, tab
       characters and, of course, BS and DEL. Crossing your finger could
       also be useful.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6. What You Should Do On Your System

   Note again that the main issue that confuses people trying to fix
   their system is that usually they are fixing thing in the wrong place.
   Since the parts that work often just work by chance, trying to fix the
   system assuming something is broken will usually lead to change
   correct settings into incorrect settings.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6.1. What Needs to Be Done

6.1.1. Distinguishing Between Emulators

   The first step towards a clean solution is to get rid of the confusion
   between gnome-terminal and xterm, and, more generally, between
   different terminal emulators. Theoretically, the option termname
   should allow the user to set the TERM variable to a more sensible
   name, for instance gnome. However, as of gnome-terminal 1.2.1 the
   option does not work.
   
   The idea here is to exploit the fact that gnome-terminal sets the
   COLORTERM variable to gnome-terminal. Thus, by adding a simple test to
   the shell configuration files we can fix the TERM variable.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6.1.2. Fixing the Terminal Database

   Our problem now is that the terminal database could lack an entry
   named gnome (this happens on a number of termcap and terminfo
   versions). Recent terminfo databases have an entry, but since
   gnome-terminal essentially emulates xterm modulo a couple of keys, it
   is possible to automagically generate a brand new correct entry. This
   will fix the behaviour of all correct applications using the terminal
   database.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6.1.3. Fixing the Shell Behaviour

   The readline library used by the bash and by many other programs to
   read the input line can be customized so to recognize specific
   sequences of characters. The customization can also depend on the TERM
   variable, so once we can distinguish terminals we can do fine tuning
   of the keyboard.
   
   Moreover, if you want less and other application that do raw line
   input to work correctly, you must convince the shell that under
   gnome-terminal the erase character is BS, and not DEL (in the other
   case the Backspace key is already emitting DEL, so we do not have to
   do anything). This can be done using the command stty.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6.2. How to Do It

   Caution
   
   These fixes have some drawbacks. First, they work only for the
   specified terminals. Second, in theory (but this is unlikely to
   happen) they could confuse the readline library on other terminals.
   Both limitations are however mostly harmless.
   
   First of all, check with infocmp gnome whether you already have a
   gnome entry in your terminfo (we will fix termcap later). If the entry
   does not exist, the following command
bash$ tic <(infocmp xterm |\
        sed 's/xterm|/gnome|/' |\
        sed 's/kbs=\\177,/kbs=^H,/' |\
        sed 's/kdch1=\\E\[3~,/kdch1=\\177,/')

   will create a correct one in ~/.terminfo. If the same command is
   launched by the root, it will generate the entry in the global
   database (you can override this behaviour by setting TERMINFO to
   ~/.terminfo).
   
   Now, add add the following snippet to ~/.inputrc[12][1]:
"\e[3~": delete-char

$if term=gnome
DEL: delete-char
$endif

   The first line makes the Delete key work on the console and on xterm,
   and with a bit of luck it should not interfere with other terminals.
   The other conditional assignment makes gnome-terminal work given that
   the TERM variable is set correctly. To guarantee this, add
if [ "$COLORTERM" = "gnome-terminal" ]
then
    export TERM=gnome
fi

if [ "$TERM" = "gnome" ]
then
    export TERMCAP=$(infocmp -C gnome | grep -v '^#' | \
                    tr '\n\t' '  ' | sed 's/\\  //g' | sed s/::/:/g)
    stty erase ^H
fi

   to your ~/.bashrc configuration file[13][2]. The assignments are
   executed only under gnome-terminal: the first export sets correctly
   the TERM variable, the second one creates a local termcap entry
   deriving it from the terminfo one[14][3], and finally we use stty to
   instruct the shell that the erase character is really BS.
   
     Note: If you have a Red Hat older than 6.0, then you must add also
     
$if term=xterm
DEL: delete-char
$endif

     to your ~/.inputrc file and
     
if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ]
then
    stty erase ^H
fi

     to your ~/.bashrc file. The keyboard policy of Red Hat changed with
     6.0 in a backward-incompatible way, so there is nothing you can do
     about this.
     
     Note: Later versions or different distribution could have fixes
     already in place in the system-wide /etc/inputrc configuration
     file, as it happens, for instance, in Red Hat 7.0. In this case you
     can eliminate redundant lines from your ~/.inputrc. Moreover, later
     versions of gnome-terminal could implement the termname option
     correctly. In this case, a cleaner way of getting the TERM variable
     set correctly is to invoke gnome-terminal with gnome-terminal
     --termname=gnome (and you can eliminate the check on the COLORTERM
     variable).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6.3. Fixing for tcsh

   In the case of the tcsh, the fixes go all in ~/.tcshrc:
bindkey "^[[3~" delete-char

if ($?COLORTERM) then
   if ($COLORTERM == "gnome-terminal") then
      setenv TERM gnome
   endif
endif

if ($?TERM) then
   if ($TERM == "gnome") then
      setenv TERMCAP \
       "`infocmp -C gnome | grep -v '^#' | tr '\n\t' '  ' | sed 's/\\  //g' | s
ed s/::/:/g`"
      bindkey "\177" delete-char
      stty erase ^H
   endif
endif

     Note: Of course, if you have a Red Hat older than 6.0, then you
     must add also
     
if ($?TERM) then
   if ($TERM == "xterm") then
      bindkey "\177" delete-char
      stty erase ^H
   endif
endif

     to your ~/.tcshrc file.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7. What If Nothing Works

   The first thing to do is understanding which ASCII codes are produced
   by a certain key. The following C one-liner
void main(void) {int c; while(c = getchar()) printf("%d %02X\n", c, c);}

   may help you. Put the line into a file named ascii.c, compile it with
   gcc ascii.c -o ascii, type ./ascii and press a key followed by RETURN.
   The program will display the decimal and hexadecimal codes of the
   ASCII sequence produced (you may want to do a stty erase ^- first to
   get really all the codes).
   
   Once you know which sequences are produced, you must check the current
   terminfo entry with infocmp (don't be scared by the amount of
   information printed!) and be sure that the kbs and kdch1 capabilities
   correspond to the right sequences (that is, the one produced by the
   respective keys).
   
   If there is a mismatch, there can be several different reason: wrong
   content of the TERM variable, wrong entry of the terminal database,
   wrong terminal emulation under X. I hope at this point you have enough
   information to dig the solution autonomously.
   
     Note: If different applications behave in different ways, it is
     likely that some of them are using the terminal database correctly,
     and some are not. Remember that the fact that the keys produce the
     right behaviour in a certain application does not mean that the
     application is using correctly the terminal database--they could
     work just by chance. If you want to have an independent check, you
     can try whether the [15]ne editor works. ne uses all terminal
     capabilities, including kbs and kdch1, and uses intended meaning
     only as a last resource.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
8. Conclusions

   The fixes suggested here should solve to a large extent the problem of
   deleting text you wrote (however, they do not help in creating other
   text :)).
   
   There is a small bug in the whole setting: if you start xterm from
   gnome-terminal, it will get TERM set to gnome. This inconvenience is,
   of course, harmless, and it will be solved as soon as it will be
   possible to start gnome-terminal with TERM suitably set.
   
   Finally, it should be noted that the fixes will not work for broken
   applications (for instance, applications ignoring the kbs key
   capability). There is little to do in this case, as fixing for one
   broken application will likely break all well-behaving ones.
   
  Notes
  
   [16][1]
   
   On older version of the bash, you must remember to set INPUTRC
   suitably, for instance adding
export INPUTRC=~/.inputrc

   to your ~/.profile (or whichever file is read just by login shells).
   [17][2]
   
   More precisely, to the shell configuration file that is read in every
   shell, not only in login shells. The right file depend on startup
   sequence of your bash.
   [18][3]
   
   However, as terminfo entries gets bigger and bigger, this method could
   generate too large a termcap entry.
