<H2><A NAME="s4">4. TrueType Fonts (One of the few things Windows is good for)</A></H2>

<P>Because the boys at Redmond are very concerned with the appearance of
their software (as opposed to the internal workings ;) they built
TrueType font support into Windows.  Windows 95 and nearly every other
variety of Windows comes with Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New,
which are roughly equivalant to Helvetica, Times and Courier.  TrueType
fonts are scalable, so they look good in large sizes, and they are well
hinted, so they are readable at small sizes.  Many windows applications
come with dozens of TrueType fonts.  Don't microwave your Windows CD
yet, you'll want to get the fonts first.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 xfstt</A>
</H2>

<P>Unfortunately, XFree86 does not come with built in TrueType support, so
you'll have to add it yourself.  The easiest way of doing this is with
xfstt, a free TrueType font server.
<H3>Installation</H3>

<P>xfstt is very easy to install.  First, you'll want to download the
tarball from the web.  The most current version is at
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/Xfstt-0.9.10.tgz">http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/Xfstt-0.9.10.tgz</A><P>Once you have the tarball, untar it.
<P>
<PRE>
tar -zxvf Xfstt-0.9.10.tgz
</PRE>
<P>Then build it and install it.  Read the INSTALL file for quick
instructions, but it's a no brainer.  <CODE>make; make install</CODE> is
all you have to do.  Once that's done, copy the TrueType fonts you've
managed to get from various sources to <CODE>/usr/ttfonts</CODE>, and
you're ready to go.  Start xfstt by typing
<P>
<PRE>
xfstt --sync        # updates xfstt's font database
xfstt &amp;             # runs xfstt in the background.
</PRE>
<P>Then type
<P>
<PRE>
xset +fp unix/:7100 # tells X about xfstt.
</PRE>
<P>or add
<P>
<PRE>
FontPath "unix/:7100"
</PRE>
<P>to your <CODE>XF86Config</CODE> to tell X about the font service.
<H3>Adjusting the default font size</H3>

<P>If your TrueType fonts appear to be very tiny, the following commands
help.
<P>Add the <CODE>-dpi</CODE> switch to your X server command line (see section
3 to do this.)
<P> Use the <CODE>--res</CODE> switch to tell xfstt to increase the default
resolution.  Use the following command line.
<P>
<PRE>
xfstt --res 120
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 xfs</A>
</H2>

<P>xfs is an alternative font server that is now being included with
RedHat based distributions. xfs is based on the FreeType Font library
and provides similar functionality to xfstt. xfs is able to serve both
TrueType and Type 1 fonts, as well as legacy X fonts.
<H3>Installation</H3>

<P>First step is to add TrueType Fonts to your linux filesystem. Su to
root, and make a directory to hold the fonts:
<P>
<PRE>
mkdir /usr/share/fonts/ttfonts
</PRE>
<P>Then, add fonts to this directory, either by copying them from your
Windows system:
<P>
<PRE>
cp /mnt/win/path_to_fonts/*ttf  /usr/share/fonts/ttfonts/
</PRE>
<P>or by downloading those available directly from 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm">Microsoft</A>.
<P>These fonts are in self-extracting zip archives. You can still install
them though in linux
<P>
<PRE>
unzip &lt;TTFONT.EXE&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Note that the font file names must be lower case. One quick and easy
way to convert them is to copy them to a DOS (FAT16) filesystem and
then copy them back. DOS doesn't do upper case. For a more linuxian
way, go to the directory containing the fonts and type this:
<P>
<PRE>
ls *TTF | while read f
do
 [ -f "$f" ] &amp;&amp; mv -f "$f" "`echo \"$f\" | tr A-Z a-z`"
done
</PRE>
<P>You'll get the ">" prompt as you type each line, hit return at the end
of each line above.  Note the punctuation -- those "backquotes" are
important!  Once the TrueType fonts are properly installed, as root:
<P>
<PRE>
ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale
mkfontdir
</PRE>
<P>Rerun these commands anytime the contents of your font directory
changes.  Next, edit the xfs font config file, /etc/X11/fs/config, to
add your TrueType fonts to the server's font list:
<P>
<PRE>
catalogue = /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled,
            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,
            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc,
            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1,
            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,
            /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1,
            /usr/share/fonts/ttfonts,
            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi,
            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi
</PRE>
<P>Alternately, you can use the 'chkfontpath --add &lt;font&gt;' command
to add fonts. While you're at it, you may want to change the default
point size too.
<P>
<PRE>
default-point-size = 140
</PRE>
<P>This gives me 14 point, instead of the default 12. Some X apps use
this, some won't.  Next, make sure the FontPath line in
/etc/X11/XF86Config is:
<P>
<PRE>
FontPath "unix/:-1"
</PRE>
<P>Note that "unix/:7100" may also do the trick, but did not work with the
initial release. Comment out any existing FontPath with '#' since you
no longer need it.  The xfs package itself should be installed already
with the other XFree packages. To make sure it runs as one of the
default services either use 'ntsysv' or
<P>
<PRE>
chkconfig --add xfs
</PRE>
<P>Now xfs will start every time you boot.  Now restart X to force the new
FontPath and start/restart xfs
<P>
<PRE>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/xfs restart
</PRE>
<P>You should now have a functioning font server. You can check which
fonts are being served:
<P>
<PRE>
xlsfonts | less
</PRE>
<P>or check them out further with xfontsel, and even better, gfontsel!
