<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Setup on the server</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Compiling the kernels</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>RARP</EM> support in the kernel of the server will probably be a good
idea. You must have it if you will boot without kernel parameters. On
the other hand it doesn't help you, if the client isn't on the same
subnet than the server.
<P>The kernel for the workstation needs the following as a minimum set
compiled in:
<UL>
<LI> <EM>NFS</EM>-filesystem compiled in. (It doesn't need to have
<EM>ext2</EM>-support compiled in, a module suffices.)</LI>
<LI> ``Root on NFS'' must be enabled.</LI>
<LI> The Ethernet driver for the network card of the workstation
must be compiled in.</LI>
<LI> Depending upon your needs you may have to include <EM>RARP</EM> or
<EM>BOOTBP</EM> support for NFS-Root. (By this I mean the questions that
are asked after the NFS question in make config.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>If the workstation will be booted without kernel parameters, you need
also to set the root device to 0:255. Do this by creating a dummy
device file with <CODE>mknod /dev/nfsroot b 0 255</CODE>. After having
created such a device file, you can set root device of the kernel
image with <CODE>rdev &lt;<EM>kernel-image</EM>&gt; /dev/nfsroot</CODE>.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Creation of the root filesystem</A>
</H2>

<H3>Copying the filesystem</H3>

<P><EM> Warning: while these instruction might work for you, they are by
no means sensefull in a production enviroment. For a better way to
setup a root filesystem for the clients, see the NFS-Root-Client mini
howto by Ofer Maor <CODE>&lt;ofer@hadar.co.il&gt;</CODE>.</EM> 
<P>After having decided where to place the root tree, create it with
(e.g.) <CODE>mkdir -p &lt;<EM>directory</EM>&gt;</CODE> and 
<CODE>tar cClf / - | tar xpCf &lt;<EM>directory</EM>&gt; -</CODE>.
<P>If you boot your kernel without LILO, then the rootdir has to be
<CODE>/tftpboot/&lt;<EM>IP-address</EM>&gt;</CODE>. If you don't like it, you
can change it in the top Makefile in the kernel sources, look for a line like:
<CODE>NFS_ROOT = -DNFS_ROOT="\"/tftpboot/%s\""</CODE>
If you change this, you have to recompile the kernel.
<P>
<H3>Changes to the root filesystem</H3>

<P>Now trim the unneeded files, and check the /etc/rc.d scripts. Some
important points:
<UL>
<LI> One important thing is eth0 setup. The workstation comes up
with a, at least partially, setup eth0. Setting up the
IP-address of the workstation to the the IP-Address of the server
is not considered a clever thing to do. (As it happened to the author
on one of his early attempts.)
</LI>
<LI>Another point is the /etc/fstab of the workstation. It should
be setup for nfs filesystems.
</LI>
<LI> <B>WARNING</B>: Don't confuse the server root filesystem and the
workstation root filesystem. (I've already patched up a
rc.inet1 on the server, and wondered why the workstation still
didn't work.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Exporting the filesystem</H3>

<P>Export the root dir to the work station. See <CODE>exports(5)</CODE>. You
most likely will have to restart the nfsd/mountd after this change.
Under RedHat this can easily be done by typing
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs stop ; /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start </CODE>.
<P>
<H3>RARP setup</H3>

<P>Setup the <EM>RARP</EM> somewhere on the net. If you boot without a
nfsroot parameter, the <EM>RARP</EM> server has to be the <EM>NFS</EM>
server. Usually this will be the <EM>NFS</EM> server. To do this, you
will need to run a kernel with <EM>RARP</EM> support.
<P>To do this, execute (and install it somewhere in <CODE>/etc/rc.d</CODE> of
the server!):
<P><CODE>/sbin/rarp -s &lt;<EM>ip-addr</EM>&gt; &lt;<EM>hardware-addr</EM>&gt;</CODE>
<P> where
<DL>
<DT><B>ip-addr</B><DD><P>is the IP address of the workstation, and
<DT><B>hardware-addr</B><DD><P>is the Ethernet address of the network card of
the workstation.
</DL>
<P>example: <CODE>/sbin/rarp -s 131.131.90.200 00:00:c0:47:10:12</CODE>
<P>You can also use a symbolic name instead of the IP-address, as
long the server is able to find out the IP-address. (/etc/hosts
or <EM>DNS</EM> lookups)
<P>
<H3>BOOTP setup</H3>

<P>For <EM>BOOTP</EM> setup you need to edit <CODE>/etc/bootptab</CODE>. Please
consult the <EM>bootpd(8)</EM> and <EM>bootptab(5)</EM> man pages.
<P>
<H3>Finding out hardware addresses</H3>

<P>I don't know the hardware address! How can I find it out?
<UL>
<LI> Boot the kernel disk you made, and watch for the line where
the network card is recognized. It usually contains 6 hex
bytes, that should be the address of the card.</LI>
<LI> Boot the workstation with some OS with TCP/IP networking
enabled. Then ping the workstation from the server. Look in
the ARP-cache by executing:
<CODE>/sbin/arp -a</CODE></LI>
</UL>
