<P>Speakerectomy is by far the most brilliant solution to the audible bell
problem. As its name implies, it consists in removing the beeps by removing
the beeper. The operation is straightforward and you don't
even need any anesthetic, but if you want there's room for refinement.
<P>PC's are usually equipped with a silly switch to lower CPU clock.  The
switch is never used when you work in a multitasking environment, as
you don't even need to slow the computer down to run games based on
software loops. Unfortunately we can't use the switch to increase
processor speed, but we can use it to enable/disable the
loudspeaker. Sometimes the speaker is useful even if you enjoy a
silent number cruncher, for example to signal the end of a lenghty
compilation.  To modify the switch functionality, just detatch it from
the main board and connect its wires in series with the
loudspeaker.
<P>Owners of laptop boxes, unfortunately, don't have easy access to the
loudspeaker, and neither they have a spare switch to turn to a
different task.  The preferred solution for such users is configuring
their software to avoid beeping, as described below.
