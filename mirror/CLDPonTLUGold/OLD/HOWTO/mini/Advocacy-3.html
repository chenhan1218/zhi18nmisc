<P>
<P>The Linux community has known for some time that for many
applications, Linux is a stable, reliable, robust (although not
perfect) product.  Unfortunately, there are still many people,
including key decision-makers, that are not aware of the existence of
Linux and its capabilities.
<P>If Linux and the many other components that make up a Linux
distribution are to reach their full potential, it is critical that we
reach out to prospective ``customers'' and advocate (being careful not
to promise too much) the use of Linux for appropriate applications.
The reason that many a company's products have done well in the
marketplace is not so much due to the product's technical superiority
but the company's marketing abilities.
<P>If you enjoy using Linux and would like to contribute something to
the Linux community, please consider acting on one or more of the
ideas in this mini-HOWTO and help others learn more about Linux.
