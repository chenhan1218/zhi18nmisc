<H2><A NAME="Changingsomegeneralsystemsettings"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Changing some general system settings</A></H2>

<P>
<P>After I got Linux up and running on my laptop, I found
it accessing the harddisk every few seconds, even when there was
no user logged in to the system. The harddisk could never
enter its power saving mode. Reducing harddisk activity
can greatly increase the battery runtime, so this is why I
collected the following recipes.
<P>
<P>I tested all this with RedHat 4.1, the locations of some
configuration settings may be different for your
distribution. (If so, please let me know.)
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 The crond daemon and atrun</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Check your <CODE>/etc/crontab</CODE> file if it starts a process
every minute. You will often find <CODE>atrun</CODE> there.
<P>
<P>With the <CODE>at</CODE> command, you can spool commands that must be
invoked some time in the future. Some Linux systems use a
dedicated <CODE>atd</CODE> daemon to take care of this, others
(e. g. RedHat) let the <CODE>crond</CODE> daemon run <CODE>atrun</CODE> once every
minute.
<P>
<P>This is not really necessairy on most systems, since <CODE>at</CODE>
commands rarely depend upon being invoked on exact time. So
if you find a line like this in your <CODE>/etc/crontab</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# Run any at jobs every minute
* * * * * root [ -x /usr/sbin/atrun ] &amp;&amp; /usr/sbin/atrun
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Then you can safely change this to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# Run any at jobs every hour
00 * * * * root [ -x /usr/sbin/atrun ] &amp;&amp; /usr/sbin/atrun
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Read <CODE>man 5 crontab</CODE> for details. Some folks can even
work fine without the <CODE>crond</CODE> daemon, so if you know
what you are doing, you might want
to consider disabling it completely.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 The update / bdflush daemon</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Linux deals with a lot of open file buffers at any given
moment, so the system must make sure that file changes are saved
to the harddisk as soon possible. Otherwise, those changes
will be lost after a system crash.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>update</CODE> / <CODE>bdflush</CODE> daemon takes care of this. (These
are two names for the same program, so you can use either
name to start the daemon). The default settings will make
this daemon call <CODE>flush</CODE> every 5 seconds and <CODE>sync</CODE> every
30 seconds.
<P>
<P>With my Fujitsu disk this caused non-stop access. (It
seems that this harddisk flushes its ram cache even when
nothing has changed. But this depends on your harddisk's
firmware: Other people told me that their harddisk does enter
its power saving mode even without the following modification.)
<P>
<P>Since Linux does not crash very often anymore, I have changed both
values to 3600 seconds (= one hour). This caused no problems at all
and the constant disk access has stopped. (But if my system crashes
now, there will be more broken files, of course.)
<P>
<P>RedHat 4.1: In <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>, change the update call to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ud::once:/sbin/update -s 3600 -f 3600
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Suse 4.4.1: <CODE>update</CODE> is called in <CODE>/sbin/init.d/boot</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Slackware: <CODE>update</CODE> is called in <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.S</CODE>.
<P>
<P>See <CODE>man update</CODE> for details.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 The syslogd daemon</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The <CODE>syslogd</CODE> daemon is responsible for the various Linux
system log files that are found in the
<CODE>/var/log/</CODE> directory. By default <CODE>syslogd</CODE> will
sync the log file each time after logging a system message.
<P>
<P>You can turn that off by preceding the filename with a dash
in <CODE>/etc/syslog.conf</CODE>. Here's an example as found in
my system's <CODE>syslog.conf</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none                  -/var/log/messages
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This again means that if the system crashes, the message that
reported the problem may not have been stored to disk. Dilemma...
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 The init command</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>During the bootup, the initial processes and daemons will be
started using the <CODE>init</CODE> command. This command (yet again)
calls <CODE>sync</CODE> before each process it creates.
<P>
<P>You can change this by removing the <CODE>sync()</CODE> call in the
source code and recompiling the command.
<P>
<P>To avoid problems with lost file buffers, you should add a
call to <CODE>sync</CODE> in your system's
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt</CODE> script, right before the script
unmounts the file systems.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 The swap partition</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The Linux swap partition is used to increase the physical ram space
with virtual memory. This again is a possible reason for harddisk
access. If your laptop already has a lot of ram or if
the applications that you use are quite simple
(think of <CODE>vi</CODE>), you might want to consider turning it off.
<P>
<P>This of course depends on what you plan to do. 4 to 8 megs are not
enough, you must use a swap partition then. With 8 to 16 megs,
text console applications will work fine and if you can avoid
using a lot of multitasking features, you can safely disable
swap. The X-Windows enviroment requires a lot of ram and you
should not use it without a swap partition unless you really
have a lot more than 16 megs.
<P>
<P>(Sidenote: My laptop with 16 megs and disabled swap partition can run
an <CODE>emacs</CODE> session, four <CODE>bash</CODE> shells and compile a
kernel without running out of memory. That's enough for me.)
<P>
<P>If you already have installed a swap partition, you can disable
it by preceding the <CODE>swapon</CODE>
command that is called in <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</CODE> with
a hash mark. If you don't want to make it a permanent move, let
the system ask during boot if you want to use the swap
partition. In <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</CODE> (RedHat 4.1) or
<CODE>/sbin/init.d/boot</CODE> (Suse 4.4.1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
echo "Should the system use swap?"
echo "  0: No."
echo "  1: Yes."
/bin/echo "Your choice: \c"
read SWAPCHOICE

case "$SWAPCHOICE" in
    0)
        # Do nothing.
        echo "(Swap partitions disabled)"
        ;;
    *)
        # Start up swapping.
        echo "Activating swap partitions"
        swapon -a
esac
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Then you can use the swap partition while on ac power and drop
it while on battery.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 The apache httpd webserver daemon</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>I am using my laptop to develop and test cgi scipts for
websites, that is why I am running a local webserver on
it. The standard configuration is a bit too much if all you
want to do is just test a script or check a page from time
to time.
<P>
<P>In <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE>, just change the values of
<CODE>MinSpareServers</CODE> and <CODE>StartServers</CODE> to <CODE>1</CODE>. This
will be enough for a local test site.
<P>
<P>If you wish to turn off the webserver's logging, you must
recompile the <CODE>httpd</CODE> daemon. Read the documentation for
details.
<P>
<P>Grant Taylor recompiled apache's logging and found
that this ``didn't make it stop churning the disk. So I used
another, IMHO better, solution: I configured apache to run
from inetd instead of standalone.'' Read <CODE>man inetd</CODE> for
details.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="TheXFree86package"></A> <A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 The XFree86 package</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Configuring XFree86 for laptops is a story of its own. And
yet again, I have
to refer you to the Linux Laptop page where you
will find a lot of help on this.
<P>
<P>X's console blanking only turns the screen black, but does
not turn it off. As mentioned in the
<A HREF="Battery-Powered-3.html#sidenoteaboutconsoleblanking">sidenote about console blanking</A>,
you can use <CODE>xset</CODE>'s dpms option to change this.
However, this feature depends on your laptop's
graphics chipset and bios.
<P>
<P>Grant Taylor uses the following setup to send his laptop to
sleep with the help of <CODE>apmd</CODE> and the screensaver:
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# Run xscreensaver with APM program
xscreensaver -timeout 5 \
             -xrm xscreensaver.programs:apm_standby \ 
             -xrm xscreensaver.colorPrograms:apm_standby &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Where ``<CODE>apm_standby</CODE> is a suid perl script that allows only
certain people to run <CODE>apm -S</CODE>.''
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 The emacs editor</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Ok, <CODE>emacs</CODE> is not an editor, but a way of life. Here's
a tip from Florent Chabaud: ``If you use <CODE>emacs</CODE>, perhaps
you have noticed that the editor makes some automatic saves.
This is of course useful and should <EM>not</EM> be disabled, but
the default parameters can be adjusted to a laptop use.
<P>
<P>I have put in the file
<CODE>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el</CODE>
the two following lines:
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
(setq auto-save-interval 2500)
(setq auto-save-timeout nil)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This disables auto-saving based on time, and makes the
auto-saving be done every 2500 keyboard actions. Of course
if you are typing a text this last parameter should be reduced,
but for programming it is sufficient. Since every action
(up, down, left, backspace, paste, etc...) is counted, 2500
actions are reached very rapidly.''
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.9">4.9 How to find more ways to optimize</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If your Linux system still seems to access the harddisk too
often, you can find out what is going on inside by using
the <CODE>ps ax</CODE> command. This will show all running processes
and their full name, sometimes it also reveals the command
line arguments of each process.
<P>
<P>Now read the <CODE>man</CODE> page of each process to find out what
it does and how to change its behaviour. With this
method, you will most likely find the process that is
responsible. You may also find <CODE>strace</CODE> helpful.
<P>
<P>Please send me an email if you found something new.
