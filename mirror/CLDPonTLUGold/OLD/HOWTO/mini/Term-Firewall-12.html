<P>Some telnet clients and servers agree to encrypt their communications,
to prevent evesdropping on the connection.  Unfortunately, the hack
used above (using the network connection that the telnet client has
set up while the telnet client is idle) won't work in that case.
Instead, one really must go through the telnet client itself, so it
can do its encryption.  It seems like that requires a simple hack to
the telnet client itself, to add a command that runs a process with
its stdin and stdout are connected to the live telnet connection.
This would also be useful for various 'bots, so perhaps someone has
already hacked it up.
