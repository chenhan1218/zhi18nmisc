<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Configuring Linux</A></H2>

<P>After you have wired up the  ANT and you're getting
the sync signal, then you're ready to configure your
Linux System and verify your connection to your ISP. 
Although I will refer to a Linux System, you can connect
any type of 10baseT device to the ANT. This includes
a router, hub, PC, or any other system that you wish to 
use. 
<P><B> Caution!</B> <EM>Before you connect to your ISP</EM>, make sure 
you understand all security issues of having a direct connection
to the Internet via ADSL. Depending on your ISP, most outside uses
can access your systems, and you should setup any firewalls,
deactivate ports/services, and setup any passwords prior to 
connecting your machine to the world.  Read the 
<EM>Security-HOWTO</EM> if you need a good overview
on this subject. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Install and Connect the NIC card</A>
</H2>

<P>Install your NIC card in your Linux machine, 
configure the kernel, etc., etc.  See the various
Linux references for doing this. See the <EM>Ethernet-HOWTO</EM>
for more information.
<P>Connect the RJ45 cable between the NIC and the 
ANT. <B>Note</B> A gotcha here is that some ANTs
are already wired as a 10baseT crossover, and  require a
direct Category 5 cable for a direct connection to
a NIC, rather than a crossover cable.  I lost 
around 12 hours figuring this one out, so don't
make the same mistake -  make sure you read the 
instructions first.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Configure the Ethernet Interface</A>
</H2>

<P>Configure the IP address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, and DNS server
information.  Each Linux Distribution (RH, debian, Slackware, S.U.S.E.) 
has a different way of doing this, so check on your particulars.
You can also do this manually using the <CODE>ifconfig</CODE>
and <CODE>route</CODE> commands. See the <EM>NET3-HOWTO</EM> for information
for more information.   
<P>Once your system is configured, see if you can ping to the 
your default gateway address provided by the ISP.  If
the ping is  successful, the you should see around
20 ms roundtrip delay for this connection.  Congratulations,
you're connected to the Net! 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Setting up a Router</A>
</H2>

<P>Depending on your local setup, you should consider some other issues.
These include a firewall setup, and any associated configurations.
For my setup, shown in Figure 3, 
I use an old i486 machine configured as a firewall/router
between the ADSL connection and the rest of my machines. 
I use private IP addresses on my Private LAN subnet, and have configured
my router to provide IP Masquerading and Firewalling between the LAN
and Internet connection. See the <EM>IP_Masquerading-HOWTO</EM>, and <EM>Firewall-HOWTO</EM> for
more information. My experience is that Linux provides superior 
routing/firewalling performance , and is much cheap than a commercial router,
if you find an old 386/486 machine that you may be using as a doorstop
somewhere.

</PRE>
<P>
<P>What I did is setup a router (Linux RH 5.0  on a i486) with two Ethernet
interfaces.
One interface routes to the ISP subnet/gateway, and the other interface
supports a class private network  address (i.e. 192.168.2.x).   Using the
private
network address behind your router allows some additional security because
it is not
directly addressable from outside your ISP.   You have to explicitly
masquerade your private  addresses in order to
connect to the Internet.
<P><B>Caution</B> Make sure your kernel is complied with IP forwarding
and the IP forwarding is turned on. You can check this by 
<PRE>
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</PRE>

The value is "1" for on, and "0" for off.
You can change this value by echoing the desired value
into this file.
<PRE>
(e.g.) echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</PRE>

Will turn forwarding on.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Setting up a Firewall/Masquerading</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have a direct connection to the Internet,
then you want to also turn on Firewall Administration
and Masquerading. Figure 4 shows a picture of this.
<P><B>Caution!</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I also need to stress that this configuration is only
part of the things that need to be performed to 
create a secure environment. Other considerations include
turning off ftp, telnet, and other services on
the Router, and ensuring all password, login, etc. 
configurations are correctly setup for your environment.
Make sure you read the <EM>Security-HOWTO</EM>.

<P>The kernel for the Linux  router is complied for IP forwarding/masquerading,
and has the "ipfwadm" (IP firewall software) installed 
with the following options:
<P>file: /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall  (called by rc.sysinit in RH5.0)

#
ipfwadm -F -l

ipfwadm -I -l
</PRE>
<P>You need to be careful, as some application will still not work without
special modules (namely ftp, real audio, and some others). Check
the ipfwadm documentation for more information.  I found this pretty easy to
set up.
<P>Additionally, using the private network addressing scheme is cheap, and
gives
an administrator complete flexibility in setting up their local LAN.
The drawback is that Masquerading has a limit on the number of private hosts
that
it can reasonably support, and that some IP applications that pass the host
address
in their data fields will not work, but this tends to be a limited number.
