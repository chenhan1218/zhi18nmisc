<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Wiring it up</A></H2>

<P>If you have ordered the installation option from the Telco, then
you can skip this section and move to &quot; Configuring Linux&quot; .
The following procedures are meant to illustrate the wiring
process. Please note that your procedures may be different
at your location.  Make sure you follow any warnings or safety 
instructions provided, and that you are familiar with Telco 
wiring procedures.
<P>The first step will be to wire up the connections
from your Telco. Identify the line on which service
will be installed, and the locations of your splitter
and DSL jacks. 
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Wire the Splitter/NID (at the SNI)</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have the splitterless design, you
can skip this part.
<P>The splitter will consist of two parts, the splitter and
a small outdoor housing, called the Network Interface Device.
Mount the splitter and NID housing
per the Telcos instructions at the Subscriber Network
Interface (SNI) point, usually the side of your house
where the phone line is located.  The phone company will
need to access the splitter for maintenance, so its advisable
to locate it on the outside where they can get at it.
Connect the incoming 2W Telco line to the &quot; LINE&quot;side of the splitter. Then wire the inside pair for your
telephone to the &quot;VOICE&quot; , and your inside
wire pair for the ANT to &quot;DATA&quot;. 
<P><B>Checkstep </B>
At this point, you should be able to pull dial tone
off the voice side of the splitter. If this doesn't work,
then either you've wired it wrong, or the ADSL service
is not yet connected on the Telco side.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Wire the DSL Jack (at the computer location)</A>
</H2>

<P>Wire up the DSL jack (RJ11)  at your computer location (connected to the
DATA side of the splitter). The specifics differ greatly 
for each situation, but basically you will have a 2 wire pair
that you will connect to the DSL jack. Make sure you
read the directions, as the DSL-RJ11 wiring is different
for phones and ADSL jacks.  In my case, you wire the
phone jack on the red/green pair (the two inside prongs of the
RJ11 jack) and the ADSL jack is wired on the yellow/black
pair (the two outside prongs of the RJ11 jack).  
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Install the ANT (at the computer location)</A>
</H2>

<P>Connect up the ANT's power cord, and connect the phone line
(category 3 cable) between the DSL jack and the ANT. 
This cable is usually provided.  
<P><B>Checkstep </B> At this point, verify the 
ANT syncs up to the Telco signal. Most ANTs
have an green LED that lights up when the signal is good.
If it doesn't sync, then check your wiring, or make sure
that the Telco signal is being sent (do this by calling
your Telco and verifying they have activated the service. Note
that having dial tone on the line does NOT confirm the
presence of the ADSL data signal.)
<P>If you have completed the previous steps, you are now
ready to move on to connecting your Linux System.
