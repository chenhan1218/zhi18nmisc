</H2>

<P>This is the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section for
ADSL.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Q: Are there ADSL Standards.
<P>A: Sort of. The U.S. Bell Operating Companies have standardized on
Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) ANTs (ANSI T1.413)  in their current rollout.  
Most others should follow their lead in the states. There
are other types of ANTs, most notably Carrier-less Amplitude
Phase Modulation (CAP), which, of course, are incompatible
with each other.  
<P>A biased comparison from an DMT-based vendor on this subject
can be found at the 
<A HREF="http://www.aware.com">Aware</A>.
Still, it provides the best detail on this issue I have seen so far.
<P>A rather expensive copy of the ANSI standard can be ordered at:
American National Standards Institute 
<A HREF="http://www.ansi.org">ANSI Home Page</A> <BR>
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) Metallic Interface <BR>
ANSI TI.413-1995  <BR>
Note: ANSI TI.413 Issue 2 was released September 26, 1997 <BR>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Q: Can I use ATM to connect to ADSL ANT?
<P>A: Yes, you can! Some ADSL ANT (at least the Alcatel
version) has a ATM Forum 25Mbps interface,   
which connects to a PCI NIC card. However, I have not 
yet heard of any Linux drivers for such cards.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Q: Why the heck does ADSL have all these bit rates (384/1.5/8M/20M/etc) options?
<P>A: The basic problem is the 100 year old design of the copper loop. 
It works great for analog phone, but it presents a real challenge
for a digital signal. Remember that the distance of 
a loop is inversely proportional
to the data rate that it can carry.  Rate-Adaptive technologies are great for
making a digital signal work in many situations, but it can't provide
a consistent bandwidth for all applications, especially for very long
(over 18 kilofeet) loops.  The different bandwidth that you see
advertised reflect various marketing wars of vendors equipment,
and the Telco struggle to finalize on a ''standard'' set of
data rates.  I think that the 384k/1.5Mbps will become the standard
for now. The high bit rates will only be available for special application
and/or situations, since they can only be provided on a small percentage
of the available loops.
<P>Also, check out the next question on the loop imparments that cause
this to happen.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Q: What are all these loop imparments (bridge taps, loading coils)
that could disqualify my line from using ADSL? (thanks to Bruce Ediger) 
<P>Load coils: in-line inductances that improve voice-frequency transmission
characteristics of a telephone circuit.  Essentially, a "load" steals
energy from high frequencies and gives it to lower frequencies.  Typically
only used in very long (>9,000 ft) phone lines.
<P>By "bridges" I assume you mean "bridged taps".  In older neighborhoods,
the phone wiring will have been used by more than one customer.  Perhaps
these customers lived at different (though near-by) addresses.  The unconnected
"spur" of wiring is a "bridged tab" on the currently connected circuit.
<P>Digital loop carriers: there's a bunch of systems for carrying more than
one voice transmission on a single pair of wires.  You can shift the
frequencies up or down, or you can digitize the voice transmissions and
divide the telephone circuit by time or code or something.  The more
general term is "pair gain".
<P>These things cause different problems for high-frequency communication.
<P>Loads will completely mess up things by filtering high frequencies and
passing low frequencies.  They probably also change the "delay envelope",
allowing some frequencies to arrive before others.  One byte's tones will
interfere with the next byte's.
<P>Bridged taps act as shunt capacitances if they're long in relation to the
signals wavelength, and they'll actually act as band pass filters if
they're about 1/4 wavelength of the signal.  That is, they'll pass
particular frequencies freely.  Particular tones of a DMT modem might
get shunted back, rather than passed along to the receiving modem,
reducing bandwidth for that telephone line.
<P>Pair gain, digital or analog, limit the bandwidth available to one transmission
in order to multiplex several on one wire.  High and low tones of a DMT
transmission get filtered out by the apparatus.
<P>The book "Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook", by Whitham
D. Reeve, , IEEE Press 1992, ISBN 0-87942-274-2 covers the math of how to
calculate the effect of line length, bridged tap, etc on the transmission
characteristics of a telephone line.  It's pretty expensive, however.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Q: Do you have examples of ADSL ANTs?
<P>A: Short Answer: Yes. Real Answer: The evolution of this technology
is  moving too rapidly for anyone to keep up to date in a HOWTO.
A good source of ADSL ANTs is the 
<A HREF="http://www.adsl.com"> ADSL Forum Home Page </A>.
Go to the Vendors pages to see what's happening.
<P>However, I will provide a list of some of the current
technology as of June 1998.
