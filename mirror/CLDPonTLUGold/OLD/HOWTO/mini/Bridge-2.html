<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

ioctl(SIOCGIFBR) failed: Package not installed

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

What does this mean?
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>You don't have bridging capability in your kernel.
Get a 2.0 or greater kernel,
and recompile with the <CODE>BRIDGING</CODE> option enabled.

<DT><B>Question</B><DD><P>Machines on one side cannot ping the other side!
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>
<UL>
<LI>Did you enable bridging using ``<CODE>brcfg -ena</CODE>''?
(<CODE>brcfg</CODE> should say ``<CODE>bridging is ENABLED</CODE>'')</LI>
<LI>Did you put the interfaces into promiscuous mode?
(issue the ``<CODE>ifconfig</CODE>'' command.
The ``<CODE>PROMISC</CODE>'' flag should be on for
both interfaces.)</LI>
<LI>If using multiple-media interface adapters,
make sure that the correct one is enabled.
You may need to use the config/setup program that
came with the network interface card.</LI>

<DT><B>Question</B><DD><P>I cannot <CODE>telnet</CODE>/<CODE>ftp</CODE> from the bridge! Why?
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>This is because there is no IP address bound to any of bridge
interfaces.  A bridge is to be a transparent part of a network.

<DT><B>Question</B><DD><P>What do I need to set up in the way of routing?
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>Nothing!
All routing intelligence is handled by
the bridging code in the kernel.
To see the ethernet addresses as they are learned by the bridge,
use the <CODE>brcfg</CODE> program in debug mode:

<DT><B>Question</B><DD><P>The bridge appears to work, but why doesn't ``traceroute'' show the
bridge as a part of the path?
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>Due to the nature of a bridge, a ``traceroute'' should NOT show the
bridge as a part of the path. A bridge is to be a transparent
component of the network.

<DT><B>Question</B><DD><P>Is it necessary to compile <CODE>IP_FORWARD</CODE> into the kernel?
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>No. The bridging code in the kernel takes care of the packet
transport.
<CODE>IP_FORWARD</CODE> is for a gateway which has IP addresses
bound to its interfaces.
</DL>

</LI>
<LI>
<DL>
<DT><B>Question</B><DD><P>Why are the physical ethernet addresses for port 1 and port 2 the
same according to the ``<CODE>brcfg</CODE>'' program?
Shouldn't they be different?
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>No. Every port on a bridge intentionally is assigned the same
physical ethernet address by the bridging code.
</DL>

<LI>
<DL>
<DT><B>Question</B><DD><P>Bridging does not appear to be an option when performing a make
config on the kernel.  How does one enable it?
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>During the kernel config, answer 'Y' to the question, ``Prompt for
development and/or incomplete code/drivers (CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL) 
[Y/n/?]''.

<DT><B>Question</B><DD><P>Too many hubs (4 or more) chained one after another (in series) 
cause timing problems on an ethernet.  What effect does a bridge
have in a subnet that is layered with hubs?
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>A bridge resets the 3/4/5 hubs rule.  A bridge does not deal with
packets the way a hub does, and is therefore not a contributor to
timing problems on a network.

<DT><B>Question</B><DD><P>Can a bridge interface to both 10Mb and 100Mb ethernet segments?
Will such a configuration slow down the rest of the traffic on the
high speed side?
<DT><B>Answer</B><DD><P>Yes, a bridge can tie together a 10Mb segment with a 100Mb segment.
As long as the network card on the fast network is 100Mb capable,
TCP takes care of the rest.  While it's true that the
packets from a host in the 100Mb network communicating to a host
in the 10Mb network are moving at only 10Mb/s, the rest of the
traffic on the fast ethernet is not slowed down.
