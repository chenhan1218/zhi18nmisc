<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is this?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This is a Linux Mini-HOWTO text. A Mini-HOWTO is a small text
explaining some business related to Linux installation and
maintenance tutorial style. It's mini, because either the text
or the topic it discusses are too small for a real HOWTO or even
a book. A HOWTO is not a reference:  that's what manual pages
are for.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What is in it? and related HOWTO documents</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This particular Mini-HOWTO teaches you how to plan and layout
disk space for your Linux system. It talks about disk hardware,
partitions, swap space sizing and positioning considerations,
file systems, file system types and related topics. The intent
is to teach some background knowlegde, so we are talking mainly
principles and not tools in this text. 
<P>Ideally, this document should be read before your first
installation, but this is somehow difficult for most people.
First timers have other problems than disk layout optimization,
too. So you are probably someone who just finished a Linux
installation and is now thinking about ways to optimize this
installation or how to avoid some nasty miscalculations in the
next one. Well, expect some desire to tear down and rebuild
your installation when you are finished with this text. :-)
<P>
<P>This Mini-HOWTO limits itself to planning and layouting disk
space most of the time. It does not discuss the usage of fdisk,
LILO, mke2fs or backup programs. There are other HOWTOs that
address these problems. Please see the Linux HOWTO Index for
current information on Linux HOWTOs. There are instructions for
obtaining HOWTO documents in the index, too.
<P>To learn how to estimate the various size and speed requirements
for different parts of the filesystem, see "Linux Multiple Disks 
Layout mini-HOWTO", by Gjoen Stein &lt;gjoen@nyx.net&gt;.
<P>For instructions and considerations regarding disks with more
than 1024 cylinders, see "Linux Large Disk mini-HOWTO", Andries
Brouwer &lt;aeb@cwi.nl&gt;.
<P>For instructions on limiting disk space usage per user
(quotas), see "Linux Quota mini-HOWTO", by Albert M.C. Tam
&lt;bertie@scn.org&gt;
<P>Currently, there is no general document on disk backup, but
there are several documents with pointers to specific backup
solutions. See "Linux ADSM Backup mini-HOWTO", by Thomas Koenig
&lt;Thomas.Koenig@ciw.uni-karlsruhe.de&gt; for instructions on
integrating Linux into an IBM ADSM backup environment. See
"Linux Backup with MSDOS mini-HOWTO", by Christopher Neufeld
&lt;neufeld@physics.utoronto.ca&gt; for information about MS-DOS
driven Linux backups.
<P>For instructions on writing and submitting a HOWTO document, see
the Linux HOWTO Index, by Tim Bynum &lt;linux-howto@sunsite.unc.edu&gt;.
<P>Browsing through /usr/src/linux/Documentation can be very
instructive, too. See ide.txt and scsi.txt for some background
information on the properties of your disk drivers and have a
look at the filesystems/ subdirectory.
