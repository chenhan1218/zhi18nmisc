<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Why is there a problem ?</A></H2>

<P>Problem is all the installed Operating Systems must share the disks and
as at start the bios only scan the first one, there must be a so called "partition
table" in the very beginning of this disk. This partition table is located in
the Master Boot Record (MBR) side by side with the boot loader.
<P>Any misuse of the MBR by any of the OS's leads to problems. When trying
to install any system, yes answer at a question like "automatic partitioning ?"
is likely to give problems... This is specially true with windows, especially
with custom windows installation made by special makes PC's (when no true "windows"
cd is included). But it's also true with new "smart" (not so smart !) Linux installation
programs given with most recent distributions.
