                      Linux pre-installation checklist

   Are you a Linux newbie ? Are you a Linux guru ? In both cases, you
       will find this checklist of great help to you.
       How many times have you found yourself fumbling in the middle of a
       Linux installation process, because some vital information about
       the target hardware is not known ?
       Have you ever crossed your fingers when you were asked by the
       installation procedure, a simple question, like: "to which COM
       port is the mouse connected ?
       Let's face it, all of us have, at one time or another, felt we
       should have been better prepared before starting to install Linux.
       Here is a simple solution, brought to you by

  What does this checklist (aim to) achieve ?
  
   This is an aide-memoire which may make installation of Linux a
   pleasant experience for you. It fills an important role in the
   promotion of Linux.
   It will help you to be prepared with all the answers which may be
   needed during the course of installation of Linux on your machine or
   on anybody else's machine. Sometimes, it is very inconvenient and even
   impossible to find out some details in the middle of an installation
   procedure. This becomes all the more difficult when you are installing
   Linux on somebody else's machine, and in somebody else's office.
   This checklist, when filled up, will help you go through your Linux
   documentation and verify in advance whether certain hardware is
   supported by the distribution you are planning to install. It will
   also help you to be prepared with the packages you would need to
   install, and the configuration choices which need to be done.
   The idea is to reduce the chances of frustrating surprises.
   This checklist is only for installing Linux on PCs. You may use this
   checklist as a model for other classes of machines (e.g.SUN, Alpha,
   ...) also.
   
  Where do I find more about Linux ?
  
   If you want professional (PAID) help with Linux -- [12]ask Algologic.
   Algologic Research & Solutions is listed in the official
   CONSULTANTS-HOWTO of the Linux Documentation Project.
   This checklist does not give any details about hardware compatible
   with Linux, or other details about actually procuring or installing
   Linux. If you want details, [13]just click here.
   If you are the impatient type, and want help on installation directly,
   [14]click here and jump the pre-installation checklist.
   ATTENTION: We are actually overwhelmed by the number of general
   queries about procuring, installing and using Linux. We DO NOT answer
   such general mail. We strongly advise you to [15]click here for
   finding other sources of help. Please DO NOT send us any general Linux
   queries.

  Who must use this checklist ?
  
     * If you are planning to install Linux on somebody else's machine,
       or in a location which is not your own work place, you must
       absolutely get this checklist completed in advance. It is
       important to get this questionnaire answered by your host, so that
       you go adequately prepared for the installation.
     * If you are planning to organise an "Install fest" (we Indians call
       it "Linux mela"), ask your participants to come with this
       checklist answered.
     * Conversely, if you are going to an Install fest (aka Linux mela),
       to get Linux installed on your machine, do your home-work. Go with
       answers to this checklist.
     * If you are going to ask someone to come over and install Linux for
       you, send him/her this questionnaire with as many responses as you
       know.
     * If you are the D-I-Y type, you must start by answering all these
       questions, so that you can save time for enjoying your Linux !

    -------------------------------------------------------------

                               Welcome

    Welcome to the world of Linux. Your first step in  installing
    Linux on your PC will begin by answering a few (?), simple(?)
    questions about your hardware.

    This  is a FREE service from Algologic. Algologic offers   no
    warranties, and accepts no liabilities in  this exercise. You
    are using this checklist at your own risk and responsibility.

    This checklist will make it easy for you and us to go through
    the  installation, painlessly and without  surprises.  Please
    take  your  own  time and fill up  the  following  checklist.
    Wherever   possible,  and  necessary,  we  have  given   some
    suggestions and hints, for your convenience.

    If you don't know all the details, you should be able to find
    them  in  your  computer's manuals.  Or,  ask  your  hardware
    vendor, or your local hardware "guru".

    If  you still have problems finding answers, don't  worry  --
    you   can  just  ignore any areas you don't know.  Bring   in
    your   machine  and  ALL manuals you have.  The  installation
    may succeed with some trials and  a lot of luck.

    Remember,  Linux,  like many other software  products,  is  a
    growing  product.  Some  of your hardware may  still  not  be
    supported  in  the version of Linux which is being installed.

    Each question below can be identified by a letter followed by
    a number  (e.g. G3 is a question on processor speed). If  you
    need any assistance/clarifications about the questions  asked
    in this form, please specify the chapter identifier (an alpha)
    and the question number (a numeral), and send an e mail to:

                       algolog@hd1.vsnl.net.in

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Assumptions:

    1. You  are  interested  in installing Linux  on  a  PC  (386
       upwards).

    2. You have a CDROM drive on your PC. You have made sure that
       your proposed  version of Linux supports this CDROM drive.
       Check  latest  version of Hardware HOWTO of the Linux
       Documentation Project (LDP).

    3. You  have at least one 3.5" floppy diskette drive  on
       your system.

    4. The 3.5" diskette drive is a BOOTABLE drive.

    5. You will keep readily available, three,   bad-sector-free,
       formatted  (3.5"), blank   diskettes,  for use in the
       installation procedure.

    6. If you wish to install   Linux   over  a   LAN,  you  have
       confirmed  that your network interface card  is  supported
       by your version of Linux. Check latest version of Hardware
       HOWTO of LDP.

           tape drive?

    _____________________________________________________________

    D. DISK

    Useful tips: At this point, you must be clear  about  how your
    Linux will be  installed and  on which disk etc. You must also
    be   clear   how  your  Linux   will  be   booted  (there are
    different possibilities).

    Read the  installation  HOWTO before you answer the following
    questions.


        1* What type of drive do you have [IDE, SCSI, RLL, MFM ....] ?

        2* How many partitions are there on your first disk drive ?

           disk drives you may have on this machine.

        3* On which drive are you planning to install Linux (e.g. drive
           2 of first IDE, or SCSI-ID 5 of built-in SCSI interface)

           will be lost)

        5* Which  partitions can be reformatted to  become  Linux

           [50 MB minimum] ?

        7* What is your second hard disk (if any)?
