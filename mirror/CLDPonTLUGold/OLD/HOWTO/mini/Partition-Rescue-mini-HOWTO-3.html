<P>I am not responsible of any damage on any computer as a result of anyone
reading this HOWTO. If you do any damage, _it is YOUR fault, NOT MINE !_ Be
careful when partitioning disks, and don't make any mistakes, because it can
be fatal ! Backup all your important data and check that everything you do is
correct ! What is described here worked on my computer, but it may or may not
work on your computer. Although it should work for everyone, I can't guarantee
anything. This is the last warning you get : _BACKUP IMPORTANT DATA !_ Or, to
put it short: Use at your own risk !
