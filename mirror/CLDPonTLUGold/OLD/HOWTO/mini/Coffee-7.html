</H2>

<P>This document was initially written as part of
a small debate in the linux-greek-users list , 
whether linux can make coffee or not.
It has been an article in our beautiful online magazine
about Linux called 
<A HREF="http://www.linux.gr/magaz">magaz</A>.
Remember, that magaz is greek it will look like that to you.

<P>The casual copyright with everything you get with linux...

<LI>Ethiopia: Identified as the originating country of coffee.
As many people corrected, coffee did not originally come from America 
nor was brought by Christofer Colombus. It was popular in the Middle East long
before America was discovered. Still, we can remember 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/1492.exhibit/c-Columbus/columbus.html">Cristobal Colon</A>, as the person who brought tobacco and chocolate in Europe.</LI>
<LI> Kostas Lialiambis is the one who dared saying that he can't make 
coffee with his Linux box.</LI>
<LI> Panagiotis Vrionis, Yannakopoulos Haralambos, for giving me
interesting and humorous notes.</LI>
<LI> NUMEROUS people on the internet with additions and remarks.</LI>
