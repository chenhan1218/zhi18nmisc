<P>You found all the software you needed.  Now let's install them.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 AIX License</A>
</H2>

<P>Before making the tarball on the aix machine, make sure you run
/usr/netstation/bin/agree in order to make the kernel in a usable format.
Probably you will have to do the same thing with the tarball you get from
the IBM website.  So finding the kernel separatly might be another
solution.
Find some drive with about 25Mb of free diskspace, I use /usr/netstation/,
and unpack the tarbal either from the IBM website or from an AIX machine.
There is no need in leaving the approx 60Mb from /usr/netstation/doc on
the disk if you don't have enough diskspace.

<H3>Setting up the nfs server</H3>

<P>Edit your /etc/exports,
add the line
/usr/netstation   10.0.0.50(rw)
Where 10.0.0.50 is the ipnr you want to give to the NC.
Restart your nfs deamon.
<P>[root@velvet sdog]# ps auxf |grep rpc
sdog      4145  0.0  5.8   828   384  p1 S   03:55   0:00          \_ grep rpc

root      3129  0.0  1.5   880   100  ?  S  Feb 27   0:10 rpc.nfsd 
[root@velvet sdog]# kill -9 3120 3129 ; /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd ;
/usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd
<P>or on a RedHat alike system easier
<P>[root@velvet init.d]# pwd
/etc/rc.d/init.d
[root@velvet init.d]# ./nfs restart
Restarting NFS services: rpc.nfsd rpc.mountd done.

<P>Your NC should now be able to mount the /usr/netsation by NFS.
<P>Bascially if you don`t need X-Windows this is as far as it gets.  You can
easily telnet from your NC with nothing more installed.  Hoever the beauty
of this thing is it`s X capacities
<H3>Setting up the X server</H3>

<P>Next we have to set up the X server.  Basically I didn`t need to set up
anything, all of my machines that ran X-Windows were configured to accept
connections.  I just started up the NC for the first time and it showed me
all the machines that ran an XDM (cfr running an X -indirect).  So any
machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.  Just make sure XDM is
So any machine that can run xdm can be used as X Server.  Just make sure
XDM is started.  
<P> Everything on the server side should be setup now. 
Lets try the NC side.
