<P>This Mini-HOWTO has been largely derived from the Swap-Space Mini HOWTO by
<B>H. Peter Anvin</B>. I have added the Windows 95/98 specific details as 
well as a few Red Hat Linux specific details. The msinfo program given in the 
original HOWTO didn't work on my Red Hat Linux 6 system, so I created a similar  
program. However, I have also included the original msinfo program. Thanks to  all 
those <B>great people involved with the development of Linux</B>,to the 
people  at <B>Red Hat</B> for giving a great Linux distribution and to <B>Sanjiv Guha</B>, one of the  co-authors of "Red Hat Linux 6 Unleashed" from 
Techmedia for guidance about  shell programming. Thanks also to <B>Matt Welsh</B>,<B> Greg Hankins</B> and <B>Eric S. Raymond</B>, the authors of 
SGML-Tool's Users Guide, which helped me in converting the document in SGML 
format. Thanks are also to <B>Peter Norton</B> and <B>John Goodman</B>
for there venerable "Peter Norton's Inside the PC", which helped me about
DOS file system structure. Finally, thanks to <B>PC Quest Linux Project</B>
for bringing out Linux  CDROMS frequently.
<P>I rely on you, the readers, to make this HOWTO useful. If you have any
suggestions, comments, corrections, requests, flames, etc., feel free to
contact me. Right now, I have no internet access, but still you contact me
in case of questions at my 
<A HREF="mailto:jurahul@hotmail.com">Hotmail</A> 
account (Hey! Don't blame me for using a Microsoft service. Hotmail was 
created by our Indian guy Sabeer Bhatia). May be someone from you local  place may also come to your rescue.If 
you find my account unoperational and your problem is indeed important, you may
mail me at

<P>Finally, I would like to dedicate this work to <B>Robert Lafore</B>, the
author of excellent books "C programming using Turbo C++" and "Object
Oriented Programming using Turbo C++".
<P>Enjoy Linux,
<P>Rahul :-)
