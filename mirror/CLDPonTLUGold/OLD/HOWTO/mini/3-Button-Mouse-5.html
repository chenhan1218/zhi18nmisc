<P>If you don't have any switches, and no instructions, then a little bit of
experimentation is needed.
The first thing to try is to assume the mouse maker is telling the truth,
and the mouse is full Microsoft. Set up your Xconfigs to expect a Microsoft
mouse (see the 
<A HREF="#config">Xconfig section</A>) and give it a try.
<P>
<P>If the mouse didn't work at all, then you don't have a Microsoft mouse, or
there is some other problem. Try the other protocols in the configs, the
man page for the config file is the best place to start looking. Also look
in the 
<A HREF="#misc">Miscellaneous Problems</A> section below.
<P>
<P>What you will probably find is that when you run X, the mouse works fine but
only the outer two buttons do anything.  You can of course accept this,
and emulate the third button (press both buttons at once to click the
middle one) like you do with a two button mouse. To do this, change your
Xconfig file as shown in the 
<A HREF="#config">Xconfig example</A>
section below.  This may mean you
have bought a 3 button mouse for no good reason, and you are certainly
no further forward. So, now you need to look at your hardware.
