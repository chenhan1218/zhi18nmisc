</H2>

<P>Some obvious things are required, such as a computer, USB ports, hand 
visor (and USB cradle), Linux, etc. You also should know how to compile
and install stuff, like the kernel.  If you do not, perhaps the
kernel-HOWTO will be helpful: 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html</A>.
<H2><A NAME="kernel"></A> <A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Kernel Stuff</A>
</H2>

<P>First, you will need to get a kernel which supports USB. You can either
get the "latest" development kernel, which is version 2.4.0-test5
(as of this writing, Aug 7, 2000).
You may get the latest version from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/">ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/</A>. 
Otherwise you need to get the latest stable kernel version, and the
latest backport of the USB code. The latest (as of Aug 7, 2000) stable kernel is
2.2.16, and can be gotten from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/">ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/</A>. The latest backport can be gotten from
the linux-usb project, and is found here: 
<A HREF="http://www.suse.cz/development/usb-backport/">http://www.suse.cz/development/usb-backport/</A>
The current version (Aug 7, 2000) is: usb-2.4.0-test2-pre2-for-2.2.16-v3.
There may be patches to the backport available. You should be able
to find them at 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=1404">http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=1404</A>.
Download and install the source, including the usb back port if you
are using version 2.2.  Below shows an example of installing the
the 2.2 source code, and the backport.
<P>
<PRE>
cd /usr/src
tar xzvf linux-2.2.14.tar.gz
cd linux
gzip -dc ../usb-2.3.50-1-for-2.2.14.diff.gz | patch -p1
make distclean
</PRE>
<P>Next, a critical step, is determining which type of USB host controller 
you have. The USB host controller is the hardware in your computer
which handles USB input/output. Intel chipset motherboards, i.e. the 
BX chipset, are typically UHCI controllers. Most addon cards are OHCI 
controllers. You can determine the type of USB hardware available by 
using: 'lspci -v'. (See the Links/References if you do not 
have lspci). If you see something like:
<P>
<PRE>
    USB Controller: ......
    Flags: .....
    I/O ports at ....
</PRE>
<P>Then you have a UHCI based controller.  If you see something like:
<P>
<PRE>
     USB Controller: .....
     Flags: ....
     Memory at .....
</PRE>
<P>Then you have a OHCI based controller.  (Documentation to figure
out type type of controller was leached from the kernel documentation,
Documentation/usb/scanner.txt). You could 
refer to 
<A HREF="http://www.linux-usb.org">http://www.linux-usb.org</A> for further details. The kernel 
documentation in the directory (Documentation/usb/usb.txt) may also be 
helpful in determining which type of controller you have. 
<P>If you dont have a USB controller you need either buy the serial
cradle for the Visor (what are you doing reading this?), or buy
a USB-capable device (ie. add-on card or motherboard).  
<P>Now we need to configure, and make your kernel. During configuration,
make sure you enable:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>USB support (CONFIG_USB), </LI>
<LI>the appropriate controller - UHCI, alternate UHCI, or OHCI (CONFIG_USB_UHCI, CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT, or CONFIG_USB_OHCI) </LI>
<LI>USB Serial Converter support (CONFIG_USB_SERIAL) </LI>
<LI>USB Handspring Visor Driver (CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_VISOR) (serial converter's sub-option) </LI>
</UL>
<P>(I'm not sure what the difference between UHCI drivers are, nor which
one is recommended for use. Anyone?)
I have compiled these into the kernel, and as modules. Both work.
The developer(s) prefer the module method, but that is up to you.
<P>After you did that, finish installing your kernel, and reboot.
<P>Not done yet! To make the Visor driver work, we need to finish making
the USB Serial driver to work. For that, you can refer to the 
Linux Kernel Documentation: Documentation/usb/usb-serial.txt. 
Basically, what it tells you to do is to make the devices. You can do 
this by excuting the commands, as root: 
<P>
<PRE>
mknod /dev/ttyUSB0 c 188 0
mknod /dev/ttyUSB1 c 188 1
etc...
chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB*
</PRE>
<P>Right now the code is limited to 16 connections/ports/devices, so 
only 0 to 15 need to be done. The chmod is to allow users to be able
to access the Visor device.  It is the opinion of the author of this 
document that this should be save for a personal computer. Multiuser
computers may want to look into this.
<P>When a Visor connects, there are two "ports" opened. (For most
people, this will be /dev/ttyUSB0, and /dev/ttyUSB1 or similar).
The first port (zero), is a generic connection. The second port
is the hotsync port. This feautre allows for future developments,
like, for example, to export a filesystem from the Visor. A usefull 
thing to do is to create a link to the hotsync port so that 
synchronization software will use the approriate device be default. 
You can do this by:
<P>
<PRE>
cd /dev
ln -s /dev/ttyUSB1 pilot
</PRE>
<P>Just for fun, you might also want to create a link from /dev/visor to 
/dev/ttyUSB1, just, well, because we have a visor, not a pilot 
(or Palm(tm)). The actual device number may change, depending on how
many (active?) USB-serial devices you have on your system. A message
containg the device actually used is displayed when the craddle 
hotsync button is pressed.
<P>For people who compiled the USB code in as modules, you will also need
to insert the modules into the running kernel. As root, run:
<P>
<PRE>
/sbin/modprobe usb-uhci 
/sbin/modprobe usb-ohci
/sbin/modprobe usb-serial
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="coldsync"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Installing ColdSync</A>
</H2>

<P>ColdSync is a software package which contains programs to 
talk with you're Visor (or your Palm(tm), if you have one of those).
Another relatively popular package to do this is pilot-link. However,
there seems to be some bugs in how
pilot-link works, especially with the USB drivers. Thus ColdSync
is the recommended package. UHCI-based systems seem to be working
completely fine with coldsync, while OHCI-based systems still seem
to have some problems. (Both are worse using pilot-link). For details,
look at the visorusb devel list: 
<A HREF="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/1169/">http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/1169/</A>.
<P>As of this writing (aug 7, 2000), the latest stable version of 
ColdSync is 1.2.5.  The latest version (as far as I know) of pilot-link,
is 0.9.3. The one advantage of pilot-link is that there are more
graphical interfaces which use the pilot-link libraries than coldsync.
<P>The programs can be found here:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync/">http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync/</A></LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/pilot-link.0.9.3.tar.gz">ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/pilot-link.0.9.3.tar.gz</A>
or perhaps: 
<A HREF="http://pilot-link.sourceforge.net/">http://pilot-link.sourceforge.net/</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>Download and install the program you wish to use. (coldsync has some
INSTALL notes, which you should read.)
<P>
<PRE>
cd /usr/src
gzip -dc coldsync-1.2.5.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd coldsync-1.2.5
./configure 
make
make install
</PRE>
<P>If you choose to be lazy, there are probably redhat and debian packages
which you may download and install. I dont support those.
<H2><A NAME="testing"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Almost Done! (aka testing)</A>
</H2>

<P>We are pretty much done. Now we need to test it. Of course, the visor 
needs to be in the cradle, and the cradle needs to be plugged into 
your USB port. 
<P>To test, we can use the coldsync. For the computer to 
realize that the visor really is there, you need to hit the hotsync 
button on the cradle. (When a USB device connects, I've noticed that a 
bunch of info is dumped to the screen. Update: this is when debugging
is enabled). Eventually, the visor driver will make an entry into the
/proc/drivers/visor, which will list the minor number and purpose.
More on that later. Then you can run coldsync: 
<P>
<PRE>
coldsync -p /dev/visor 
</PRE>
<P>(Remember, /dev/visor is a symbolic link to /dev/ttyUSB1). 
From here, use other documentation. Manpages are useful.
