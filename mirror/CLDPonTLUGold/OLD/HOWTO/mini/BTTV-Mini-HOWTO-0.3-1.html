<P>The ability to capture and view  video sources is one of the more interesting multimedia
features of Linux.  Many different types of video devices are supported via the 
video4linux API (
<A HREF="http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4l.shtml">http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4l.shtml</A>),
including several TV tuner cards based on the Conexant bt848 and bt878 chipsets.  
This document explains how to use these cards on a Linux system.

<P>Thanks to Ralph Metzler and Marcus Metzler for writing the original bttv driver.
Also, Alan Cox for creating the Video4Linux API, Gerd Knorr for his 
work on the radio cards, subsequent bttv releases, and xawtv.  And everyone else 
who contributed to Linux support for these cards.  Thanks to
William Burrow, who also wrote a BTTV Howto (which I learned about <EM>after</EM>
I wrote this document...)  I have improved this guide, thanks to his work.
<P>In writing this HOWTO I have drawn heavily on the bttv and xawtv documentation.
