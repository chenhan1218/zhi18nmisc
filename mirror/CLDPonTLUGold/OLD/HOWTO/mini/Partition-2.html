<H2><A NAME="s2">2. What is a partition anyway?</A></H2>

<P>
<P>When PC hard disks were invented people soon wanted to install
multiple operating systems, even if their system had only one
disk.  So a mechanism was needed to divide a single physical
disk into multiple logical disks. So that's what a partition
is: A contiguous section of blocks on your hard disk that is
treated like a completely seperate disk by most operating
systems.
<P>It is fairly clear that partitions must not overlap: An
operating system will certainly not be pleased, if another
operating system installed on the same machine were overwriting
important information because of overlapping partitions. There
should be no gap between adjacent partitions, too. While this
constellation is not harmful, you are wasting precious disk
space by leaving space between partitions.
<P>A disk need not be partitioned completely. You may decide to
leave some space at the end of your disk that is not assigned
to any of your installed operating systems, yet. Later, when it
is clear which installation is used by you most of the time,
you can partition this left over space and put a file system on
it.
<P>
<P>Partitions can not be moved nor can they be resized without
destroying the file system contained in it. So repartitioning
usually involves backup and restore of all file systems touched
during the repartitioning.  In fact it is fairly common to mess
up things completely during repartitioning, so you should back
up anything on any disk on that particular machine before even
touching things like <CODE>fdisk</CODE>.
<P>Well, some partitions with certain file system types on them
actually <EM>can</EM> be split into two without losing any data (if
you are lucky). For example there is a program called "fips"
for splitting MS-DOS partitions into two to make room for a
Linux installation without having to reinstall MS-DOS. You are
still not going to touch these things without carefully backing
up everything on that machine, aren't you? 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Backups are important</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Tapes are your friend for backups. They are fast, reliable and
easy to use, so you can make backups often, preferably
automatically and without hassle.
<P>Step on soapbox: And I am talking about real tapes, not that
disk controller driven ftape crap. Consider buying SCSI: Linux
does support SCSI natively. You don't need to load ASPI
drivers, you are not losing precious HMA under Linux and once
the SCSI host adapter is installed, you just attach additional
disks, tapes and CD-ROMs to it. No more I/O addresses, IRQ
juggling or Master/Slave and PIO-level matching. 
<P>Plus: Proper SCSI host adapters give you high I/O performance
without much CPU load. Even under heavy disk activity you will
experience good response times. If you are planning to use a
Linux system as a major USENET news feed or if you are about to
enter the ISP business, don't even think about deploying a
system without SCSI. Climb of soapbox.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Device numbers and device names</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The number of partitions on an Intel based system was limited
from the very beginning: The original partition table was
installed as part of the boot sector and held space for only
four partition entries.  These partitions are now called primary
partitions. When it became clear that people needed more
partitions on their systems, logical partitions were invented.
The number of logical partitions is not limited: Each logical
partition contains a pointer to the next logical partition,
so you can have a potentially unlimited chain of partition
entries.
<P>For compatibility reasons, the space occupied by all logical
partitions had to be accounted for. If you are using logical
partitions, one primary partition entry is marked as "extended
partition" and its starting and ending block mark the area
occupied by your logical partitions. This implies that the
space assigned to all logical partitions has to be contiguous. 
There can be only one extended partition: no <CODE>fdisk</CODE> program
will create more than one extended partition.
<P>Linux cannot handle more than a limited number of partitions per
drive. So in Linux you have 4 primary partitions (3 of them
useable, if you are using logical partitions) and at most 15
partitions altogether on an SCSI disk (63 altogether on an IDE
disk).
<P>In Linux, partitions are represented by device files. A device
file is a file with type c (for "character" devices, devices
that do not use the buffer cache) or b (for "block" devices,
which go through the buffer cache). In Linux, all disks are
represented as block devices only. Unlike other Unices, Linux
does not offer "raw" character versions of disks and their
partitions.
<P>The only important thing with a device file are its major and
minor device number, shown instead of the files size:

$ ls -l /dev/hda
brw-rw----   1 root     disk       3,   0 Jul 18  1994 /dev/hda
                                   ^    ^
                                   |    minor device number
                                   major device number
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When accessing a device file, the major number selects which
device driver is being called to perform the input/output
operation. This call is being done with the minor number as a
parameter and it is entirely up to the driver how the minor
number is being interpreted. The driver documentation usually
describes how the driver uses minor numbers. For IDE disks,
this documentation is in <CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/ide.txt</CODE>.
For SCSI disks, one would expect such documentation in
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/scsi.txt</CODE>, but it isn't there. One
has to look at the driver source to be sure
(<CODE>/usr/src/linux/driver/scsi/sd.c:184-196</CODE>). Fortunately, there
is Peter Anvin's list of device numbers and names in
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt</CODE>; see the entries for
block devices, major 3, 22, 33, 34 for IDE and major 8 for SCSI
disks. The major and minor numbers are a byte each and that is
why the number of partitions per disk is limited.
<P>By convention device files have certain names and many system
programs have knowledge about these names compiled in. They
expect your IDE disks to be named <CODE>/dev/hd*</CODE> and your SCSI disks
to be named <CODE>/dev/sd*</CODE>. Disks are numbered a, b, c and so on, so
<CODE>/dev/hda</CODE> is your first IDE disk and <CODE>/dev/sda</CODE> is your first SCSI
disk. Both devices represent entire disks, starting at block
one.  Writing to these devices with the wrong tools will
destroy the master boot loader and partition table on these
disks, rendering all data on this disk unusable or making your
system unbootable. Know what you are doing and, again, back up
before you do it.
<P>Primary partitions on a disk are 1, 2, 3 and 4. So <CODE>/dev/hda1</CODE> is
the first primary partition on the first IDE disk and so on.
Logical partitions have numbers 5 and up, so <CODE>/dev/sdb5</CODE> is the
first logical partition on the second SCSI disk.
<P>Each partition entry has a starting and an ending block address
assigned to it and a type. The type is a numerical code (a
byte) which designates a particular partition to a certain type
of operating system. For the benefit of computing consultants
partition type codes are not really unique, so there is always
the probability of two operating systems using the same type
code.
<P>Linux reserves the type code 0x82 for swap partitions and 0x83
for "native" file systems (that's ext2 for almost all of you).
The once popular, now outdated Linux/Minix file system used the
type code 0x81 for partitions. OS/2 marks it's partitions with
a 0x07 type and so does Windows NT's NTFS. MS-DOS allocates
several type codes for its various flavors of FAT file systems:
0x01, 0x04 and 0x06 are known.  DR-DOS used 0x81 to indicate
protected FAT partitions, creating a type clash with Linux/Minix
at that time, but neither Linux/Minix nor DR-DOS are widely
used any more. The extended partition which is used as a
container for logical partitions has a type of 0x05, by the way.
<P>Partitions are created and deleted with the <CODE>fdisk</CODE> program.
Every self respecting operating system program comes with an
<CODE>fdisk</CODE> and traditionally it is even called <CODE>fdisk</CODE> (or <CODE>FDISK.EXE</CODE>)
in almost all OSes. Some <CODE>fdisk</CODE>s, noteable the DOS one, are
somehow limited when they have to deal with other operating
systems partitions. Such limitations include the complete
inability to deal with anything with a foreign type code, the
inability to deal with cylinder numbers above 1024 and the
inability to create or even understand partitions that do not
end on a cylinder boundary. For example, the MS-DOS fdisk can't
delete NTFS partitions, the OS/2 fdisk has been known to
silently "correct" partitions created by the Linux fdisk that
do not end on a cylinder boundary and both, the DOS and the
OS/2 fdisk, have had problems with disks with more than 1024
cylinders (see the "large-disk" Mini-Howto for details on such
disks).
