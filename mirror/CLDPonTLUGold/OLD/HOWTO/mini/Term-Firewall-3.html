<P>The "term" program is normally used over a modem or serial line, to
allow various host-to-host services to flow along this simple serial
connection.  However, sometimes it is useful to establish a term
connection between two machines that communicate via telnet.  The most
interesting instance of this is for connecting two hosts which are
separated by ethernet firewalls or SOCKS servers.  Such firewalls
provides facilities for establishing a telnet connection through the
firewall, typically by using the SOCKS protocol to allow inside
machines to get connections out, and requiring outside users to telnet
first to a gateway machine which requires a one-time password.  These
firewalls make it impossible to, for instance, have X clients on an
inside machine communicate with an X server on an outside machine.
But, by setting up a term connection, these restrictions can all be
bypassed quite conveniently, at the user level.
