<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Before you ask</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This document does not describe how to install Linux on
laptops, but how to optimize a ready-configured Linux for
use on laptops. Please read the <EM>Installation-HOWTO</EM> or your
distributor's handbook for help with installing Linux.
<P>
<P>This document does not describe how to use an uninterruptable
power supply and the <CODE>powerd</CODE> daemon, either (even though
a ups is a big battery). Read the <EM>UPS-HOWTO</EM> for details
about that subject.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What this document is about</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>More and more people own portable computers these days and in
turn, more and more people install Linux on such machines.
<P>
<P>Installing and using Linux on a laptop is usually no problem at
all, so go ahead and give it a try. Unlike some other operating
systems, Linux still supports and runs well on even very old
hardware, so you might give your outdated portable a new
purpose in life by installing Linux on it.
<P>
<P>If you need help with installing Linux on a laptop or if you
have questions about laptop hardware, you can check the
excellent <EM>Linux Laptop webpage</EM> at
<CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/</A></CODE>
where you will find a lot of useful information and detailed
help. The Linux Laptop page describes hardware configuration
for specific laptop models and chipsets.
<P>
<P>This HOWTO however will focus on the one problem that is
common to all portable systems: <EM>Power consumption</EM>.
<P>
<P>Yet, I have not found a Linux distribution that comes with a
configuration <EM>optimized</EM> for laptops. Since I could not find this
kind of information anywhere else, I have started to collect a
few simple but effective tricks that will help you save battery
power and in turn increase your system's uptime while running
on battery.
<P>
<P>(Sidenote. I received a complaint by a reader that these tips were
not very effective with his laptop. So does all this really
work? Yes, but don't expect miracles. I was able to increase my
laptop's battery time from 90 minutes to more than 120
minutes.)

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Roadmap</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If you are a laptop pro, you can probably skip the
<A HREF="Battery-Powered-2.html#GeneralInformation">General Information</A> section. If
you are a Linux pro, what you really want to know can be found in the
<A HREF="Battery-Powered-4.html#Changingsomegeneralsystemsettings">Changing some general system settings</A>
section. If you are a Linux distributor, please read
<A HREF="Battery-Powered-5.html#AmessagetoLinuxdistributors">A message to Linux distributors</A>.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Feedback</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Your feedback is welcome. Please send comments to
<CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:hanno@lava.de">hanno@lava.de</A></CODE>. Did
it work on your system? Do you have new tips? Are there any outdated links
or addresses in this text?
<P>
<P>I am sorry, but I will not be able to help you
with questions about specific laptop models. I don't claim
to be a laptop guru, I just happen to own one laptop myself
and I simply want to share the information I collected. Please
check the Linux Laptop webpage first, probably someone else has
already written a page dedicated to your model. Ask your
manufacturer's technical support. Or go the the laptop newsgroup
<CODE>
<A HREF="news:comp.sys.laptops">comp.sys.laptops</A></CODE>
and ask there.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Disclaimer</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>All methods described here were tested by me and worked fine
on my laptop, unless noted otherwise. However, I cannot
guarantee that any of this won't crash or seriously damage
your system. Life is dangerous, so keep backup copies of
your important files before playing with your Linux
configuration. If things go wrong, I do not take any
responsibility for your data loss. In other words: Don't
sue me. Thank you.
