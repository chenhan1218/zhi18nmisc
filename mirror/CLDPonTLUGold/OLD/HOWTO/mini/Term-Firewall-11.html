<P>The linecheck program has some problems checking telnet connections
sometimes.  This is sometimes because it doesn't check the return code
of the <CODE>read()</CODE> call it makes.  For network connections,
this call to <CODE>read()</CODE> can return <CODE>-1</CODE> with an <CODE>EINTR</CODE>
(interrupted) or <CODE>EAGAIN</CODE> (try again) error code.
Obviously this should be checked for.
<P>There are a number of features that could ease the use of term over
telnet.  These primarily relate to an assumption that influenced the
design of term, namely that the connection is low bandwidth, low
latency, and somewhat noisy.
<P>A telnet connection is in general high bandwidth, high latency, and
error free.  This means that the connection could be better utilized
if (a) the maximum window size was raised, well above the limit
imposed by term's <CODE>N_PACKETS/2=16</CODE>,
(b) there was an option to turn off sending and checking packet checksums,
and (c) larger packets were permitted when appropriate.
<P>Also, to enhance security, it would be nice to have a term option to
log all connections through the socket it monitors to a log file, or
to stderr, or both.  This would allow one to see if one's term
connection is being subverted by nasty hackers on the outside insecure
machine.
