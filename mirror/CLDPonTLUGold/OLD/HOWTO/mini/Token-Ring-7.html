<DT><B>Q:</B><DD><P>Can the token ring driver be compiled as a module?
<DT><B>A:</B><DD><P>Yes, it can be &mdash; and it works rather well.
There is an extra parameter that you can use
when it is compiled as a module.
If you ever need to ``spoof'' software install programs,
such as the redhat boot disks, into configuring your token ring card
as an ethernet device (for NFS/FTP installs, etc),
you can use the ``<CODE>device</CODE>'' parameter to force a device name
other then <CODE>tr0</CODE>.
You will probably have problems if you try this with multiple adapters.
It is mostly there to get around a few incompatabiliites. Ex.:

/sbin/insmod ibmtr device=eth0

<DT><B>Q:</B><DD><P>I keep getting an error code ``0011''.  Whats up?
<DT><B>A:</B><DD><P>Make sure that your connection to the network is good or
that you have a loopback connector on your token ring card.
This message just means that it could not open the ring.
99.99% of the times, it is just not plugged into one.
<P>
<DT><B>C:</B><DD><P>If you have a sound card in your machine, and it sits at IO 0x220,
you may end up with a conflict with your token ring adapter at 0xa20.
If you notice that a supported adapter does not seem to be working
and you have a sound card, please try to either set your token ring
card to 0xa24 or move/remove your sound card.
<P>Also...
<P>Here are some email messages that I have received about Token Ring
and Linux.  In some of the messages, I have removed parts
that were not important to save space.

I d/l'd the patch, applied it, and re-compiled. When booting it said,
"tr0: Can't assign device to adapter" and again for tr1.  Any ideas?

Thanks!

When this is the only message issued,
it means that the PIO request for adapter information
(see <CODE>segment = inb(PIOaddr)</CODE> in <CODE>ibmtr.c</CODE>)
was so out of range that there is no TR card at that IO address.

Subject: Token ring problems.

Thanks for responding. I was starting to thing that I posted incorrectly, 
and I was about to post again. Anyway, the following  clip is part of my
/var/adm/messages file from when I boot up.

May  2 10:03:14 linux kernel: tr0: Unable to assign adapter to device.
May  2 10:03:14 linux kernel: tr1: Unable to assign adapter to device.

The section, tr0: Unable to assign adapter device. is what kinda confuses 
me. The documentation is slim at best so I didn't know what to do with 
the message. I know I didn't assign any token ring information,
and I didn't know where to do it.

The hardware:
            Its a PC clone (Dell OMNIPLEX 560 to be exact)
            The token ring card is a Olicom 16/4 Adapter.

I have DOS token ring drivers and it snaps into the network, so there is 
nothing wrong with the card. I think, I am just missing something really 
small in the config on the Linux side.

Try using one of the cards that are listed at the top of
the HOWTO.

Subject: Found an IBM card...

I found myself an IBM token ring card and I got a little further,
but still not luck. (I did change /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 ifconfig entry
from eth0 to tr0)

Anyway, here is part of the /var/adm/messages file:

Does this tell you anything. It tells me little.

This message means either a memory conflict with the MMIO area
or a TR card which is not compatible with the driver
(at least the signature isn't known).

Subject: Almost there...

The following sample is what I'm getting on my messages file:

May  3 14:50:24 linux kernel: tr0: now opening the board...

   and hope for the best.

May  3 15:11:47 linux kernel: tr0: Arrg. Transmitter busy for more than 50 msec.
   Donald resets adapter, but resetting

The Arrg entry only comes when I telnet, rlogin or ftp to a remote 
machine. Once that happens, the connection hangs big time. I took out all 
the other hardware (which was 1 SCSI card) and tried running the card all 
by itself. Same thing, so it eliminates hardware IRQ's from getting into 
a yelling match. The following are the DIP switches on the card:

1       Up      |
2       Down    |
3       Down    |       According to the manual this sets the 
4       Up      |       base address to CC000 Which is fine for
5       Up      |       my machine.
6       Down    |
7       Down    +       This sets the IRQ to 2. Which is also fine      
8       Down    +
9       Up      X       Primary Lan adapter. Which it is.
10      Up      =       16 KB shared RAM size. This OK? 
11      Down    =
12      Up      #       16 Mbps Data rate.

I was wondering if it is in fact the dip switches, or the way I have 
configured my route table and other network info.

ttfn,
Mike

<DT><B>A:</B><DD><P>The Arrg problem is pretty much taken care of in the 2.0 kernels.
All of the patches have not been ported back to 1.2,
and I doubt that they will be.
If you get excessive Arrg messages, do yourself a favour
and move to Linux 2.0.
