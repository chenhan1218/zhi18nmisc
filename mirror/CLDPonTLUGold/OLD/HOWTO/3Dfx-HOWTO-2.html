<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Basics</A>
</H2>

<P>This section gives a <EM>very</EM> cursory overview of computer 
graphics accelerator technology, in order to help you understand
the concepts used later in the document. You should consult e.g.
a book on OpenGL in order to learn more.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Hardware configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>Graphics accelerators come in different flavors: either
as a separate PCI board that is able to pass through
the video signal of a (possibly 2D or video accelerated)
VGA board, or as a PCI board that does both VGA and
3D graphics (effectively replacing older VGA controllers).
The 3Dfx boards based on the Voodoo Graphics (tm) belong to the
former category. We will get into this again later.
<P> 
If there is no address conflict, any 3D accelerator
board could be present under Linux without interfering,
but in order to access the accelerator, you will need
a driver. A combined 2D/3D accelerator might behave
differently.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 A bit of Voodoo Graphics (tm) architecture</A>
</H2>

<P>Usually, accessing texture memory and frame/depth buffer is a
major bottleneck. For each pixel on the screen, there are
at least one (nearest), four (bi-linear), or eight (tri-linear
mipmapped) read accesses to texture memory, plus a read/write
to the depth buffer, and a read/write to frame buffer memory.
<P>The Voodoo Graphics (tm) architecture separates texture memory from
frame/depth buffer memory by introducing two separate
rendering stages, with two corresponding units (Pixelfx and
Texelfx), each having a separate memory interface to dedicated
memory. This gives an above-average fill rate, paid for
restrictions in memory management (e.g. unused framebuffer
memory can not be used for texture caching).
<P>Moreover, a Voodoo Graphics (tm) could use two TMU's (texture management
or texelfx units), and finally, two Voodoo Graphics (tm) could be
combined with a mechanism
called Scan-Line Interleaving (SLI). SLI essentially
means that each Pixelfx unit effectively provides only
every other scanline, which decreases bandwidth impact
on each Pixelfx' framebuffer memory.
