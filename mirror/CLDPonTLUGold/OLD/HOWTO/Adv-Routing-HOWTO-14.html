<H2><A NAME="s14">14. Cookbook</A></H2>

<P>This section contains 'cookbook' entries which may help you solve problems.
A cookbook is no replacement for understanding however, so try and comprehend
what is going on. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.1">14.1 Running multiple sites with different SLAs</A>
</H2>

<P>You can do this in several ways. Apache has some support for this with a
module, but we'll show how Linux can do this for you, and do so for other
services as well. These commands are stolen from a presentation by Jamal
Hadi that's referenced below.
<P>Let's say we have two customers, with http, ftp and streaming audio, and we
want to sell them a limited amount of bandwidth. We do so on the server itself.
<P>Customer A should have at most 2 megabits, cusomer B has paid for 5
megabits. We separate our customers by creating virtual IP addresses on our
server.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# ip address add 188.177.166.1 dev eth0
# ip address add 188.177.166.2 dev eth0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is up to you to attach the different servers to the right IP address. All
popular daemons have support for this.
<P>We first attach a CBQ qdisc to eth0:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: cbq bandwidth 10Mbit cell 8 avpkt 1000 \
  mpu 64
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We then create classes for our customers:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:0 classid 1:1 cbq bandwidth 10Mbit rate \
  2MBit avpkt 1000 prio 5 bounded isolated allot 1514 weight 1 maxburst 21
# tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:0 classid 1:2 cbq bandwidth 10Mbit rate \
  5Mbit avpkt 1000 prio 5 bounded isolated allot 1514 weight 1 maxburst 21
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then we add filters for our two classes:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
##FIXME: Why this line, what does it do?, what is a divisor?:
##FIXME: A divisor has something to do with a hash table, and the number of
##       buckets - ahu
# tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1:0 protocol ip prio 5 handle 1: u32 divisor 1
# tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1:0 prio 5 u32 match ip src 188.177.166.1
  flowid 1:1
# tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1:0 prio 5 u32 match ip src 188.177.166.2
  flowid 1:2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And we're done.
<P>FIXME: why no token bucket filter? is there a default pfifo_fast fallback
somewhere?

<H2><A NAME="ss14.3">14.3 Ratelimit ICMP to prevent dDoS</A>
</H2>

<P>Recently, distributed denial of service attacks have become a major nuisance
on the internet. By properly filtering and ratelimiting your network, you can
both prevent becoming a casualty or the cause of these attacks.
<P>You should filter your networks so that you do not allow non-local IP source
addressed packets to leave your network. This stops people from anonymously
sending junk to the internet. 
<P>
<P>
<P>Rate limiting goes much as shown earlier. To refresh your memory, our
ASCIIgram again:

<P>We first set up the prerequisite parts:

<P>If you have 100Mbit, or more, interfaces, adjust these numbers. Now you need
to determine how much ICMP traffic you want to allow. You can perform
measurements with tcpdump, by having it write to a file for a while, and
seeing how much ICMP passes your network. Do not forget to raise the
snapshot length!
<P>If measurement is impractical, you might want to choose 5% of your available
bandwidth. Let's set up our class:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>This limits at 100Kbit. Now we need a filter to assign ICMP traffic to this
class:

<H2><A NAME="ss14.4">14.4 Prioritizing interactive traffic</A>
</H2>

<P>If lots of data is coming down your link, or going up for that matter, and
you are trying to do some maintenance via telnet or ssh, this may not go too
well. Other packets are blocking your keystrokes. Wouldn't it be great if
there were a way for your interactive packets to sneak past the bulk
traffic? Linux can do this for you!
<P>As before, we need to handle traffic going both ways. Evidently, this works
best if there are Linux boxes on both ends of your link, although other
UNIX's are able to do this. Consult your local Solaris/BSD guru for this.
<P>The standard pfifo_fast scheduler has 3 different 'bands'. Traffic in band 0
is transmitted first, after which traffic in band 1 and 2 gets considered.
It is vital that our interactive traffic be in band 0!
<P>We blatantly adapt from the (soon to be obsolete) ipchains HOWTO:
<P>There are four seldom-used bits in the IP header, called the Type of Service
(TOS) bits. They effect the way packets are treated; the four bits are
"Minimum Delay", "Maximum Throughput", "Maximum Reliability" and "Minimum
Cost". Only one of these bits is allowed to be set. Rob van Nieuwkerk, the
author of the ipchains TOS-mangling code, puts it as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
Especially the "Minimum Delay" is important for me. I switch it on for
"interactive" packets in my upstream (Linux) router. I'm
behind a 33k6 modem link. Linux prioritizes packets in 3 queues. This
way I get acceptable interactive performance while doing bulk
downloads at the same time. 
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The most common use is to set telnet &amp; ftp control connections to "Minimum
Delay" and FTP data to "Maximum Throughput". This would be
done as follows, on your upstream router:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -p tcp --sport telnet \
  -j TOS --set-tos Minimize-Delay
# iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -p tcp --sport ftp \
  -j TOS --set-tos Minimize-Delay
# iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -p tcp --sport ftp-data \
  -j TOS --set-tos Maximize-Throughput
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now, this only works for data going from your telnet foreign host to your
local computer. The other way around appears to be done for you, ie, telnet,
ssh &amp; friends all set the TOS field on outgoing packets automatically.
<P>Should you have a client that does not do this, you can always do it with
netfilter. On your local box:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# iptables -A OUTPUT -t mangle -p tcp --dport telnet \
  -j TOS --set-tos Minimize-Delay
# iptables -A OUTPUT -t mangle -p tcp --dport ftp \
  -j TOS --set-tos Minimize-Delay
# iptables -A OUTPUT -t mangle -p tcp --dport ftp-data \
  -j TOS --set-tos Maximize-Throughput

</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="SQUID"></A> 
This section was sent in by reader Ram Narula from Internet for Education
(Thailand).
<P>The regular technique in accomplishing this in Linux
is probably with use of ipchains AFTER making sure
that the "outgoing" port 80(web) traffic gets routed through
the server running squid.
<P>There are 3 common methods to make sure "outgoing"
port 80 traffic gets routed to the server running squid
and 4th one is being introduced here.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Making the gateway router do it.</B><DD><P>If you can tell your gateway router to 
match packets that has outgoing destination port
of 80 to be sent to the IP address of squid server.
<P>BUT
<P>This would put additional load on the router and
some commercial routers might not even support this.
<DT><B>Using a Layer 4 switch.</B><DD><P>Layer 4 switches can handle this without any problem.
<P>BUT
<P>The cost for this equipment is usually very high. Typical
layer 4 switch would normally cost more than
a typical router+good linux server.
<DT><B>Using cache server as network's gateway.</B><DD><P>You can force ALL traffic through cache server.
<P>BUT
<P>This is quite risky because Squid does
utilize lots of cpu power which might
result in slower over-all network performance
or the server itself might crash and no one on the
network will be able to access the internet if
that occurs.
<P>
<P>
<DT><B>Linux+NetFilter router.</B><DD><P>By using NetFilter another technique can be implemented
which is using NetFilter for "mark"ing the packets
with destination port 80 and using iproute2 to
route the "mark"ed packets to the Squid server.

First, make all traffic pass through naret by making
sure it is the default gateway except for silom.
Silom's default gateway has to be donmuang (10.0.0.3) or
this would create web traffic loop.
<P>
<P>
<P>(all servers on my network had 10.0.0.1 as the default gateway
which was the former IP address of donmuang router so what I did
was changed the IP address of donmuang to 10.0.0.3 and gave
naret ip address of 10.0.0.1)

Silom

-setup squid and ipchains 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Setup Squid server on silom, make sure it does support
transparent caching/proxying, the default port is usually
3128, so all traffic for port 80 has to be redirected to port
3128 locally. This can be done by using ipchains with the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
silom# ipchains -N allow1
silom# ipchains -A allow1 -p TCP -s 10.0.0.0/19 -d 0/0 80 -j REDIRECT 3128
silom# ipchains -I input -j allow1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P> 
<P>Or, in netfilter lingo:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
silom# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(note: you might have other entries as well)
<P>
<P>For more information on setting Squid server please refer
to Squid faq page on 
<A HREF="http://squid.nlanr.net">http://squid.nlanr.net</A>).
<P>
<P>
<P>Make sure ip forwarding is enabled on this server and the default
gateway for this server is donmuang router (NOT naret).

<P>If donmuang and naret is on the same subnet then
naret should not send out icmp REDIRECT messages.
In this case it is, so icmp REDIRECTs has to be
