     OpenContent License (OPL)
     Version 1.0, July 14, 1998. 

     This document outlines  the  principles underlying the  OpenContent
     (OC)  movement and may    be   redistributed provided it    remains
     unaltered. For legal purposes,  this document is the license  under
     which OpenContent is made available for use.

     The  original   version  of this      document may  be   found   at

     LICENSE

     Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying

     Items other than  copying, distributing, and modifying  the Content
     with  which this license was distributed  (such as using, etc.) are
     outside the scope of this license.

     1.  You  may copy and distribute exact  replicas of the OpenContent
     (OC)  as   you receive it,    in any  medium,   provided  that  you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice  and disclaimer of  warranty; keep  intact all the
     notices  that refer  to this   License and to   the absence  of any
     warranty; and give  any other recipients of the  OC a copy of  this
     License along with the OC.  You may at your option charge a fee for
     the media and/or handling involved in creating a unique copy of the
     OC for use   off-line, you may at  your  option  offer instructional
     support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may at your option
     offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You  may not charge a fee for
     the OC itself.  You may  not charge a fee  for the sole service  of
     providing  access to and/or  use of the  OC via a network (e.g. the
     Internet), whether it be via the world wide web,  FTP, or any other
     method.

     2.  You may modify your  copy or copies of  the  OpenContent or any
     portion   of it,  thus   forming works  based on  the  Content, and
     distribute such modifications or work  under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) You  must cause the  modified content to carry prominent notices
     stating that you  changed it, the exact nature  and content  of the
     changes, and the date of any change.

     b) You must cause any work that you  distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part  contains or is  derived from the  OC or  any part
     thereof, to be  licensed  as a  whole  at no  charge to  all  third
     parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise permitted
     under applicable Fair Use law.

     These requirements  apply  to the   modified  work as  a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and
     can  be reasonably considered   independent  and separate works  in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when  you distribute them as  separate works. But when you
     distribute the same  sections as part of  a  whole which  is a work
     based on the OC, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
     of this License,  whose permissions for  other licensees  extend to
     the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who
     wrote it.   Exceptions  are  made to  this  requirement to  release
     modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance
     with Fair Use law where applicable.

     3. You are not required to accept this License,  since you have not
     signed  it. However,  nothing else  grants you  permission to copy,
     distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if
     you  do not accept this    License.  Therefore, by distributing  or
     translating the OC,  or  by deriving works herefrom,  you  indicate
     your acceptance of this  License to do so,   and all its  terms and
     conditions for copying, distributing or translating the OC.

     NO WARRANTY 

     4.  BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC)  IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE
     IS  NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC,  TO THE  EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE  STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED  TO,
     THE IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OF    MERCHANTABILITY  AND FITNESS  FOR   A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE  RISK OF USE OF  THE OC IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE OC PROVE  FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE  UNACCEPTABLE
     YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      
     5.  IN NO EVENT  UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW  OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT  HOLDER,  OR ANY   OTHER PARTY WHO  MAY
     MIRROR AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE OC  AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
     YOU  FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY  GENERAL,  SPECIAL,  INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF   THE USE OR INABILITY TO  USE
     THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
