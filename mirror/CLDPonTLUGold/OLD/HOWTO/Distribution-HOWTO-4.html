</H2>

<P>This document was originated by Bill Riemers.  Matt Welsh
maintained the second version.  Erik Troan then maintained
the document to release 3.0.
<P>In January 1995, Eric Raymond, while unaware of the existence of
this document, began to develop a similar FAQ in the format
of his now-discontinued "PC-clone UNIX Software Buyer's
Guide", which had covered mainly System V UNIXes and BSD/OS.
<P>In March 1995, Eric approached Erik about cooperating on a merged
version.  In early April 1995, Erik went to work for Red Hat
Software, and (wishing to avoid a conflict of interest) handed the
document to Eric.  Eric merged in a lot of new information and
added several new fields to the distribution entries.
<P>Accordingly, this document has been a sort of serial collaboration.
The editorial `we' generally tags observations by all the
maintainers; `I' is Eric (the current one) speaking.
<P>We are delighted to acknowledge the contributions of all the
Linux users and Internet hackers who have contributed information
and feedback.
