<P>Much of this document was created from various information sources
on the Internet, many found from Yahoo and DEC's Alta Vista Search
engine.  Included in this was the documentation of most of the
software packages mentioned in the text.  Some information was also
gleaned from the Royal National Institute for the Blind's helpsheets.
<P>T.V. Raman, the author of Emacspeak has reliably contributed comments,
information and text as well as putting me in touch with other people
who he knew on the Internet.
<P>Kenneth Albanowski 
<A HREF="mailto:kjahds@kjahds.com">&lt;kjahds@kjahds.com&gt;</A> provided the
patch needed for the Brailloterm and information about it.
<P>Roland Dyroff of 
<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/">S.u.S.E. GmbH</A> 
(Linux distributors and makers of S.u.S.E. Linux (English/German)) looked up
KTS Stolper GmbH at my request and got some hardware details and
information on the Brailloterm.
<P>The most major and careful checks over of this document were done by
James Bowden, 
<A HREF="mailto:jrbowden@bcs.org.uk">&lt;jrbowden@bcs.org.uk&gt;</A> and Nikhil Nair 
<A HREF="mailto:nn201@cus.cam.ac.uk">&lt;nn201@cus.cam.ac.uk&gt;</A>, the
<CODE>BRLTTY</CODE> authors who suggested a large number of corrections
as well as extra information for some topics.
<P>The contributors to the blinux and linux-access mailing lists have
contributed to this document by providng information for me to read.  
<P>Mark E. Novak of the Trace R&amp;D centre 
<A HREF="http://trace.wisc.edu/">http://trace.wisc.edu/</A> pointed me in the direction of several
packages of software and information which I had not seen before.  He
also made some comments on the structure of the document which I have
partially taken into account and should probably do more about.
<P>Other contributors include Nicolas Pitrie and Stephane Doyon.
<P>A number of other people have contributed comments and information.
Specific contributions are acknowledged within the document.
<P>This version was specifically produced for 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</A>'s Dr. Linux book.  This is
because they provided warning of it's impending release to myself and
other LDP authors.  Their doing this is strongly appreciated since
wrong or old information sits around much longer in a book than on the
Internet.
<P>No doubt you made a contribution and I haven't mentioned it.  Don't
worry, it was an accident.  I'm sorry.  Just tell me and I will add
you to the next version.  
<P>
