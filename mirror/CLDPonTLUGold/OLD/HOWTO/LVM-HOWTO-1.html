<P>Welcome, gentle reader.
<P>This document is written to help enlighten you on what LVM is, how it works,
and how you can use it to make your life easier. While there is an LVM
FAQ, and even a German HOWTO, this document is written from a different
perspective. It is a true 'HOWTO' in that it is very hands-on, while also
imparting understanding (hopefully).
<P>I should make it clear that I am not an author of the Linux Logical Volume
Manager. I have great respect for the people who are, and hope to be able to
cooperate with them.
<P>It's even weirder, I don't even know the developers of LVM. I hope this will
change soon. I apologise in advance for stepping on peoples toes.

<P>If your disks melt and your company fires you - it's never our fault. Sorry.
Make frequent backups and do your experiments on non-mission critical
systems.

</H2>

<P>Not much. If you have ever installed Linux and made a filesystem
(fdisk/mkfs), you should be all set.  As always when operating as root,
caution is advised.  Incorrect commands or any operation on device files
may damage your existing data.
<P>If you know how to configure HP/UX LVM you are almost done, Linux works
almost exactly like the HP implementation.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Housekeeping notes</A>
</H2>

<P>There are several things which should be noted about this document. While I
wrote most of it, I really don't want it to stay that way. I am a strong
believer in Open Source, so I encourage you to send feedback, updates,
patches etcetera. Do not hesitate to inform us of typos or plain old errors.
<P>If you feel to you are better qualified to maintain a section, or think that
you can author and maintain new sections, you are welcome to do so. The SGML
of this HOWTO is available via CVS.  I envision this being a collaborative
project.
<P>In aid of this, you will find lots of FIXME notices. Patches are always
welcome! Wherever you find a FIXME, you should know that you are treading
unknown territory. This is not to say that there are no errors elsewhere,
but be extra careful. If you have validated something, please let us know so
I can remove the FIXME notice.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Access, CVS &amp; submitting updates</A>
</H2>

<P>The canonical location for the HOWTO is
<A HREF="http://www.ds9a.nl/lvm-howto/">http://www.ds9a.nl/lvm-howto/</A>.
<P>We now have anonymous CVS access available for the world at large.  This
allows you to easily obtain the latest version of this HOWTO and to
provide your changes and enhancements.
<P>If you want to grab a copy of the HOWTO via CVS, here is how to do so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anon@outpost.ds9a.nl:/var/cvsroot
$ cvs login
CVS password: [enter 'cvs' (without 's)]
$ cvs co lvm-howto
cvs server: Updating lvm-howto
U lvm-howto/lvm-howto.sgml
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you spot an error, or want to add something, just fix it locally, and run
"cvs diff -u", and send the result off to us.
<P>A Makefile is supplied which should help you create postscript, dvi, pdf,
html and plain text. You may need to install sgml-tools, ghostscript and
tetex to get all formats.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Layout of this document</A>
</H2>

<P>We will initially be explaining some basic stuff which is needed to do
things. We do try however to include examples where this would aid
comprehension.
