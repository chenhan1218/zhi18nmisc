<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Introduction to iproute2</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Why iproute2?</A>
</H2>

<P>Most Linux distributions, and most UNIX's, currently use the 
venerable 'arp', 'ifconfig' and 'route' commands. While these tools work,
they show some unexpected behaviour under Linux 2.2 and up. For example, GRE
tunnels are an integral part of routing these days, but require completely
different tools.
<P>With iproute2, tunnels are an integral part of the tool set.
<P>The 2.2 and above Linux kernels include a completely redesigned network
subsystem. This new networking code brings Linux performance and a feature
set with little competition in the general OS arena. In fact, the new
routing, filtering, and classifying code is more featureful then that
provided by many dedicated routers and firewalls and traffic shaping
products.
<P>As new networking concepts have been invented, people have found ways to
plaster them on top of the existing framework in existing OSes. This
constant layering of cruft has lead to networking code that is filled with
strange behaviour, much like most human languages. In the past, Linux
emulated SunOS's handling of many of these things, which was not ideal.  
<P>This new framework makes it possible to clearly express features
previously beyond Linux's reach.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 iproute2 tour</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux has a sophisticated system for bandwidth provisioning called Traffic
Control. This system supports various method for classifying, prioritizing,
sharing, and limiting both inbound and outbound traffic.
<P>
<P>We'll start off with a tiny tour of iproute2 possibilities.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Prerequisites</A>
</H2>

<P>You should make sure that you have the userland tools installed. This
package is called 'iproute' on both RedHat and Debian, and may otherwise be
found at <CODE>ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iproute2-2.2.4-now-ss??????.tar.gz"</CODE>. 
Some parts of iproute require you to have certain kernel options enabled.
<P>You can also try 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iproute2-current.tar.gz">here</A> 
for the latest version.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Exploring your current configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>This may come as a surprise, but iproute2 is already configured! The current
commands <CODE>ifconfig</CODE> and <CODE>route</CODE> are already using the advanced
syscalls, but mostly with very default (ie. boring) settings.
<P>The <CODE>ip</CODE> tool is central, and we'll ask it do display our interfaces
for us.
<H3><CODE>ip</CODE> shows us our links</H3>

<P>Your mileage may vary, but this is what it shows on my NAT router at
home. I'll only explain part of the output as not everything is directly
relevant.
<P>We first see the loopback interface. While your computer may function
somewhat without one, I'd advise against it. The MTU size (Maximum Transfer
Unit) is 3924 octets, and it is not supposed to queue. Which makes sense
because the loopback interface is a figment of your kernel's imagination.
<P>I'll skip the dummy interface for now, and it may not be present on your
computer. Then there are my two physical network interfaces, one at the side of my
cable modem, the other serves my home ethernet segment. Furthermore, we see
a ppp0 interface.
<P>Note the absence of IP addresses. iproute disconnects the concept of 'links'
and 'IP addresses'. With IP aliasing, the concept of 'the' IP address had
become quite irrelevant anyhow. 
<P>It does show us the MAC addresses though, the hardware identifier of our
ethernet interfaces.
<H3><CODE>ip</CODE> shows us our IP addresses</H3>

<P>This contains more information. It shows all our addresses, and to which
cards they belong. 'inet' stands for Internet (IPv4). There are lots of other
address families, but these don't concern us right now.
<P>Let's examine eth0 somewhat closer. It says that it is related to the inet
address '10.0.0.1/8'. What does this mean? The /8 stands for the number of
bits that are in the Network Address. There are 32 bits, so we have 24 bits
left that are part of our network. The first 8 bits of 10.0.0.1 correspond
to 10.0.0.0, our Network Address, and our netmask is 255.0.0.0.
<P>The other bits are connected to this interface, so 10.250.3.13 is directly
available on eth0, as is 10.0.0.1 for example. 
<P>With ppp0, the same concept goes, though the numbers are different. Its
address is 212.64.94.251, without a subnet mask. This means that we have a
point-to-point connection and that every address, with the exception of
212.64.94.251, is remote. There is more information however, it tells us
that on the other side of the link is yet again only one address,
212.64.94.1. The /32 tells us that there are no 'network bits'.
<P>It is absolutely vital that you grasp these concepts. Refer to the
documentation mentioned at the beginning of this HOWTO if you have trouble.
<P>You may also note 'qdisc', which stands for Queueing Discipline. This will
become vital later on. 
<P>
<H3><CODE>ip</CODE> shows us our routes</H3>

<P>Well, we now know how to find 10.x.y.z addresses, and we are able to reach
212.64.94.1. This is not enough however, so we need instructions on how to
reach the world. The internet is available via our ppp connection, and it
appears that 212.64.94.1 is willing to spread our packets around the
world, and deliver results back to us.

<P>This is pretty much self explanatory. The first 4 lines of output explicitly
state what was already implied by <CODE>ip address show</CODE>, the last line
tells us that the rest of the world can be found via 212.64.94.1, our
default gateway. We can see that it is a gateway because of the word
via, which tells us that we need to send packets to 212.64.94.1, and that it
will take care of things.
<P>For reference, this is what the old 'route' utility shows us:

<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 ARP</A>
</H2>

<P>ARP is the Address Resolution Protocol as described in
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc826.html">RFC 826</A>.
ARP is used by a networked machine to resolve the hardware location/address of
another machine on the same
local network.  Machines on the Internet are generally known by their names
which resolve to IP
addresses.  This is how a machine on the foo.com network is able to communicate
with another machine which is on the bar.net network.  An IP address, though,
cannot tell you the physical location of a machine.  This is where ARP comes
into the picture.
<P>Let's take a very simple example.  Suppose I have a network composed of several
machines.  Two of the machines which are currently on my network are foo
with an IP address of 10.0.0.1 and bar with an IP address of 10.0.0.2.
Now foo wants to ping bar to see that he is alive, but alas, foo has no idea
where bar is.  So when foo decides to ping bar he will need to send
out an ARP request.
This ARP request is akin to foo shouting out on the network "Bar (10.0.0.2)!
Where are you?"  As a result of this every machine on the network will hear
foo shouting, but only bar (10.0.0.2) will respond.  Bar will then send an
ARP reply directly back to foo which is akin
bar saying,
"Foo (10.0.0.1) I am here at 00:60:94:E9:08:12."  After this simple transaction
used to locate his friend on the network foo is able to communicate with bar
until he (his arp cache) forgets where bar is.
<P>Now let's see how this works.
You can view your machines current arp/neighbor cache/table like so:

[root@espa041 /home/src/iputils]# ip neigh show
9.3.76.42 dev eth0 lladdr 00:60:08:3f:e9:f9 nud reachable
9.3.76.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:06:29:21:73:c8 nud reachable
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As you can see my machine espa041 (9.3.76.41) knows where to find espa042 
(9.3.76.42) and
espagate (9.3.76.1).  Now let's add another machine to the arp cache.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[root@espa041 /home/paulsch/.gnome-desktop]# ping -c 1 espa043
PING espa043.austin.ibm.com (9.3.76.43) from 9.3.76.41 : 56(84) bytes of data.

--- espa043.austin.ibm.com ping statistics ---

round-trip min/avg/max = 0.9/0.9/0.9 ms

[root@espa041 /home/src/iputils]# ip neigh show
9.3.76.43 dev eth0 lladdr 00:06:29:21:80:20 nud reachable
9.3.76.42 dev eth0 lladdr 00:60:08:3f:e9:f9 nud reachable
9.3.76.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:06:29:21:73:c8 nud reachable
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As a result of espa041 trying to contact espa043, espa043's hardware
address/location has now been added to the arp/nieghbor cache.
So until the entry for
espa043 times out (as a result of no communication between the two) espa041
knows where to find espa043 and has no need to send an ARP request.
<P>Now let's delete espa043 from our arp cache:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[root@espa041 /home/src/iputils]# ip neigh delete 9.3.76.43 dev eth0
[root@espa041 /home/src/iputils]# ip neigh show
9.3.76.43 dev eth0  nud failed
9.3.76.42 dev eth0 lladdr 00:60:08:3f:e9:f9 nud reachable
9.3.76.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:06:29:21:73:c8 nud stale
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now espa041 has again forgotten where to find espa043 and will need to send
another ARP request the next time he needs to communicate with espa043.
You can also see from the above output that espagate (9.3.76.1) has been
changed to the "stale" state.  This means that the location shown is still
valid, but it will have to be confirmed at the first transaction to that
machine.
