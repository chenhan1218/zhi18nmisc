<H2><A NAME="s2">2. SPARC, which one ?</A></H2>

<P>We are only dealing with, SPARC based 
workstations, in order to check, just
type <CODE>uname -m</CODE> command and you should read
something like <CODE>sparc4x</CODE> where x is blank,c,d,m,u
if the system runs Solaris, or <CODE>sparc</CODE> for 32 bits SPARC architectures
and <CODE>sparc64</CODE> for 64 bits SPARC architectures if it runs Linux.
2.2.x
<P>
<P>
<P>SPARC stands for Scalable Processor ARChitecture,
it derives from research done between 1984-1988 
on the  RISC architecture at UC Berkeley.
It exists 3 versions of this archiecture, SPARC-V7, SPARC-V8 
( 32 bits ) and SPARC-V9 ( 64 bits ).
As you are likely to encounter a lot of implementations of
the SPARC architecture, I have summarized the main features
of theses processors.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Sun SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>This is quite obsolete, it is an implementation of the 
SPARC-V7 ; its main feature are an Integer unit ( IU ), an external Floating Point Unit ( FPU ),
an unified data + instruction 64KB direct associative cache, and an Memory Managment Unit ( MMU ).
There is a 4 stage pipeline for the integer instructions 
( fetch F, decode D, exec E, update WB )
FPU and IU are synchronized
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Super SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>This is Texas Instrument and Sun's brainchild, it is usualy found at clok rates around 50Mhz 
featuring up to 1MB L2 cache, it is available both on single and dual processor modules 
( SparcStation 10 and SparcStation 20 ). The higher clock frequency I
have encountered is 60Mhz.
<P>On a technical point of view this is a SPARC-V8 implementation,
it is a superscalar processor,
having 2 caches, one for instruction the other one for data. 
<UL>
<LI>The 20kB instruction cache is a 5 way associative.</LI>
<LI>The 16KB data cache is 4 way associative. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Micro SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>This is once again Texas Instrument and Sun's brainchild, you can find
it in the SparcStation Classic, SparcStation LX, at frequency up to
50Mhz. Its derivative the Micro SPARC II can be found in SparcStation
4, SparcStation 5 at frequencies up to 110Mhz.
<P>On a technical point of view, its main features are a high level of
integration, having 2 caches, one for instructions, the other one for
data.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A 4KB instruction direct associative cache.</LI>
<LI>A 2KB data direct associative cache.</LI>
</UL>
 
<P>It is not possible to had an L2 cache.
If wish to learn more about the MicroSPARC processor you can browse
Sun's 
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/microelectronics/microSPARC/"> Ultra SPARC</A> ressources. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Hyper SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>This processor was introduced by ROSS in 1993, it is usualy found in the 
SparcStation 10, and SparcStation 20, at frequencies up to 150Mhz 
( I have heard of 200Mhz dual processor modules, but Have not
witnessed one yet ). It can be found on single or dual
processor modules.
<P> 
On a technical point of view it is an implementation of the SPARC-V8,
it is superscalar. It can be found with L2 cache up to 512KB
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Ultra SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>The Ultra SPARC processor is an extension of the SPARC-V9
architecture, it is a 64 bits processor, it features some video
processing instructions. It is found in all the workstation whose name
start with Ultra.
<P>The Ultra SPARC II is an improvement of the Ultra SPARC, the 
Ultra SPARCIII is actually the second generation of Ultra SPARC
processors, it was first introduced in the SunBlade 1000 Workstation.
If wish to learn more about the UltraSPARC processors you can browse
Sun's 
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/microelectronics/UltraSPARC/"> Ultra SPARC</A> ressources. 
<P>
<P>
<P>You may read the
<A HREF="http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/CPU-Design-HOWTO.html">CPU-Design-HOWTO</A>, this HOWTO has a lot of interesting links
when it comes to studying the CPUs.
<P>To summarize, the 32 bits workstations are the:
<UL>
<LI>The sun4 workstation is the 
sun4/330 model.</LI>
<LI>The sun4c workstations are the
SparcStation 1,2, IPC and IPX models.</LI>
<LI>The sun4m workstations are the 
SparcStation 5, 10 and 20. </LI>
</UL>

Only the SparcStation 10 and SparcStation 20 are SMP
capable: up to 2 CPU modules.
<P>For more information on the SparcStation 5, 10, 20
you can read Sun's
<A HREF="http://docs.sun.com/ab2/"> documentation </A>online or download it available.
<P>The following model have an 64 bits UltraSPARC
architecture ( sun4u ).
SunUltra 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 80 and SunBlade 1000.
The SunUltra 2, 60, 80 and SunBlade 1000 are SMP capable, 
with the Ultra 80 and SunBlade 1000 accepting up to 4 CPU modules, 
the SunUltra 2 and 60 accepting only 2 CPU modules.
<P>The SunBlade 1000 is the latest one featuring Sun's latest marvel
the Ultra III CPU, at a premium price of course.
You can have a summary of the UltraWorkstation still in production
at 
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/desktop/products/ultrafeatures.html">Sun's</A> website.
<P>A lot of information has been compiled in 
the 
<A HREF="http://www.aceshardware.com/files/sun-hardware-faq.txt">Sun hardware reference</A> that is found on AcesHardware's website, 
or on 
<A HREF="http://www.sunhelp.org/pages.php?page=info-ref">SunHelp</A> 's  website.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Deciphering the CPUs</A>
</H2>

<P>At first, a reference like SM61 or RT-200-D-125/512 seems 
to be, to say the least, quite cryptic.
Actually, understanding theses references is really easy.
<P>
<H3>Ross Technology.</H3>

<P>Theses CPUs's naming scheme is <CODE>RT-a00-b-freq/cache</CODE>
where 
<UL>
<LI><CODE>a</CODE> is a digit:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>1</CODE> SparcStation 10.</LI>
<LI><CODE>2</CODE> SparcStation 20.</LI>
<LI><CODE>6</CODE> SPARC MP600 ( not exactly a workstation ).</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>b</CODE> is a letter:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>D</CODE> Dual CPU.</LI>
<LI><CODE>Q</CODE> Quad CPU.</LI>
<LI><CODE>S</CODE> Single CPU.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>freq</CODE> The frequency expressed in Megahertz.</LI>
<LI><CODE>cache</CODE> The amount of cache memory expressed in Kilobytes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>When theses modules are in a workstations the naming convention is 
HSxy, for example <CODE>ywing</CODE> is a SparcStation 20 HS22,
thus it is easier to have a look inside the workstation.
<H3>SM modules.</H3>

<H3>Cypress.</H3>

<P>Cypress manufactured SPARC compliants processors;
AFAIK their naming scheme is CYnnn. 
<P>As you can see, this is easy to understand.
