<H2><A NAME="s8">8. FAQ: Glide and XFree86?</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Does it run with XFree86?</A>
</H2>

<P>Basically, the Voodoo Graphics (tm) hardware does not care about X. The
X server will not even notice that the video signal generated
by the VGA hardware does not reach the display in single screen
configurations. If your application is not written X aware,
Glide switching to full screen mode might cause problems
(see troubleshooting section). If you do not want the overhead
of writing an X11-aware application, you might want to use
SVGA console mode instead.
<P>So yes, it does run with XFree86, but no, it is not cooperating
if you don't write your application accordingly. You can use
the Mesa "window hack", which will be significantly slower
than fullscreen, but still a lot faster than software rendering
(see section below).
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Does it only run full screen?</A>
</H2>

<P>See above. The Voodoo Graphics (tm) hardware is not window environment
aware, neither is Linux Glide. Again, the experimental
Mesa "window hack" covered below will allow for pasting
the Voodoo Graphics (tm) board framebuffer's content into an X11 window.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 What is the problem with AT3D/Voodoo Rush (tm) boards?</A>
</H2>

<P>There is an inherent problem when using
Voodoo Rush (tm) boards with Linux: Basically, these
boards are meant to be VGA 2D/3D accelerator
boards, either as a single board solution,
or with a Voodoo Rush (tm) based daughterboard used
transparently. The VGA component tied to the
Voodoo Rush (tm) is a Alliance Semiconductor's
ProMotion-AT3D multimedia accelerator.
To use this e.g. with XFree86 at all, you need
a driver for the AT3D chipset.
<P>There is a mailing list on this, and a web site
with FAQ at 
<A HREF="http://www.frozenwave.com/linux-stingray128">www.frozenwave.com/linux-stingray128</A>.
Look there for most current info.
There is a SuSE maintained driver at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.suse.com/suse_update/special/xat3d.tgz">ftp.suse.com/suse_update/special/xat3d.tgz</A>.
Reportedly, the XFree86 SVGA server also
works, supporting 8, 16 and 32 bpp. 
Official support will probably be in XFree86 4.0.
XFree86 decided to prepare an intermediate XFree86 3.3.2
release as well, which might already address the issues.
<P>The
following <CODE>XF86Config</CODE> settings reportedly work.

# device section settings
Chipset "AT24"

# videomodes tested by Oliver Schaertel
#  25.18  28.32  for 640 x 480   (70hz)
#  61.60         for 1024 x 786  (60hz) 
#  120           for 1280 x 1024 (66hz)  
</PRE>

In summary, there is nothing prohibiting this except
for the fact that the drivers in XFree86 are not yet
finished.
<P>If you want a more technical explanation: Voodoo Rush (tm) support 
requires X server changes to support grabbing a buffer
area in the video memory on the AT3D board, as the Voodoo Rush (tm)
based boards need to store their back buffer and z buffer
there. This  memory allocation and locking requirement is not
a 3Dfx specific problem, it is also needed e.g. for 
support of TV capture cards, and is thus under active
development for XFree86. This means changes at the
device dependend X level (thus XAA), which are currently
implemented as an extension to XFree86 DGA (Direct Graphics
Access, an X11 extension proposal implemented in different ways
by Sun and XFree86, that is not part of the final X11R6.1
standard and thus not portable). It might be part of an
XFree86 GLX implementation later on. The currently distributed
X servers assume they have full control of the framebuffer,
and use anything that is not used by the visual region of the
framebuffer as pixmap cache, e.g. for caching fonts.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 What about GLX for XFree86?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a couple of problems.
<P>The currently supported Voodoo Graphics (tm) hardware and the available
revision of Linux Glide are full screen only, and not set up
to share a framebuffer with a window environment. Thus GLX
or other integration with X11 is not yet possible.
<P>The Voodoo Rush (tm) might be capable of cooperating with XFree86
(that is, an SVGA compliant board will work with the
XFree86 SVGA server),
but it is not yet supported by Linux Glide, nor do
S3 or other XFree86 servers support these boards yet.  
<P>In addition, GLX is tied to OpenGL or, in the Linux case, to Mesa.
The XFree86 team is currently working on integrating Mesa with
their X Server. GLX is in beta, XFree86 3.3 has the hooks for GLX.
See Steve Parker's GLX pages at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~sparker/xfree86-3d/">www.cs.utah.edu/~sparker/xfree86-3d/</A>
for the most recent information.
Moreover, there is a joint effort by XFree86 and
SuSe, which includes a GLX, see 
<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/~sim/">www.suse.de/~sim/</A>.
Currently, Mesa still uses its GLX emulation with Linux.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 Glide and commerical X Servers?</A>
</H2>

<P>I have not received any mail regarding use
of Glide and/or Mesa with commercial X Servers.
I would be interested to get confirmation on this,
especially on Mesa and Glide with a commercial
X Server that has GLX support.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Glide and SVGA?</A>
</H2>

<P>You should have no problems running Glide based applications
either single or dual screen using VGA modes. It might be a good
idea to set up the 640x480 resolution in the SVGA modes, too,
if you are using a single screen setup.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7 Glide and GGI?</A>
</H2>

<P>A GGI driver for Glide is under development by Jon
M. Taylor, but has not officially been released and was put
on hold till completion of GGI 0.0.9. For information about
GGI see
<A HREF="http://synergy.caltech.edu/~ggi/">synergy.caltech.edu/~ggi/</A>.
If you are adventurous,
you might find the combination of XGGI (a GGI based
X Server for XFree86) and GGI for Glide an interesting
prospect. There is also a GGI driver interfacing the
OpenGL API; tested with unaccelerated Mesa. Essentially,
this means X11R6 running on a Voodoo Graphics (tm), using
either Mesa or Glide directly.
