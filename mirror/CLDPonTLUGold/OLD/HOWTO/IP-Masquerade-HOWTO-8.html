<P>
</LI>
<LI>Expanded the kernel testing in Section 3 to see if a given kernel already supports MASQ or not.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Reversed the order of the displayed simple MASQ ruleset examples (2.2.x and 2.0.x)</LI>
<LI>Cleaned up some formatting issues in the 2.0.x and 2.2.x rc.firewall files</LI>
<LI>Noted in the 2.2.x rc.firewall that the defrag option is gone in some distro's proc (Debian, TurboLinux, etc)</LI>
<LI>Added a NOTE #3 to the rc.firewall scripts to include instructions for Pump.  Thanks to Ross Johnson for this one.</LI>
<LI>Cleaned up the simple MASQ ruleset examples for both the 2.2.x and 2.2.x kernels</LI>
<LI>Updated the simple and stronger IPCHAINS and IPFWADM rulesets to include the external interface names (IPCHAINS is -i; IPFWADM is -W) to avoid some internal traffic MASQing issues.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Vastly expanded the Section 5 (testing) with even more testing steps with added complete examples of what the output of the testing commands should look like.  
<P>
</LI>

<LI>Reveresed the 2.0.x and 2.2.x sections for PORTFW</LI>
<LI>Updated the news regarding PORTFWing FTP traffic for 2.2.x kernels
<HR>
<PRE>
  NOTE:  At this time, there *IS* a BETA level IP_MASQ_FTP module 
         for PORT Forwarding FTP connections 2.2.x kernels which also supports 
         adding additional PORTFW FTP ports on the fly without the requirement 
         of unloading and reloaded the IP_MASQ_FTP module and thus breaking any 
         existing FTP transfers.
  
</PRE>
<HR>
</LI>
<LI>Added a top level note about PORTFWed FTP support</LI>
<LI>Added a noted to the 2.0.x PORTFW'ed FTP example why users DON'T need to PORTFW port 20.</LI>
<LI>Updated the PORTFW section to also mention that users can use FTP proxy
applications like the one from SuSe to support PORTFWed FTP-like functionality.  Thanks to Stephen Graham for this one.</LI>
<LI>Updated the example for how to enable PORTFWed FTP to also include required configurations to how the ip_masq_ftp module is loaded for users who use multiple PORTs to contact multiple internal FTP servers.  Thanks to Bob Britton for reminding me about this one.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added a FAQ entry for users who have embedded ^Ms in their rc.firewall
file</LI>
<LI>Expanded the FAQ entry talking about how MASQ is different from NAT and Proxy to include some informative URLs.</LI>
<LI>Updated the explination of the MASQ MTU issue and describe the two main explinations of the issue.</LI>
<LI>Clarified that per the RFC, PPPoE should only require an MTU of 1490 though some ISPs require a setting of 1460.  Because of this, I have updated the example to show an MTU of 1490.  </LI>
<LI>Broke out the Windows 9x sections into Win95 and Win98 as they use different settings (DWORD vs. STRING).  I also updated the sections to be more clear and the Registry backup methods have been updated.  </LI>
<LI>Fixed a typo where the NT 4.0 Registry entries were backwards
(Tcpip/Parameters vs. Parameters/Tcpip).  </LI>
<LI>Fixed an issue where the WinNT entry should have been a DWORD and not a
STRING.</LI>
<LI>A serious thanks goes out to Geoff Mottram for his various PPPoE and various Windows Registry entry fixes.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added an explict URL for Oident in the IRC FAQ entry</LI>
<LI>Updated the FAQ section regarding some broken "netstat" versions</LI>
<LI>Added new FAQ sections for MASQ accounting ideas and traffic shaping</LI>
<LI>Expanded the IPROUTE2 FAQ entry on what Policy-routing is.</LI>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Corrected the "intnet" varible in the stronger IPCHAINS ruleset to reflect the 192.168.0.0 network to be consistent with the rest of the example.  Thanks to Ross Johnson for this one.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added a new FAQ section for people asking about forwarding problems between multiple internal MASQed LANs.</LI>
<LI>Added a new FAQ section about users wanting to PORTFW all ports from
multiple external IP addresses to internal ones.  I also touched on peopel
trying to PORTFW all ports on multiple IP ALIASed interfaces and also noted the
Bridge+Firewall HOWTO for DSL and Cablemodem users who have multiple IPs in a
non-routed environment.</LI>
<LI>Added Mandrake 7.1, Mandrake 7.2, and Slackware 7.1 to the supported list</LI>
<LI>Added Redhat 7.0 to the MASQ supported distros.  Thanks to Eugene Goldstein for this one.</LI>
<LI>Fixed a mathmatical error in the "Maximum Throughput" calculation in the FAQ section.  Thanks to Joe White @ ip255@msn.com for this one.</LI>
<LI>Fixed the fact that the Windows9x MTU changes are a STRING change and not a DWORD change to the registry.  Thanks to jmoore@sober.com for this one.</LI>
<LI>Updated the comments in the 2.0.x rc.firewall script to note that the
ip_defrag option is for both 2.0 and 2.2 kernels.  Thanks to pumilia@est.it for
this clarification.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Changes from 1.85 to 1.90 - 07/03/00
<UL>
<LI>Updated the URL for TrinityOS to reflect its new layout</LI>
<LI>Caught a typo in the IPCHAINS rulesets where I was setting "ip_ip_always_defrag" instead of "ip_always_defrag"</LI>
<LI>The URL to Taro Fukunaga was invaild since it was using "mail:" instead of "mailto:"</LI>
<LI>Added some clarification to the "Masqing multiple internal interfaces" where some people didn't understand why eth0 was referenced multiple times.</LI>
<LI>Fixed another "space after the EXTIP variable" bug in the stronger IPCHAINS section.  I guess I missed one.</LI>
<LI>In Test #7 of Section 5, I referred users to go back to step #4.  Thats should have been step #6.</LI>
<LI>Updated the kernel versions that came with SuSe 5.2 and 6.0</LI>
<LI>Fixed a typo (or vs. of) in Section 7.2</LI>
<LI>Added Item #9 to the Testing MASQ section to refer users who are still haing MASQ problems to read the MTU entry in the FAQ</LI>
<LI>Improved the itemization in Section 5</LI>
<LI>Updated the IPCHAINS syntax to show the MASQ/FORWARD table.  Before, it was valid to run "ipchains -F -L" but now only "ipchains -M -L" works.  </LI>
<LI>Updated the LooseUDP documentation to reflect the new LooseUDP behavior in 2.2.16+ kernels.  Before, it was always enabled, now, it defaults to OFF due to a possible MASQed UDP port scanning vunerability.  I have updated the BASIC and SEMI-STRONG IPCHAINS rulesets to reflect this option.</LI>
<LI>Updated the recommended 2.2.x kernel to be 2.2.16+ since there is a TCP root exploit vunerability in all lesser versions.</LI>
<LI>Added Redhat 6.2 to the MASQ supported list</LI>
<LI>Updated the link for Sonny Parlin's FWCONFIG to now point to fBuilder.</LI>
<LI>Updated the various example IP addresses from 111.222.333.444 to be 111.222.121.212 to be within a valid IP address range</LI>
<LI>Updated the URL for the BETA H.323 MASQ module</LI>
<LI>Finally updated the MTU FAQ section to help out PPPoE DSL and Cablemodem users.  Basically, the 
<A HREF="IP-Masquerade-HOWTO-7.html#MTU-issues">MTU-issues</A>
 section now reflects that users can also change the MTU settings of all of their INTERNAL machines to solve the dreaded MASQ MTU issue.  </LI>
<LI>Added a clarification to the PORTFW section that PORTFWed connections that work for EXTERNAL clients will not work for INTERNAL clients.  If you also need INTERNAL portfw, you will need to also impliment the REDIR tool as well.  I also noted that this issue is fixed in the 2.4.x kernels with Netfilter.</LI>
<LI>I also added a technical explination from Juanjo to the end of the PORTFW section to why this senario doesn't work properly.</LI>
<LI>Updated all of the IPCHAINS URLs to point to Paul Rusty's new site at http://netfilter.filewatcher.org/ipchains/</LI>
<LI>Updated Paul Rustys email address</LI>
<LI>Added a new FAQ section for users whose connections remain idle for a long time and their PORTFWed connection no longer work.  </LI>
<LI>Updated all the URLs to the LDP that pointed to metalab.unc.edu to the new site of linuxdoc.org</LI>
<LI>Updated the Netfilter URLs to point to renamed HOWTOs, etc.</LI>
<LI>I also updated the status of the 2.4.x support to note that I *will* add full Netfilter support to this HOWTO and if the time comes, then split that support off into a different HOWTO.</LI>
<LI>Updated the 2.4.x Requirements section to reflect how NetFilter has changed compared to IPFWADM and IPCHAINS and gave a PROs/CONs list of new features and changes to old behaviors.</LI>
<LI>Added a TCP/IP math example to the "My MASQ connection is slow" FAQ entry to better explain what a user should expect performance wise.</LI>
<LI>Updated the HOWTO to reflect that newer versions of the "pump" DHCP client now can run scripts upon bringup, lease renew, etc.</LI>
<LI>Updated the PORTFWing of FTP to reflect that several users say they can successfully forward FTP traffic to internal machines without the need of a special ip_masq_ftp module.  I have made the HOWTO reflect that users should try it without the modified module first and then move to the patch if required.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Changes from 1.82 to 1.85 - 05/29/00
<UL>
<LI>Ambrose Au's name has been taken off the title page as David Ranch has been the primary maintainer for the HOWTO for over a year.  Ambrose will still be involved with the WWW site though.</LI>
<LI>Deleted a stray SPACE in section 6.4</LI>
<LI>Re-ordered the compatible MASQ'ed OS section and added instructions for setting up a AS/400 system running on OS/400.  Thanks to jaco@libero.it for the notes.</LI>
<LI>Added an additional PORFW-FTP patch URL for FTP access if HTTP access fails.</LI>
<LI>Updated the kernel versions for Redhat 5.1 &amp; 6.1 in the FAQ</LI>
<LI>Added FloppyFW to the list of MASQ-enabled Linux distros</LI>
<LI>Fixed an issue in the Stronger IPFWADM rule set where there were spaces between "ppp_ip" and the "=".</LI>
<LI>In the kernel compiling section for 2.2.x kernels, I removed the reference to enable "CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG".  This option was removed from the compiling section and enabled by default with MASQ enabled in 2.2.12.</LI>
<LI>Because of the above change in the kernel behavior, I have added the enabling of ip_always_defrag to all the rc.firewall examples.</LI>
<LI>Updated the status of support for H.323.  There is now ALPHA versions of modules to support H.323 on both 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernels.</LI>
<LI>Added Debian v2.2 to the supported MASQ distributions list</LI>
<LI>Fixed a long standing issue where the section that covered explict filtering of IP addresses for IPCHAINS had old IPFWADM syntax.  I've also cleaned this section up a little and made it a little more understandable.</LI>
<LI>Doh!  Added Juan Ciarlante's URL to the important MASQ resources
section.  Man.. you guys need to make me more honest than this!!</LI>
<LI>Updated the HOWTO to reflect kernels 2.0.38 and 2.2.15</LI>
<LI>Rerversed the order shown to compile kernels to show 2.2.x kernels
first as 2.0.x is getting pretty old.</LI>
<LI>Updated the 2.2.x kernel compiling section to reflect the changed
options for the latter 2.2.x kernels.</LI>
<LI>Added a a possible solution for people that fail to get past MASQ test
#5.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Changes from 1.81 to 1.82 - 01/22/00
<UL>
<LI>Added a missing subsection for /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr in the

<LI>Reorganized and updated the "Masq is slow" FAQ section to include fixing Ethernet speed and duplex issues.</LI>
<LI>Added a link to Donald Becker's MII utilities for Ethernet NIC cards</LI>
<LI>Added a missing ")" for the 2.2.x section (previously fixed it only for the 2.0.x version) to the ICQ portfw script and changed the evaluation from -lt to -le</LI>
<LI>Added Caldera eServer v2.3 to the MASQ supported list</LI>
<LI>Added Mandrake 6.0, 6.1, 7.0 to the MASQ supported list</LI>
