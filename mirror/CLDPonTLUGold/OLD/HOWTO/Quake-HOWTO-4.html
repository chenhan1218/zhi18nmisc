<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 QStat</A>
</H2>

<P>Qstat is a command line based program that returns the status of internet
Quake, QuakeWorld, and Quake 2 servers created by Steve Jankowski 
<A HREF="mailto:steve@activesw.com">mailto:steve@activesw.com</A>.
<P>Here's the feature summary from the QStat homepage:
<UL>
<LI>Supports Windows 95, NT, and most Unixes </LI>
<LI>Comes with C source code and a binary for Windows </LI>
<LI>Supports old Quake (NetQuake), QuakeWorld, Hexen II, and Quake II
servers </LI>
<LI>Can display all available statistics, including player info and
server rules </LI>
<LI>Output templates for automatic HTML generation </LI>
<LI>Raw display mode for integration with HTML page generators </LI>
<LI>Built-in host name cache </LI>
<LI>Sort by ping time, game, or both </LI>
<LI>More options than you can wiggle a mouse at </LI>
</UL>
<P>Qstat is a must-have tool if you're planning on doing any net play.  A 
number of front-ends for qstat have been written as well.  Some of them 
are listed later in this section.
<P>You can get the latest version of qstat from the QStat Homepage (
<A HREF="http://www.activesw.com/people/steve/qstat.html">http://www.activesw.com/people/steve/qstat.html</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 XQF </A>
</H2>

<P>XQF is a graphical front-end to QStat that uses the GTK toolkit.  This is
the best QuakeWorld/Quake2 server browser that currently exists, and 
Roman Pozlevich (
<A HREF="mailto:roma@botik.ru">roma@botik.ru</A>), is still cranking out revisions at the rate of 
about one per month.
<P>If you're familiar with GameSpy for the Windows platform, this is the 
closest thing to it for Linux.
<P>The XQF homepage is at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxgames.com/xqf">http://www.linuxgames.com/xqf</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 QuickSpy</A>
</H2>

<P>QuickSpy is a text-based QuakeWorld server browser.  It's another
front-end to QStat and it works pretty well.  If you don't run X and
you don't have Quake II, this is a decent option.  Beware though, it's no
longer under development. 
<P>
<P>You can get QuickSpy at 
<A HREF="http://diana.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~rht96r/quake/quickspy/">http://diana.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~rht96r/quake/quickspy/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 QPlug for Linux</A>
</H2>

<P>Qplug is a Netscape plugin which retrieves and displays QuakeWorld and
Quake II server information embedded in a web page. A Windows Qplug has
been around for some time.  The author, Olivier Debon (
<A HREF="mailto:odebon@club-internet.fr">odebon@club-internet.fr</A>)
wrote the Linux version from scratch without ever having seen the Windows
version.
<P>QPlug for Linux can be got at 
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/5084/qplug.html">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/5084/qplug.html</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 qkHacklib</A>
</H2>

<P>David Bucciarelli (
<A HREF="mailto:tech.hmw@plus.it">tech.hmw@plus.it</A>), author of the 3Dfx driver for Mesa, has 
written a library called qkHack, which tries to emulate all the 
SVGAlib/fxMesa functions used by Quake and Quake II.  This would remove
the need for SVGAlib when running glquake or Quake II with ref_gl.
Other features from the qkHacklib README:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You can dynamically switch between fullscreen rendering and the in
window rendering just pressing the TAB key (you must start your X server
in 16 bpp mode in order to use this feature)</LI>
<LI>You can press Ctrl-C in the shell or kill the Quake process without
problems</LI>
<LI>you can enable/disable the mouse and keyboard 'grabbing' pressing
F11/F12</LI>
<LI>you can iconify and pause Quake pressing the F10 (it will not
eat more CPU cycles). You can restart everything with a double
click in the "****" icon</LI>
<LI> you can run Quake with any Mesa driver (for example with the
X11 driver but you must recompile the Mesa without the Voodoo
driver)</LI>
<LI>you can run Quake under any Linux box and get the hardware
acclerated output on a SGI box (OK, this is a bit exotic and
theoretical as feature but it is an example of how powerful can be an
GLX/OpenGL application)</LI>
</UL>
<P>I've tried qkHacklib and it works great for Quake on my system.  In 
Quake II, however, the mouse response becomes <EM>really</EM> slow.
Others report complete success, though, so give it a try it it sounds 
like something you need.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 GiMd2Viewer</A>
</H2>

<P>GiMd2Viewer is a Quake 2 model viewer written for Gtk and OpenGL by 
Lionel Ulmer (
<A HREF="mailto:bbrox@mygale.org">bbrox@mygale.org</A>). It loads models and textures from either plain
files or .PAK files.  It will also animate the models (with frame
interpolation). 
<P>This program is still under developement and I haven't tried it yet, but
it sounds pretty nifty.  Check it out at 
<A HREF="http://www.mygale.org/~bbrox/GiMd2Viewer/">http://www.mygale.org/~bbrox/GiMd2Viewer/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 QIPX </A>
</H2>

<P>QIPX is a set of programs that allow Linux Quake clients (using TCP/IP) to
connect with DOS Quake clients (using IPX).  I guess this is useful if
you're playing netquake on a LAN.  QIPX is available at 
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/6083/qipx.html">http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/6083/qipx.html</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 Ice </A>
</H2>

<P>Ice is a Quake map editor for UN*X created by C.J. Beyer and John Watson.
I haven't used this program, nor do I know what its development status is.
The Ice homepage is at

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.9">4.9 Q2getty </A>
</H2>

<P>Q2getty is a hack of mingetty by Mike Gleason (
<A HREF="mailto:mgleason@ncftp.com">mgleason@ncftp.com</A>) that allows you to
automatically run and respawn a program (like a Quake server) on a 
virtual console.
This program is available in the files section at 
<A HREF="http://www.ncftpd.com/unixstuff/q2getty.html">http://www.ncftpd.com/unixstuff/q2getty.html</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.10">4.10 rcon </A>
</H2>

<P>Rcon is a pair of tools that allow remote administration of a Quake II
server using the RCON protocol.  Michael Dwyer (
<A HREF="mailto:mdwyer@holly.colostate.edu">michael_dwyer@mwiworks.com</A>)
is the author.  Rcon 1.1 is available at 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/games/quake/rcon-1.1.tar.gz">http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/games/quake/rcon-1.1.tar.gz</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.11">4.11 qlog ++</A>
</H2>

<P>Qlog is a GPL'ed QuakeWorld/Quake II server log parser that generates
comprehensive player statistics.   Craig Knudsen (
<A HREF="mailto:cknudsen@radix.net">cknudsen@radix.net</A>) is the author.
The qlog homepage is 
<A HREF="http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/qlog/">http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/qlog/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.12">4.12 Cheapo **</A>
</H2>

<P>Cheapo is a proxy that can be used to route QuakeWorld network
traffic. Additionally, the proxy can modify the data and has features
for enhancing gameplay. You can connect to cheapo as if it were a
Quakeworld server, and then give it commands that forward you to a
real server.  The proxy can also be run on a firewall machine
incapable of handling Quake traffic, so that machines inside the
firewall can be used for playing.  
The Cheapo homepage is at 
<A HREF="http://www.saunalahti.fi/~softech/">http://www.saunalahti.fi/~softech/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.13">4.13 qgraph **</A>
</H2>

<P>QGraph (Quake Graph) is a utility to help people in managing Quake's
DeathMathes, turnments and Quakeworld games.
QGraph is a program who connects (via Lan or the Internet) to a Quake,
QuakeII, Quakeworld and Hexen2 Servers and shows you realtime data about
the game running on that server.
