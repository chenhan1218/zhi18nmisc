<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Clients and Application Tips</A></H2>

<P>We have covered a few clients in X, and this section will cover some
more.  We will limit our discussion here to the most basic and important
core items, those which come with X or you are likely to find yourself
using with X. If you have installed an integrated desktop environment
such
as KDE or GNOME, you will have many others to choose from which likely
perform many of the same functions. However, it is important to know
about
and understand many of the fundamental programs in X, because they can
be
very useful for working with your environment and such.  Also X offers
many new options that even your normal console applications can take
advantage of.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Screen Savers for X</A>
</H2>

<P>A common feature of many operating systems is the ability to blank
the screen after a specified amount of time, and optionally display
some sort of nifty graphics demo thing, a screen saver.  There are a
couple ways to do that in X, too.
<P>The most basic way to use this feature is by putting a command in your 
<CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> startup file such as <CODE>xset dpms 2400 3600
4800</CODE>.   The <B>xset</B> program can configure the screen saving
features of  the X server, not to be confused with the screen blanking
that the  kernel does when you are at the text console.  With the
<CODE>dpms</CODE>  option, X can use the power saving features of your
monitor as well.   The first option configures how many seconds before
the screen blanks,  the second option is how many seconds before the
power saving  feature starts, and the third option is for the
&quot;off&quot; mode.  Turning on an option implicitly enables the
feature, setting a feature  to zero explicitly disables it.
<P>Many Linux distributions come with <B>xlock</B> preinstalled, or as an
option.  This is a pretty basic and fairly nice screen saver.  If you
run it with the <CODE>-nolock</CODE> option, you can see some of the modes
that it offers, and if you leave that option off, it will ask you for a
password when you move the mouse or press a key, as a security feature.
Note that this is no real security, for at a Linux console a user could
restart the computer or just drop out of X with a combination of
keystrokes.  The last method can be disabled, however, and if you are
using <B>xdm</B>, it will offer as much security as your login, so it
may be that only rebooting will let someone in.
<P>A newer and better program is <B>xscreensaver</B> by Jamie Zawinski.
This program offers a great many niceties, for instance, it can run its
processes at a nicer priority level, lessening the load to the system
while it's running, and it automatically detects when the screen has
been
powered down by <B>xset</B> and doesn't waste processor time. Also,
all of the graphics routines it calls are modular demos, and you can
add routines without upgrading the whole package, and it can also call
other programs, such as <CODE>xearth</CODE> or <CODE>xdaliclock</CODE>, as
modules.
<P>The latest version of <B>xscreensaver</B> can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/</A>.  Once you get it installed and
ready to go, here are some nice additions you might wish to add to your
<CODE>.Xdefaults</CODE> file:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 !!! some XScreenSaver sample defaults
 ! Time out after 3 minutes, cycle mode after each 2
 xscreensaver.timeout: 3
 xscreensaver.cycle: 2
 ! Run very low priority, and fade between modes
 xscreensaver.nice: 12
 xscreensaver.fadeSeconds: 2

<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Emacs and XEmacs</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are a fan of the text editor <B>EMACS</B>, or just someone
who uses it a lot, you will find your work even easier in X Windows.
If you have not tried XEmacs, you may want to get it for use in X.
There are features in XEmacs that are nice even if you are not in X,
for instance, your text can be colored to match the markup style you
are editing automatically.
You should give the following modification to your
<CODE>.emacs</CODE> file a shot, and read the info pages for more options.
Also look for an option to edit faces in the menus.

<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>appres</B><DD><P>The appres program prints the resources seen by an
application (or sub-hierarchy of an application) with the specified
class and instance names.  It can be used to determine which
resources a particular program will load.  Useful for debugging your
X defaults and such.
<P>
<DT><B>rclock</B><DD><P>Many distributions come with this nice replacement
for xclock, which saves memory, alerts you when your mail comes, and
can pop up reminder messages and launch programs.  The
<B>Battery-Powered
Mini-HOWTO</B> contains instructions on patching this utility to show
how much battery is left in your laptop, too.
<P>
<DT><B>rxvt</B><DD><P>A nice replacement for xterm - uses less memory, works
faster, lets you put in a background pixmap, and lets you switch
fonts with keyboard hotkeys, rather than menus.
<P>
<DT><B>xcpustate</B><DD><P>Displays CPU state (idle, nice, system, kernel)
statistics, as well as Ethernet information.
<P>
<DT><B>xearth</B><DD><P>Display the earth on your root window, many options
for display available. <B>Xscreensaver</B> can use this as a
screensaver module, for maximum fun.
<P>
<DT><B>xfig</B><DD><P>A vector drawing program, particularly useful for
charts and documentation. Quite useful but hard to get the hang of at
first.
<P>
<DT><B>xfontsel</B><DD><P>Font selection utility for X Window.  Try the command
<CODE>xterm -fn `xfontsel -print` &amp;</CODE> to pick a font and then open
the
xterm window using that font.
<P>
<DT><B>xload</B><DD><P>Monitor your memory usage with a moving graph or the
lights on your keyboard! If you use Window Maker, look for
<B>wmmon</B> to do the same, but prettier.
<P>
<DT><B>xmag</B><DD><P>A magnifying glass for X, with a couple other useful
features.
<P>
<DT><B>xman</B><DD><P>Manual page browser for X.  If the little box it starts
with gets annoying, launch it with the <EM>-notopbox</EM> option.
<P>
<DT><B>xmodmap</B><DD><P>Edit and display the keyboard modifier map and
keymap table that are used by client applications to convert event
keycodes into keysyms, usually run from user's startup script. An
example
was given earlier in this document, see the man pages for more info.
<P>
<DT><B>xpaint</B><DD><P>Basic bitmap painting program, for any real work you
should grab 
<A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>xset</B><DD><P>User preference utility for X. You can change all sorts
of stuff with this.  For instance, <CODE>xset s 600</CODE> sets the screen
to blank after ten minutes.
<P>
<DT><B>xsetroot</B><DD><P>Change the color of your desktop.  If you have a
