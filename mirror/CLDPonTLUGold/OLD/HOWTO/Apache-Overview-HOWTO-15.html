<H2><A NAME="s15">15. Java projects</A></H2>

<P>For historical reasons, Java projects can be found both under the 
java.apache.org and jakarta.apache.org umbrellas. The final goal is that over
time all Java projects will move under the Jakarta umbrella.
<P><EM>The goal of the Jakarta Project is to provide commercial-quality
server solutions based on the Java Platform that are developed in an
open and cooperative fashion.</EM>
<P>The Java on Apache community is a very dynamic and active one, as shows
the quantity and quality of its subprojects, which are described now.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 Ant</A>
</H2>

<P>You can think of Ant as the Java equivalent of make. It is a big success
with Java related projects. Developers can write Java instead of shell
commands. This means increased portability and extensibility. Instead of
Makefiles Ant has XML files.
You can learn more about ANT 
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">here</A>.

<H2><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2 ORO and Regexp</A>
</H2>

<P>ORO is a complete package that provides regular experession support for
Java. It includes Perl5 regular expression support, glob expressions, etc.
All under the Apache license. 
You can learn more about ORO 
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html">here</A>. You can find another lightweight regular expression package,
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/">Regexp</A>.
<H2><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3 Slide</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>Slide is a high-level content management framework.
Conceptually, it provides a hierarchical organization of binary
content which can be stored into arbitrary, heterogenous, distributed
data stores. In addition, Slide integrates security, locking and versioning
services.</EM>
<P>If you are familiar with 
<A HREF="http://www.webdav.org">WedDAV</A>,
Slide uses it extensively. In simple words, what Slides provides is an unified,
simple way to access resources and information. These resources can be stored
in a database, the filesystem, etc. and accessed either thru a WebDAV interface
or Slide own API.
<P>You can learn more at the 
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/index.html">Slide home page</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.4">15.4 Struts</A>
</H2>

<P>Struts is an Apache project that tries to bring the Model-View-Controller
(MVC) design paradigm to web development. It builds on 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet">Servlet</A> and 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer Pages</A> technologies. The model part are the
Java server objects, which represent the internal estate of the application.
Enterprise Java Beans are commonly used here. The view part is constructed
via JavaServer Pages (JSP) which are a combination of static HTML/XML and
Java. JSPs also allow the developer to define its own tags.
The controller part are servlets, which take requests (GET/POST) from the
client, perform actions on the model and update the view by providing the 
appropriate JSP.
You can learn more at the 
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/index.html">Struts project pages</A>.
<H2><A NAME="ss15.5">15.5 Taglibs</A>
</H2>

<P>The JavaServer pages technology allows developers to provide functionality
by adding custom tags. The Taglibs project intends to be a common repository
for these extensions. It includes tags for common utilities (for, date),
SQL database access, etc.
<P>You can learn about TagLibs
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/index.html">here</A>.
More documentation is included in the package.
<H2><A NAME="tomcat"></A> <A NAME="ss15.6">15.6 Tomcat</A>
</H2>

It is the official reference implementation for the Java
Servlet 2.2 and JavaServer Pages 1.1 technologies.
<P>You can learn more in the 
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html">Tomcat homepage</A>. The Tomcat project
was started with a code donation from Sun Microsystems.
<P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.7">15.7 Velocity</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>Velocity is a Java based template engine. It can be used as a
stand-alone utility for generating source code, HTML, reports, or
it can be combined with other systems to provide template services.</EM>
Velocity has a Model View Controller paradigm that enforces separation of
Java code and the HTML template.
<P>You can learn more about Velocity 
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/index.html">here</A>. Velocity is part of
other projects like 
<A HREF="#turbine">Turbine</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.8">15.8 Watchdog</A>
</H2>

JavaServer Pages specifications. You can find more information 
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/watchdog/index.html">here</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="jserv"></A> <A NAME="ss15.9">15.9 JServ</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>Apache JServ is a 100% pure Java servlet engine fully compliant with the
JavaSoft java Servlet APIs 2,0 specification.(...)The result is a pure servlet
engine that works on any "version 1.1" Java Virtual Machine.</EM>
<P>JServ is one of the original Java Apache projects. 
<A HREF="#tomcat">Tomcat</A> will be the successor of JServ once it is finished. 
You can learn more at the 
<A HREF="http://java.apache.org/jserv/index.html">JServ home page</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.10">15.10 JSSI</A>
</H2>

<P>JSSI is an implementation of server side included in the Java language.
Server side includes are tags includes in files that get processed before
the page is served to the client (for example to include the current date)
You can find more information 
<A HREF="http://java.apache.org/jservssi/index.html">here</A>.
<H2><A NAME="ss15.11">15.11 Apache JMeter</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>The Apache JMeter is a 100% pure Java desktop application designed to
load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally
designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test
functions.</EM>
<P>It can be used to test static and dynamic resources and get
inmediate visual feedback.
<P>You can see some screenshots and learn more 
<A HREF="http://java.apache.org/jmeter/index.html">here</A>.
<H2><A NAME="ss15.12">15.12 Server Pages Foundation Classes</A>
</H2>

<P>Is a set of libraries to help solve common problems in server side
application development. They focus on two of them: 
<UL>
<LI><B>Mixing HTML and Java</B>: Provides a library of classes that takes
care of the HTML generation and that can be integrated with the rest of the
Java code.</LI>
<LI><B>HTTP is a stateless protocol</B>: SPFC provides session support,
so applications can keep track of users as they navigate the website. The
application developer does not need to worry about the specific details of
page generation. He can think in more general traditional application terms.
You can learn more about SPFC

<H2><A NAME="ss15.13">15.13 Element Construction Set</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>Element Construction Set (ECS) is a JAVA API or generating elements for
various markup languages it directly supports HTML 4.0 and XML, but can
easily be extended to create tags for any markup language.</EM>
<P>It allows the generation of mark up tags using Java function calls, 
leading to a much cleaner solution that mixing HTML and Java code.

for a common repository of code, it goes one step further: <EM>is an effort to
create, design, develop and maintain a common framework for server
applications written using the Java language.</EM> It provides the means so 
server side Java projects can be easily integrated and build on each other.
