<P> Multiport boards allow many terminals (or modems) to be connected
to one PC computer.  A terminal may be connected to its host computer
either by a direct cable connection, via a modem, or via a terminal
server.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 Multiport I/O Cards (Adapters)</A>
</H2>

<P> Additional serial cards may be purchased which have many serial
ports on them called "multiport boards".  These boards are not covered
in this HOWTO but there is a list of them (with URLs) in the
Serial-HOWTO.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Direct Cable Connection.</A>
</H2>

<P> The simplest way to connect a terminal to a host computer is via a
direct connection to a serial port on the computer.  You may also use
some the info in this section for connecting one computer to another
(via the serial port).  Most PC's come with a couple of serial ports,
but one is usually used by a mouse.  For the EIA-232 port, you need a
null modem cable that crosses over the transmit and receive wires.  In
ethernet terminology it would be called a "crossover cable" (but the
ethernet cable will not work for the serial port).  If you want
hardware flow control, you will probably use the DTR pin (or both the
DTR and DSR pins).
<P>Make sure you have the right kind of cable.  A null modem cable
bought at a computer store may do it (if it's long enough), but it
probably will not work for hardware flow control.  Such a cable may be
labeled as a serial printer cable.   Only larger computer stores are
likely to stock such cables.  A "modem cable" will not work since the
wires go straight thru (and don't cross over).  See 
<A HREF="#buy_or_make_cable">Buy or Make</A> your own cable.  Make sure
you are connecting to your PC's serial port at the male DB25 or the
DB9, and not to your parallel port (female DB25).
<P>
<H3>Null Modem cable pin-out (3, 4, or 5 conductor)</H3>

<P> These 3 diagrams are for real text-terminals.  But you could use
them to connect up 2 PCs if you substitute RTS for DTR and CTS for
DSR.  (Don't use 4-conductors for PC-to-PC).  For terminals, if you
only have DTR flow control (one-way) you may eliminate the RTS-to-DSR
wire.  If you have no hardware flow control, then you may also
eliminate the CTS-to-DTR wire.  Then if you have 2@ twisted pairs, you
may then use 2 wires for signal ground per 
<A HREF="#twist_pair_kludge">A Kludge using Twisted-Pair Cable</A>.  For a DB25 connector on
your PC, you need:

<P>The above don't have modem control lines so be sure to give a "local"

need hardware flow control it must be enabled at your computer (use a

One that you purchase may be wired this way.  Another pinout is for 20

will not provide hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) for directly
connected computers.   Both of the above will work for terminals using
software (Xon/Xoff) flow control (or no flow control).  None of these
cables will work for terminal hardware flow control since most real
terminals support DTR or DTR/DSR flow control (handshaking) but Linux
doesn't yet (2000).

<P>Using the above 2 connections provide full modem control signals and
seemingly allow one to set "stty -clocal".  Then one must turn on the
terminal first (asserts DTR) before the port may be opened in a normal
manner by getty, etc.  But there is likely to be trouble if you fail
to turn on the terminal first (see 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-18.html#rapid_respawn">Getty Respawning Too Rapidly</A>).  For this reason one should use "stty
clocal" which is the default (ignores modem control lines) and the
additional wires in these cables then serve no useful purpose.
<P>In olden days when it may not have been this easy to ignore modem
control signals etc, the following "trick" was done for cables that
lacked conductors for modem control: on your computer side
of the connector, connect RTS and CTS together, and also connect DSR,
DCD and DTR together.  This way, when the computer needs a certain
handshaking signal to proceed, it will get it (falsely) from itself.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="length_"></A> Overcoming length limitations </H3>

<P> A cable longer than a 50 feet or so may not work properly at high
speed.  Much longer lengths sometimes work OK, especially if the speed
is low and/or the cable is a special low-capacitance type and/or the
electronics of the receiving end are extra sensitive.  It is claimed
that under ideal conditions at 9600 baud, 1000 feet works OK.  One way
to cover long distances is to install 2@ line drivers near each serial
port so as to convert unbalanced to balanced (and conversely) and then
use twisted pair cabling.  But line drivers are expensive.
<P>Another way to increase the distance is to try to cancel out much of
the magnetic field created by the currents in the transmit and receive
data wires: TxD and RxD.  To do this, ground return lines,  which have
current which is roughly equal (but in the opposite direction) are
placed next to the the transmit and received wires.  Twisted pair has
the best cancellation.  Some DEC terminals have two signal ground
wires for this purpose.  For example, one pair would be TxD and
SG(TxD) where SG is signal ground.  If you use ribbon cable, insure
that the TxD and SG(TxD) wires are right next to each other.
Similarly for the RxD.
<P>If there is only one signal ground wire provided by both the PC and
the terminal, it may be split into two wires in a twisted pair cable
for this purpose.  You might think that return currents will be
equally split between the two signal ground wires.  This would cancel
out only about half of the magnetic field.  But it's better
cancellation than this because return current prefers the path of
least impedance.  The return path of a data signal (such as TxD) has
the lowest impedance (due to lower inductance) if it flows back in the
same twisted pair.  Although I've haven't seen any experimental test
results for this method, it should allow longer cable lengths.
<P>
<H3>Hardware Flow Control cables</H3>

<P> If you expect to use hardware flow control (handshaking) you will
likely need to make up your own cable (or order one made).  Of course,
if the connecters on the ends of a used cable remove, you might rewire
it.  See 
<A HREF="#db_conn_install">Installing DB Connectors</A>.
You will need to determine whether or not the terminal uses the
DTR pin for this, and if not, what pin (or pins) it uses.  The set-up
menus may give you a clue on this since there may be an option for
enabling "DTR handshaking" (or flow control) which of course implies
that it uses the DTR pin.  It may also use the DSR pin.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-10.html#hdw_flow_control">Hardware Flow Control</A> for a detailed
explanation of it.  Older terminals may have no provision for hardware
flow control.
<P>
<H3>Cable tips</H3>

<P> The normal "straight thru" cable will not work unless you are
using it as an extension cable in conjunction with either a null modem
(crossover) cable or a null modem adapter.  Make sure that the
connectors on the cable ends will mate with the connectors on the
hardware.  One may use telephone cable which is at least 4-conductor
(and possibly twisted pair).  Shielded, special low-capacitance cable
computer cable is best.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="twist_pair_kludge"></A> A kludge using twisted-pair cable </H3>

<P> See also 
<A HREF="#length_">Overcoming Length Limitations</A>.
Although none of the EIA-232 signals are balanced for twisted pair
one may attempt to use twisted-pair cable with it.  Use one pair for
transmit and another for receive.  To do this connect signal ground to
one wire in each of these 2 pair.  Only part of the signal ground
current flows in the desired wire but it may help.  Due to the lower
inductance of the twisted pair circuit (as compared to ground return
current by some other path)  more return (ground) current will confine
itself to the desired twisted pair than one would expect from only
resistance calculations.  This is especially true at higher
frequencies since inductive impedance increases with frequency.  The
rectangular wave of the serial port contains high frequency harmonics.
<P>
<H3>Cable grounding</H3>

<P> Pin 1 (of a DB25) should be chassis ground (also earth ground) but
on cheap serial ports it may not even be connected to anything.  A
9-pin connector doesn't even have a chassis ground.  The signal ground
is pin 7 and is usually grounded to chassis ground.  This means that
part of the signal current will flow thru the ground wires of the
building wiring (undesirable).  Cable shields are supposed to be only
grounded at one end of the cable, but it may be better to ground both
ends since it's better to have current in the shield than in the
building wiring ??
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.3">11.3 Modem Connection</A>
</H2>

<P> Using a terminal-modem combination (without a computer) one may
connect to BBS's.  Some BBS's (such a free-nets) permit Internet
access via the text browser lynx which will work on text terminals.
Thus with an old terminal and external modem, one may connect to the
Internet.  If one connects to a host computer on which one has an
account, then one may sometimes store ones work (or downloads) there.
<P>
<H3>Dialing out from a terminal</H3>

<P> Instead of connecting a terminal (or computer emulating a
terminal) directly to a host computer using a cable it may be
connected to the host via a telephone line (or dedicated private line)
with a modem at each end of the line.  The terminal (or computer) will
usually dial out on a phone line to a host computer. 
<P>Most people use a PC and modem for dialing out.  The PC could have a
terminal connected to a serial port and the person at the terminal
may dial out using the PC.   Connecting a real terminal directly to an
external modem is more difficult since the real terminal isn't very
intelligent and doesn't give as much feedback to the user.  For
dialing out, many terminals can store one or more telephone numbers as
messages which may be "set-up" into them and are sent out to the modem
by pressing certain function keys.  Many modems can also store phone
numbers.  The modem initiation sequence must precede the telephone
number.  When the outgoing call is answered by another modem at the
other end of the phone line, the the host computer on this modem may
run a getty program to enable you to log in. 
<P>
<H3>Terminal gets dialed into </H3>

<P> It's common for a computer running Linux to get dialed into.  The
caller gets a login prompt and logs in.  At first glance, it may seem
strange how a dumb terminal (not connected to any computer) could
accept an incoming call, but it can.  One possible reason for doing
this is to save on phone bills where rates are not symmetric.  Your
terminal needs to be set up for dial-in: Set the modem at your
terminal for automatic answer (Register S0 set to 2 will answer on the
2nd ring).  You turn on the terminal and modem before you expect a
call and when the call comes in you get a login prompt and log in.
<P>The host computer that dials out to your terminal needs to do
something quite unusual.  As soon as your modem answers, it needs to
run login (getty).   A host may do this by running the Linux program
"callback" sometimes named "cb".  Callback is for having computer A
call computer B, and then B hangs up and calls A back.  This is what
you want if you are using computer A to emulate a terminal.  For the
case of a real terminal this may be too complex a task so the host may
utilize only the "back" part of the callback program.  The setup file
for callback must be properly configured at the host.  Callback makes
the call to the terminal and then has mgetty run a login on that port.
Mgetty by itself (as of early 1998) is only for dial-in calls but
there is work being done to incorporate callback features into it and
thus make it able to dial-out.  As of early 1999 it didn't seem to have
been done.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4 Terminal Server Connection</A>
</H2>

<P> Terminal servers originally served only text-terminals but many
modern terminal servers function much differently than the ones used
for text-terminals.  They serve PCs over a network and don't deal with
text-terminals at all.  If a modern terminal server is a PC, one
could of course connect text-terminals to it's serial ports but it
wouldn't be a part of the server function of providing services over a
network.  The discussion which follows is about the old-fashioned
terminal servers that deal with text-terminals (or modems).
<P>One use for such terminal servers is to connect many terminals (or
modems) to a high speed network which connects to host computers.  Of
course the terminal server must have the computing power and software
to run network protocols so it is in some ways like a computer.  The
terminal server may interact with the user and ask what computer to
connect to, etc. or it may connect without asking.  One may sometimes
send jobs to a printer thru a terminal server.
<P>A PC today has enough computing power to act like a terminal server
for text terminals except that each serial port should have its own
hardware interrupt.  PC's only have a few spare interrupts for this
purpose and since they are hard-wired you can't create more by
software.  A solution is to use an advanced multiport serial card
which has its own system of interrupts (or on lower cost models,
shares one of the PC's interrupts between a number of ports).  See
Serial-HOWTO for more info about such cards.  If such a PC runs Linux
with getty running on many serial ports it might be thought of as a
terminal server.  It is in effect a terminal server if it is linked to
other PC's over a network and if its job is mainly to pass thru data
and handle the serial port interrupts every 14 (or so) bytes.
Software called "radius" is sometimes used.
<P>Terminal servers evolved to serve more than just terminals.  They also
serve PC's which emulate text-terminals, and were sometimes connected
to a bank of modems connected to phone lines.  On the other end of the
phone line would be modems connected to text-terminals or PCs.  The
PCs might be connected to the Internet this way.  With the advent of
56k digital modems that require a digital connection to service an
incoming phone call, a digital interface to the telephone company was
needed by the server.
<P>This (and more) is provided today by "remote access servers" which
have replaced the old-style terminal server.  Instead of many
individual telephone line cables connected to a terminal server, one
now finds just a few cables with many digitized telephone calls on
each cable (multiplexed).  The multitude of connectors needed for
large numbers of terminals or modems is no longer present on a remote
access server and thus the successor to such a terminal server can't
readily serve text-terminals anymore.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 Connector and Adapter Types</A>
</H2>

<P> A connector is more-or-less permanently attached to the end of a
cable or to a hardware unit.  There are two basic types of connectors
used in serial communications: 1. DBxx with pins (such as DB25) and 2.
modular telephone-style connectors. 
<P>An adapter looks about like a connector but it has two ends.  It is
just like a cable that is so short that there is no cable part left at
all --just different connectors on each end is all that remains.  The
adapter just plugs in on each side.  It allows two incompatible
connectors to mate with each other by going in between them.
Sometimes the purpose of the adapter is to interchange wires.
Obviously, one may use a special cable (perhaps homemade) as a
substitute for an adapter.  
<P>
<H3>Sex of connector/adapters</H3>

<P> Connectors (or one side of adapters) are either male or female.
The connectors that have pins are male and the ones that have sockets
(sometimes also called pins) are female.  For modular connectors, the
ones with exposed contacts are plugs while the ones with internal
contacts (not easy to see) are jacks.  Plugs are male; jacks are
female.  
<P>
<H3>Types of adapters</H3>

<P> There are three basic types of adapters: null modem, gender
changers and port adapters.  Some adapters perform more than one of
these three functions.
<UL>
<LI> null modem adapter: Reroutes wires.  Like a null modem cable.</LI>
<LI> gender changer: Changes the sex of a cable end.  Two connectors
of the same sex can now connect (mate) with each other.</LI>
<LI> port adapter: Goes from one type of connector to another (DB9
to DB 25, etc.)</LI>
</UL>
 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="db_conn"></A> DB connectors </H3>

<P> (For how to install a DB connector on the ends of a cable see 
<A HREF="#db_conn_install">Installing DB Connectors</A>.)  These come in
9 or 25 pins.  The EIA-232 specs. call for 25 pins but since most of
these pins are not used on ordinary serial ports, 9 pins is
sufficient. See 
<A HREF="#DB_pin-out">DB9-DB25</A> for the pin-out.
The pins are usually numbered if you look closely enough or use a
magnifying glass.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="rj_conn"></A> RJ modular connectors </H3>

<P> These look like modern telephone connectors but are sometimes not
compatible with telephone connectors.  See also 
<A HREF="#rj_conn_install">Installing RJ Connectors</A>.  They may be 6,
8, or 10 conductor.  
<P>
<H3>6-conductors: RJ11/14 and MMJ </H3>

<P> RJ11/14 is a 4-6 conductor telephone plug.  A look-alike is a MMJ
connector (6-conductor) used on later model VT (and other) terminals.
It's sometimes referred to as a DEC-423.  MMJ has an offset tab and is
not compatible with RJ11/14 (unless the tab is cut off).  However,
some connectors have been made that are compatible with both MMJ or
RJ11/14.  Since MMJ connectors are both hard to find and expensive
some people have forced a RJ11/14 (6 conductor) to fit MMJ by filing
off a tab with a file.  The MMJ pin-out is: 1-DTR, 2-TXD, 3-TXD GND,
4-RXD GND, 5-RXD, 6-DSR.
<P>A standard MMJ null-modem cable has a MMJ connector at each end.  It
connects to the PC using a MMJ-to-DB adapter.  This adapter plugs into
a DB (say 25 pin) connector on the back of the PC and the MMJ
connecter plugs into it.  If you don't have such an adapter, you can
make a custom cable with a MMJ (or filed RJ) connector on one end and
a DB connector on the other end.  
<P>The standard null-modem cable with two MMJ (or RJ11/14) connectors
will connect: 1-6, 2-5, and 3-4.  Note that such a cable supports
DTR/DSR flow control which is not supported (yet) by Linux.  Making up
your own standard 6-conductor null-modem cable is very simple if you
understand that the ordinary 4-conductor telephone cable from the wall
to your telephone, used in hundreds of millions of homes, is also a
null-modem cable.  Find one and wire your cable the same way.  
<P>If you lay such a cable (or your terminal null-modem cable) flat on
the floor (with no twists) you will note that both plugs on the ends
have their gold contacts facing up (or both facing down).  Although
it's symmetrical, it is also null- modem if you think about it a bit.
One may put a few such cables together with inline couplers and
everything works OK because each inline coupler is also a null-modem
adapter.  Two null-modem devices in series result in a straight-thru

<H3>8-conductors and 10-conductors</H3>

<P> RJ45 and RJ48 are usually 8-conductor modular telephone plugs.
However some are 10-conductor and are allegedly wider and will not
mate with 8-conductor ones.  They are used for both flat telephone
cable and round twisted pair cable.  The cable end of the connector
may be different for round and flat cable and both RJ45 and RJ48 may
be 8 or 10 conductor so make sure you get the right one.  RJ48 has an
extra tab so that a RJ48 plug will not push into a RJ45 jack (but a
RJ45 plug will mate with a RJ48 jack).  They're used on some multiport
serial cards and networks.  Heres the pin numbers for an 8-conductor:

<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6 Making or Modifying a Cable</A>
</H2>

<H3><A NAME="buy_or_make_cable"></A> Buy or make ? </H3>

<P> You may try to buy a short, null modem cable.  Just a "modem
cable" will not work.  Null modem cables are often labeled as serial
printer cables (but serial printers are not very popular today and
neither are the cables).  Unfortunately, they will probably not work
for hardware flow control (until Linux supports DTR flow control,
possibly in 2001).  Make sure the connectors on the cable ends will
fit the connectors on your computer and terminal.  
<P>But if you need longer cables to connect up terminals or need hardware
flow control, how do you get the right cables?  The right ready-made
cables may be difficult to find (you might find them by searching the
Internet), especially if you want to use a minimum (say 4) of
conductors.  One option is to get them custom made, which is likely to
be fairly expensive although you might find someone to make them at
prices not too much higher than ready-made cable (I did).  
<P>A low-cost alternative is to buy used cables (if you can find them).
If you get a used terminal, ask if they have a cable for it.  Another
alternative is to make your own.  Even if you get used cables, they
may need some changes to the pin wiring.  In either case, this may
require special tools.  Most connectors that come with short cables
are permanently molded to the cable and can't be rewired but most
custom-made and homemade cables have connectors that can be rewired.
One advantage of making your own cable is that the skills you learn
will come in handy if a cable breaks (or goes bad) or if you need to
make up another cable in a hurry.
<P>
<H3>Pin numbers</H3>

<P> The numbers of the pins should be engraved in the plastic of the
connector.  Each pin should have a number next to it.  You may need a
magnifying glass to read them.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="db_conn_install"></A> Installing DB connectors on cable ends </H3>

<P> See 
<A HREF="#db_conn">DB Connectors</A> for a brief description
of them.  Unfortunately, most cables one purchases today have molded
connectors on each end and can't be modified.  Others have connectors
which unscrew and can be rewired.  If you are making up cable or
modifying an existing one then you need to know about pins.  There are
two types: soldered and crimped.
<P>The crimped pins require a special crimping tool and also need an
"insertion/extraction" tool.  But once you have these tools, making up
and modifying cable may be faster than soldering.  If you are
connecting two wires to one pin (also needed if you want to jumper one
connected pin to another pin) then soldering is faster (for these
pins).  This is because the crimped pins can only take one wire each
while the soldered ones can accept more than one wire per pin.
<P>To insert crimped pins just push them in by hand or with the insertion
tool.  Using the tool for either insertion of removal first requires
putting the tool tip around the wire.  The tool tip should completely
encircle the wire at the the back of the pin.  
<P>Removing a pin with this tool is a little tricky.  These directions
can be best understood if you have both the tool and wires in front of
you as you read this.  With the tool tip around the wire insert the
tool as far as it will go into the hole (about 1 1/2 cm.  Some tools
have a mark (such as a tiny hole) on them to indicate how far to
insert it.  The tool tip should have a tapered gap so that you may get
the tip around the wire by starting it in where the gap is wider than
the wire.  The tool may have 2 tips.  The one that is the most
difficult to get around the wire is also the one that removes the wire
the easiest since it almost completely envelops the wire.
<P>With the tip properly inserted pull on both the tool and the wire
with a gentle pull.  If it doesn't come out, the tool was likely not
inserted correctly so either push it in more or twist it to a
different position (or both).   Perhaps you should have used another
tip that fits tighter around the pin.  Using this tool, one may
readily convert a straight-thru cable to a null-modem cable, etc.
<P>There can be problems using the "insertion/extraction" tool.  If the
tools will not insert on the back of the pin, it could be that the pin
was not neatly crimped to the wire and is sort of square where it
should be round, etc.  If a pin starts to come out but will not pull
out all the way, the pin may be bent.  Look at it under a magnifying
glass.  Straightening a pin with needle-nose pliers may damage the
gold plating but you may have to straighten it to remove it.
Sometimes a stuck pin may be pushed out with a thick screwdriver blade
tip (or the like) but if you push too hard you may gouge the plastic
hole or bend the pin:.
<P>Don't try soldering unless you know what you're doing or have read
about how to do it.

<H3><A NAME="rj_conn_install"></A> Installing RJ connectors </H3>

<P> These are telephone modular connecters one type of which is used
for most ordinary telephones.  But there are many different types (see
<A HREF="#rj_conn">RJ Modular Connectors</A>).
<P>These are not easy to reuse.  You might be able to pull the wires out,
push in something wedged that would lift up the gold-colored contacts
and reuse the connector.  There are special crimping tools used to
install them; a different tool for each type.  
<P>If you don't have a crimping tool, installation is still possible (but
difficult) using a small screwdriver (and possibly a hammer).  Push in
the cable wires and then push each gold-colored contact down hard with
a small screwdriver that will just fit between the insulating ridges
between the contacts.  You may damage it if you fail to use a
screwdriver with a head almost the same thickness as the contacts or
if the screwdriver slips off the contact as you are pushing it down.
You may also use a small hammer to pound on the screwdriver (push
first by hand).
<P>Be sure to not hurt the "remove lever" on the connecter when you push
in the contacts.  Don't just set it down on a table and push in the
contacts.  Instead, put a shim (about 1 mm thick) that fits snugly
in the crevice between the lever and the body.  For such a shim you
may use thick cardboard, several calling cards, or wood.  Since the
bottom of the connector (that you will put on the table) isn't level
(due to the "remove lever), make sure that the table top has something
a little soft on it (like a sheet of cardboard) to help support the
non-level connector.  Even better would be to put another 1mm shim
under the first 6mm of the connector, supporting it just under where
you see the contacts.  A soft tabletop wouldn't hurt either.  Another
method (I've never done this) is to hold the connector in a vice but
be careful not to break the connector.
<P>As compared to using a crimping tool, installing it per above takes a
lot longer and is much more prone to errors and failure but it's sometimes
more expedient and a lot cheaper than buying a special tool if you
only have one or two connectors to install.
