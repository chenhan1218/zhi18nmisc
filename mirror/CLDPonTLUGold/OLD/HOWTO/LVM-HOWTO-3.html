<P>Ok, don't let this scare you off, but LVM comes with a lot of jargon which
you should understand lest you endanger your filesystems.
<P>We start at the bottom, more or less.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>The physical media</B><DD><P>You should take the word 'physical' with a grain of salt, though we will
initially assume it to be a simple hard disk, or a partition. Examples,
/dev/hda, /dev/hda6, /dev/sda. You can turn any consecutive number of blocks
on a block device into a ...
<DT><B>Physical Volume (PV)</B><DD><P>A PV is nothing more than a physical medium with some administrative data
added to it - once you have added this, LVM will recognise it as a holder
of ...
<DT><B>Physical Extents (PE)</B><DD><P>Physical Extents are like really big blocks, often with a size of megabytes.
PEs can be assigned to a...
<DT><B>Volume Group</B><DD><P>A VG is made up of a number of Physical Extents (which may have come from
multiple Physical Volumes or hard drives).  While it may be tempting to
think of a VG as being made up of several hard drives (/dev/hda and /dev/sda
for example), it's more accurate to say that it contains PEs which are provided
by these hard drives.
<P>>From this Volume Group, PEs can be assigned to a ...
<DT><B>Logical Volume (LV)</B><DD><P>Yes, we're finally getting somewhere. A Logical Volume is the end result of
our work, and it's there that we store our information. This is equivalent to
the historic idea of partitions.
<P>As with a regular partition, on this Logical Volume you would typically build
a ...
<DT><B>Filesystem</B><DD><P>This filesystem is whatever you want it to be: the standard ext2,
ReiserFS, NWFS, XFS, JFX, NTFS, etc...  To the linux kernel, there is
no difference between a regular partition and a Logical Volume.

<P>I've attempted some ASCII art which may help you visualise this.

<PRE>
A Physical Volume, containing Physical Extents:

  +-----[ Physical Volume ]------+
  | PE | PE | PE | PE | PE | PE  |
  +------------------------------+

A Volume Group, containing 2 Physical Volumes (PVs) with 6 Physical Extents:

  +------[ Volume Group ]-----------------+
  |  +--[PV]--------+  +--[PV]---------+  | 
  |  | PE | PE | PE |  | PE | PE | PE  |  |
  |  +--------------+  +---------------+  |
  +---------------------------------------+ 

We now further expand this:

  +------[ Volume Group ]-----------------+
  |  +--[PV]--------+  +--[PV]---------+  |
  |  | PE | PE | PE |  | PE | PE | PE  |  |
  |  +--+---+---+---+  +-+----+----+---+  |

  |   +-+---+---+-+      +----+----+--+   |
  |   |  Logical  |      |  Logical   |   |
  |   |  Volume   |      |   Volume   |   |

<P>This shows us two filesystems, spanning two disks. The /home filesystem
contains 4 Physical Extents, the /var filesystem 2.
<P>bert hubert is writing 
<A HREF="http://ds9a.nl/lvm-viewer">a tool</A> to
represent LVM more visually, a 
<A HREF="http://ds9a.nl/lvm-howto/screenshot.gif">screenshot</A> is provided. Looks better
than the ASCII art.

<P>Ok, this stuff is hard to assimilate ('We are LVM of Borg...'), so here is a
very annotated example of creating a Logical Volume. Do NOT paste this
example onto your console because you WILL destroy data, unless it happens
that on your computer /dev/hda3 and /dev/hdb2 aren't used. 
<P>When in doubt, view the ASCIIgram above.
<P>You should first set the partition types of /dev/hda3 and /dev/hdb2 to 0x8e,
which is 'Linux LVM'. Please note that your version of fdisk may not yet know
this type, so it will be listed as 'Unknown':

<P>We do the same for /dev/hdb2, but we don't display it here. This is needed
so that LVM is able to reconstruct things should you lose your
configuration.
<P>Now, this shouldn't be necessary, but some computers require a reboot at
this point. So if the following examples don't work, try rebooting.
<P>We then create our Physical Volumes, like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# pvcreate  /dev/hda3
pvcreate -- physical volume "/dev/hda3" successfully created
# pvcreate  /dev/hdb2
pvcreate -- physical volume "/dev/hdb2" successfully created
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We than add these two PVs to a Volume Group called 'test':
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# vgcreate test /dev/hdb2 /dev/hda3
vgcreate -- INFO: using default physical extent size 4 MB
vgcreate -- INFO: maximum logical volume size is 255.99 Gigabyte
vgcreate -- doing automatic backup of volume group "test"
vgcreate -- volume group "test" successfully created and activated
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So we now have an empty Volume Group, let's examine it a bit:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# vgdisplay -v test
--- Volume group ---
VG Name               test

Lots of data here - most of it should be understandable by now. We see that
there are no Logical Volumes defined, so we should work to remedy that. We
try to generate a 50 megabyte volume called 'HOWTO' in the Volume
Group 'test':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# lvcreate -L 50M -n HOWTO test 
lvcreate -- rounding up size to physical extent boundary "52 MB"
lvcreate -- doing automatic backup of "test"
lvcreate -- logical volume "/dev/test/HOWTO" successfully created

<P>Ok, we're nearly there, let's make a filesystem:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

<P>And we're done! Let's review our Volume Group, because it should be filled
up a bit by now:

<P>Well, it is. /dev/hda3 is completely unused, but /dev/hdb2 has 13 Physical
Extents in use.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Active and Inactive: kernel space and user space</A>
</H2>

<P>As with all decent operating systems, Linux is divided in two parts: kernel
space and user space. Userspace is sometimes called userland, which would
also be a good name for a theme park, 'Userland'.
<P>Discovery, creation and modification of things pertaining to Logical Volume
Management is done in user space, and then communicated to the kernel. Once
a volume group or logical volume is reported to the kernel, it is
called 'Active'. Certain changes can only be performed when an entity is
active, others only when it is not.
