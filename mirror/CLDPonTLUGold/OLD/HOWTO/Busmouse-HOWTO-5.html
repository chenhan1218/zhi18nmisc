<P>So you've read through this howto a dozen times, done everything
exactly as you think you should have, and your mouse still doesn't
work?  The best advice I can give you is this: experiment.  Sure,
it's a pain in the posterior, but in the end the only way to find
out what is going to work with your mouse is to try all of the
alternatives until you have success.
<P>As always, if there is something you don't understand, try reading
the manual page first and see if that helps.  If you have a specific
question, or a problem you think I might be able to help with, feel
free to contact me at the address listed at the top of this howto,
and I'll see if I can help you out or point you to someone who can.
<P>The <CODE>comp.os.linux.setup</CODE> newsgroup or <CODE>comp.os.linux.hardware</CODE>
is the appropriate forum for discussion and/or questions regarding setup --- 
please don't post questions to other groups, and especially don't crosspost
questions to two or more of the Linux groups, they are more than
cluttered enough as it is!  When posting, you will get a much
better response (and much fewer flames) if you use appropriate
Subject: and Keywords: lines.  For example:
