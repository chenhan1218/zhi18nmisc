<P>All these distributions are available on CD-ROM (some of the
non-commercial ones only show up on network-archive snapshots).
Most of these are available for free over the network (but the
commercial ones won't support you if you buy this way).  They are
custom-assembled, rather than just being re-packagings of a
pre-existing network release.

<DT><B>Provider's Description:</B><DD><P>Caldera is shipping OpenLinux 1.2 in a three-tiered family of 
products: OpenLinux Lite, OpenLinux Base, and OpenLinux Standard.
<P>OpenLinux Lite is a freely available evaluation of the OpenLinux
product (it includes a 90-day evalutation of the Caldera integrated 
Desttop--the full licensed version of the desktop is included in the 
Base and Standard products). OpenLinxu Lite can be downloaded from
Caldera's ftp site, or obtainded on CD for the cost of shipping. It
is also designed for use by book and software publishers to provide
a commercially stable Linux offering with their books and software 
products.
<P>OpenLinux Base contains everything that is in Lite plus it is a 
complete, easy-to-install Linux operating system, with integrated
Desktop, Internet client and server components, and Intranet 
connectivity. OpenLinux Base includes Netscape Navigator and full
documentation.
<P>OpenLinux Standard includes what is in Base plus more high-end, name
brand, commercial software components (such as Netscape FastTrack Web
Server, Netscape Navigator Gold Web browser and authoring tools, 
ADABAS D database, StarOffice productivity suite, Caldera OpenDOS, and
NetWare client and administration tools).
<P>All three tiers of the OpenLinux 1.2 release are currently available.
<P>With Caldera OpenLinux, you can see a whole world of powerful
new computing, even the power of a UNIX workstation on your PC!
By using a Linux kernel, OpenLinux gives you speed and stability
that compare to systems costing thousands of dollars. Open Linux
also gives you: 
<UL>
<LI>    Real multi-tasking runs many text or graphical applications at
once; no application can cause another to crash, unlike less robust
systems. </LI>
<LI>    The Linux 2.0 kernel gives super-fast TCP/IP access to the
Internet, plus loadable device drivers, for the most efficient use
of your system resources. </LI>
<LI>    Easy-to-follow, quick installation with menu-based choices and
auto-detection of your hardware make installation a snap on most
systems. The Getting Started Guide (included) provides a
step-by-step illustrated procedure, with troubleshooting tips.</LI>
</UL>
<P>No other Linux system includes a complete, integrated desktop
interface with configuration tools and graphical editor. Its
powerful drag-and-drop capabilities come pre-configured with
thousands of icons and application settings. The Desktop provides a
convenient place where you can store your favorite programs and
data files for instant access. The Desktop gives you:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>    Drag-and-drop launching of programs with data files. </LI>
<LI>    An integrated graphical text editor. </LI>
<LI>    Easy access to an array of powerful system configuration tools. </LI>
<LI>    A configurable icon bar, custom layouts, and preference settings. </LI>
<LI>    Powerful file management using drag-and-drop or graphical dialogs. </LI>

<DT><B>Provider's Description:</B><DD><P>Debian Linux is the result of a volunteer effort to create a
high-quality non-commercial Linux distribution.  Debian Linux 2.0
is a complete and fully-functional Unix-compatible operating system
for the personal computer.  The system uses ELF executables and
libc6 (unlikeprevious Debian versions, which used libc5).  At
present, Debian Linux is available for the IBM PC architecture
(386/486/Pentium) and m68k, with versions for Sparc and Alpha
promised for 2.1.  ARM, PPC, and UltraSparc ports are underway.
<P>Debian Linux is an easy-to-upgrade distribution that mostly
consists of freely redistributable software from a number of
different sources and systems.  Support for shadow passwords is
available, although it should be considered experimental in the 1.1
release.  Non-free packages may also obtained, making Debian a
well-rounded system.
<P>The benefits of Debian Linux are its upgradability, well-defined
dependencies between packages, and its open development.  It is the
only distribution of Linux that is being developed co-operatively
by many individuals through the Internet, in the same spirit as
Linux and other open-source operating systems.  More than 400
package maintainers are working on over 1500 packages and improving
Debian Linux.  A sophisticated bug tracking system allows users to
easily report bugs and security concerns which are quickly dealt
with by the Debian community.  A new release of the package will
soon occur on well-known ftp archives.
<P>Debian Linux is a very dynamic distribution.  Snap-shot releases
are made about every three months, the ftp archives are updated
daily.  
<P>For more information about Debian Linux, please refer to the files
at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/</A> or visit our World
Wide Web page at 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">http://www.debian.org/</A>.  There is also
a book, "Running Debian GNU/Linux", from O'Reilly &amp; Associates.
<P>If you're interested in joining this project you are invited to
subscribe to either debian-user@lists.debian.org or
debian-devel@lists.debian.org by sending a mail to
debian-user-request@lists.debian.org (or debian-devel-request

<DT><B>Provider's Description:</B><DD><P>The charter of the WGS Linux Pro CD is different from all other 
distributions currently on the market.  We are actively
pursuing penetration into the commercial marketplace for Linux.
Everything we do is aimed at increasing the size of the Linux
community, and helping Linux to become THE one true operating 
system, not just an operating system.
<P>WGS Linux Pro consists of our Main "Stable" Linux CD, for which
we select what we consider to be the best Linux distribution 
available.  Then we make bug fixes &amp; minor enhancements.  This 
CD often contains software older than the latest, under the theory 
that "the latest is not always the greatest".  Together with this 
approach we provide technical support as well as support agreements.  
For this reason WGS Linux Pro is considered a primary Linux 
distribution.  Optionally, and in addition to our primary CD, we 
supply supplemental CDs containing all the latest Linux software
(including current archives of the tsx-11, metalab, and Red Hat
sites).  Virtually anything you will get with anyone's Linux
product can be found on these supplemental CDs.  We continually add
more to these supplemental CDs as software becomes available.  Even
with all this, pricing on our product line is very favorable when
correctly compared to other Linux distributions.  Also optional
(included with Linux Pro+) is a professionally produced and printed
manual containing the Linux documentation project and more!
<P>Current version is 4.0a; kernel is 1.2.13 with installable 2.0.x
on the CD.

<DT><B>Internet Access:</B><DD><P>Look in

<DT><B>Ordering:</B><DD><P>WGS Linux Pro is available on CD from dealers and distributors
worldwide, and soon from our FTP site.
<P>You may call, fax, email, or mail us, to purchase, or request
additional information.  We will be happy to respond to any
question you have.  We accept American Express, Visa, Discover, and
MasterCard, or purchase orders with approval of credit.
<P>
<DT><B>Miscellaneous:</B><DD><P>Complete information is available on our FTP site.
<P>WGS publishes a free E-Mail newsletter on Linux and FlagShip 
to which you may subscribe by just emailing us your request.
<P>In addition we carry Motif, FlagShip, A line of books, and 
other products to make your experience with Linux more complete
and fulfilling.  Check us out!

<DT><B>Provider's Description:</B><DD><P>Red Hat 6.1 is based on the 2.2 kernel and is available for
Intel, Sparc and Alpha platforms.
<P>Four installation innovations make Red Hat the easiest Linux to
install ever.  Our graphical installation mode brings you straight
up into X for most of the installation.  Our boot disk creation script
eases selection of the proper boot disk, and it saves your existing
network configuration information and XF86Config so you don't have to
configure TCP/IP or X!  Our FTP install allows you to install simply
by downloading 3 floppy disk images -- the rest is done automatically!
And finally, the installation includes seamless support for PCMCIA
devices -- install Red Hat on your laptop as easily as on your
desktop machine!
<P>After installing Red Hat Linux once, you will never need to reinstall
Linux again!  The new RPM packaging system is sophisticated enough to
allow upgrading to new Red Hat releases without reinstalling your
system - no partitioning, no backing up all your files, no headaches.
<P>
<DT><B>Ordering:</B><DD><P>Available directly from Red Hat Software and most distributors
of Linux related products.  Please contact Red Hat Software for
ordering details (on-line ordering is available through Red Hat's
Web).  Suggested retail price for the Standard version is

$149.95; for the Deluxe version $79.95.

<DT><B>Editor's Comments:</B><DD><P>The big selling point of this distribution is RPM, the Red Hat
Package Manager.  This piece of software is a remarkable advance;
it allows you to cleanly install and de-install applications and
operating-system components, including the kernel and OS base
itself.  RPM is now used as well by essentially all other
distributions except Debian.
