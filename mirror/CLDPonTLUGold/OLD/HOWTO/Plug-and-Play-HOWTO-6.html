<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P> Just how this is done depends upon the driver.  Some drivers have
more than one way to find out how their physical device is configured.
At one extreme is the case where you must hard-code the bus-resources into
the kernel and recompile.  At the other extreme, the driver does
everything automatically and you have nothing to do.  It may even set
the bus-resources in the hardware using PnP methods.
<P>In the middle are cases where you run a program to give the resource
info to the driver or put the info in a file.  In some cases the
driver may probe for the device at addresses where it suspects the
device resides.  It may then try to test various IRQs to see which one
works.   It may or may not automatically do this.  In other cases the
driver may use PnP methods to find the device and how the bus-resources
have been set, but will not actually set them.  It may also look in
some of the files in the /proc directory.
<P>One may need to give the bus-resources as a parameter to the kernel or to
a loadable module.  See /usr/lib/modules_help/descr.gz for a list of
possible parameters.  The module to load is listed in /etc/modules
along with its parameters.  In some other case the bus-resources may be
given as parameters to the kernel.  These are put into the lilo.conf
file as append="...".   Then the lilo program must be run to save this
in the kernel boot code.
<P>While there is great non-uniformity about how drivers find out about
bus-resources, the end goal is the same.  If you're having problems
with a driver you may need to look at driver documentation (check the
kernel documentation tree).  Some brief info on a few drivers is
presented in the following sections:
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Serial Port Driver: setserial</A>
</H2>

<P> For the standard serial port driver (not for multiport cards) you
use setserial to configure the driver.  It is often run from a
start-up file.  In newer versions there is a /etc/serial.conf file
that you "edit" by simply using the setserial command in the normal
way and what you set using <CODE>setserial</CODE> is saved in the
<CODE>serial.conf</CODE> configuration file.  The <CODE>serial.conf</CODE>
file should be consulted when the <CODE>setserial</CODE> command runs from a
start-up file.  Your distribution may or may not set this up for you.
<P>There are two different ways to use <CODE>setserial</CODE> depending on the
options you give it.  One way is used to manually tell the driver the
configuration.  The other way is to probe at a given address and
report if a serial port exists there.  It can also probe this address
and try to detect what IRQ is used for this port.  The driver runs
something like <CODE>setserial</CODE> at start-up but it doesn't probe for
IRQs, it just assigns the "standard" IRQ which may be wrong.  It does
probe for the existence of a port.  See Serial-HOWTO for more details.
<P>For PCI serial, the serial driver may detect certain modems and
configure the bus-resources.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Sound Card Drivers </A>
</H2>

<H3>OSS-Lite</H3>

<P> You must give the IO, IRQ, and DMA as parameters to a module
or compile them into the kernel.  But some PCI cards will get
automatically detected (likely by using the lspci command or the like).
RedHat supplies a program "sndconfig" which detects ISA PnP cards and
automatically sets up the modules for loading with the detected
bus-resources.
<P>
<H3>OSS (Open Sound System) and ALSA</H3>

<P> These will detect the card by PnP methods and then select the
appropriate driver and load it.  It will also set the bus-resources on an
ISA-PnP card.  You may need to manually intervene to avoid conflicts.
For the ALSA driver, support for ISA-PnP is optional and you may use
isapnp tools if you want to.
