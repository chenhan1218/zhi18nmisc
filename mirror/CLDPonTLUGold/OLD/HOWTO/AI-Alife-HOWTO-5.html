<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Alife &amp; Complex Systems</A>    </H2>

<P> 
<P>Alife takes yet another approach to exploring the mysteries of
intelligence.  It has many aspects similar to EC and Connectionism, but
takes these ideas and gives them a meta-level twist. Alife emphasizes the
development of intelligence through <I>emergent</I> behavior of
<I>complex adaptive systems</I>.  Alife stresses the social or group
based aspects of intelligence. It seeks to understand life and survival. By
studying the behaviors of groups of 'beings' Alife seeks to discover the
way intelligence or higher order activity emerges from seemingly simple
individuals. Cellular Automata and Conway's Game of Life are probably the
most commonly known applications of this field. Complex Systems
(abbreviated CS) are very similar to alife in the way the are approached,
just more general in definition (ie.  alife is a type of complex system).
Usually complex system software takes the form of a simulator.

<P>Biome is a C++ library aimed at individual-based/agent-based
simulations. It is somewhat similar to Swarm, EcoSim or Simex but tries
to be more efficient and less monolithic without compromising object-
oriented design. Currently there is an event based scheduling system, a
C++ified Mersenne-Twister RNG, several general analysis classes, some
Qt-based GUI classes, a very basic persistence/database framework (used
also for parameter storage) and many other small useful things.

<P>The Integrating Modelling Toolkit (IMT) is a generic, comprehensive,
and extensible set of abstractions allowing definition and use of
interoperable model components.  Modellers create an IMT "world" made
of IMT "agents" that will perform each a particular phase of a
modelling task.  The core set of IMT agents can describe generic,
modular, distributed model components, either native to the IMT or
integrating existing simulation toolkits, specialized for tasks that
range from simple calculation of functions in an interpreted language
to spatially explicit simulation, model optimization, GIS analysis,
visualization and advanced statistical analysis.  IMT agents are
designed to easily "glue" together in higher-level simulations
integrating different modelling paradigms and toolkits.  The IMT can be
easily extended by users and developers through a convenient plug-in
mechanism

<P>The universal constructor of John von Neumann is an extension of
the logical concept of universal computing machine.  In the cellular
environment proposed by von Neumann both computing and constructive
universality can be achieved.  Von Neumann proved that in his cellular
lattice both a Turing machine and a machine capable of producing any
other cell assembly, when fed with a suitable program, can be
embedded. He called the latter machine a ''universal
constructor'' and showed that, when provided with a program
containing its own description, this is capable of self-reproducing.

primarily for use as a platform in Artificial Life research. The avida
system is based on concepts similar to those employed by the tierra
program, that is to say it is a population of self-reproducing strings
with a Turing-complete genetic basis subjected to Poisson-random
mutations. The population adapts to the combination of an intrinsic
fitness landscape (self-reproduction) and an externally imposed
(extrinsic) fitness function provided by the researcher. By studying 
this system, one can examine evolutionary adaptation, general traits of
living systems (such as self-organization), and other issues pertaining
to theoretical or evolutionary biology and dynamic systems.

ant (or ants) start out on a grid. Each cell is either black or white.
If the ant is on a black square, it turns right 90 and moves forward
one unit. If the ant is on a white square, it turns left 90 and moves
forward one unit.  And when the ant leaves a square, it inverts the
color. The neat thing about Langton's Ant is that no matter what
pattern field you start it out on, it eventually builds a "road," which
is a series of 117 steps that repeat indefinitely, each time leaving
the ant displaced one pixel vertically and horizontally.
