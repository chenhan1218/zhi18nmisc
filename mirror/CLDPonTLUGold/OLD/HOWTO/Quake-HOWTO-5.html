<UL>
<LI><B>Case sensitivity</B> - In DOS and Windows, case is not important.
<CODE>BASE1.TXT</CODE> is the same as <CODE>base1.txt</CODE>.  Under Linux and other
unices, case IS significant.  <CODE>MOTD.TXT</CODE> and <CODE>motd.txt</CODE> are
different files.  This can cause problems with player models and skin files
if they're installed with upper- or mixed-case filenames.
<CODE>players/male/santa.PCX</CODE> needs to be renamed to <CODE>santa.pcx</CODE> in
order to work in Linux.  The <CODE>fixskins.sh</CODE> script included with 
quakeworld will convert all filenames in a directory to lowercase. It's
reproduced below for your convenience:
<HR>
<PRE>
     #!/bin/sh
     for x in *; do
        y=`echo $x | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`
        if [ $x != $y ]; then
           mv $x $y
        fi
     done
     
</PRE>
<HR>

</LI>
<LI><B>Path delimiters</B> - DOS and Windows use the backslash "<CODE>\</CODE>"
character to separate file pathname elements.  In Unix, the backslash is an escape
character.  If you use file pathnames in your config files (or your mod code, or
anywhere else, for that matter), be sure you're using "<CODE>/</CODE>" and not "<CODE>\</CODE>".
</LI>
<LI><B>End of line characters</B> - Under DOS/Windows, each line of a text file
ends with a carriage return character (CR) and a linefeed character (LF).  Unix
textfiles just have a linefeed at the end of each line.  Using DOS/Win formatted
textfiles in Unix can cause all kinds of mysterious Quake problems.  Using the
incorrectly formatted <CODE>quake2.conf</CODE> file from the Quake2 3.17 package, for
example, gives the error "<CODE>LoadLibrary("ref_XXX.so") failed: No such file or
directory</CODE>".  LMCTF-TE reports a floating point exception.
If you've got an problem you can't explain, try removing the CRs from your text
files:  
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     mv file.txt file.bak; tr -d '\r' &lt; file.bak > file.txt
     
</PRE>

</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="glibc"></A> Glibc, RedHat 5.x, Debian 2 considerations **</H3>

<P>The following applies the Quake I binaries (<CODE>squake</CODE>,
<CODE>glquake</CODE>, and <CODE>quake.x11</CODE>) only.  As of versions
2.30 and 3.19 respectively, QuakeWorld and Quake II are available
in both libc5 and glibc versions.
<P>The Quake executables were compiled with libc5.  Newer Linux
distributions like RedHat 5.1 and Debian 2.0 use the incompatible
glibc as their default C library.  If you're running Quake on a
glibc system, there are a few things to watch out for:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Both RedHat 5 and Debian 2 have libc5 compatibility packages that allow
you to run libc5-based applications.  Make sure you have these packages installed.
Both distributions put the libc5-based libraries in <CODE>/usr/i486-linux-libc5/lib</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>Make sure Quake uses the correct libraries.  Create a script like the one below 
that points <CODE>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> to your compatibility libraries directory before
it runs Quake.
<HR>
<PRE>
     #!/bin/sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/i486-linux-libc5/lib
     ./quake2 +set vid_ref gl $*
     
</PRE>
<HR>
</LI>
<LI>If you are going to compile a library like SVGAlib or Mesa
for use with Quake, it must be compiled with libc5 and friends.
Simply building a new library according its installation
instructions will result in a library that is linked against your
default library, glibc.  You must ensure your new library is
linked only with libc5 and libc5-based libraries so it will be
compatible with Quake.  See your distribution's documentation for
information on linking to the non-default libraries.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H3>My mouse doesn't work or seems to respond randomly. </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Is gpm running?  gpm is a program that enables you to cut and paste
with the mouse in virtual consoles.  Many distributions enable it by
default.  It may be interfering with Quake.  Check if it's running with
the following command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     ps aux | grep gpm
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you get output like
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     root      6115  0.0  0.4   832   316  ?  S   17:54   0:00 gpm -t PS/2
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

then gpm is running and interfering with Quake.  <CODE>gpm -k</CODE> (as root)
ought to stop gpm.  If it doesn't (<CODE>gpm -k</CODE> doesn't always work on 
my system),  kill gpm with the command <CODE>killall gpm</CODE>.

If you never use gpm, you may want to stop it from running at startup.
See the documentation for your distribution for information on how to do
this.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Is your mouse defined properly in <CODE>libvga.config</CODE>?  This file
usually lives in <CODE>/etc</CODE> or <CODE>/etc/vga</CODE>.  Open it up and look
for a line like
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     mouse Microsoft
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

On my system, this is the first option in the file.  Make sure the mouse
type is appropriate for your hardware.  
     </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>My Microsoft Intellimouse or Logitech MouseMan+ isn't working correctly. </H3>

<P>SVGAlib, which handles mouse input for SVGA and GL Quake/QW/Q2,
didn't directly support the Intellimouse until version 1.3.0.  If you have a
version of SVGAlib prior to 1.3.0, you should upgrade, then use mouse
type <CODE>IntelliMouse</CODE> (for serial mice) or <CODE>IMPS2</CODE> (for
PS/2 mice) in your <CODE>libvga.config</CODE> file.
<P>
<H3>My mouse is "laggy" and seems much slower than under Windows.</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>For many people, just cranking up the value of
<CODE>sensitivity</CODE> in the game console cures the problem.
Setting <CODE>sensitivity</CODE> by hand in the console or in a
<CODE>.cfg</CODE> file allows you to increase the mouse sensitivity
more than the slider in the Options menu.  <CODE>sensitivity 15</CODE>,
for example.
</LI>
<LI> From Zoid's 1/7/98 .plan update:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are experience video 'lag' in the GL renderer (the frame
rate feels like it's lagging behind your mouse movement) type 
"gl_finish 1" in the console. This forces update on a per frame
basis.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI>The latest version of SVGAlib (1.3.0) provides a slew of parameters
in <CODE>libvga.config</CODE> that you can use to customize the behavior of 
your mouse.  With the proper settings it should be possible to make your
mouse feel any way you want.  On my system, just changing
<CODE>mouse_accel_type</CODE> to <CODE>normal</CODE> (default is <CODE>power</CODE>)
gave me the results I wanted.  I haven't messed with the other settings,
and I don't pretend to have a clue about what they all do.
</LI>
<LI>The little slider</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>I have a Voodoo2, and, when I try to run with the gl renderer, it reports that I don't have a Voodoo card installed.</H3>

<P>There are different versions of Glide for Voodoo and Voodoo 2 cards.  Be
sure you downloaded the correct one for your system.
<P>
<P>
<H3>When I'm playing any of the Quake games under SVGAlib or GL and press CTRL-C, the game exits and sometimes leaves my console in an unusable state.</H3>

<H3>Sometimes when Quake/Quake II exits abnormally, it leaves my console unusable.</H3>

<P>Yes.  This bites.  SVGAlib catches the CTRL-C and decides what to do with
it instead of allowing Quake to handle it.  I know of no way around this
short of hacking SVGAlib.  
<P>If you run your Quake games from a script that resets the
keyboard and terminal like the one below, you'll run
less chance of ending up with a hosed terminal if this does happen, though.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
     #!/bin/sh
     ./quake2 $*
     kbd_mode -a
     reset
     
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>squake/quake2 fails to start and says "<CODE>svgalib: cannot get I/O permissions"</CODE></H3>

<P>The Quake executables must run as root, so you must either run them as
root or make them setuid root.  See the installation instructions in this
document for details.
<P>
<H3>Sometimes after  playing one of the Quake games in X, key repeat doesn't work any more.</H3>

<P>For some reason, the X11 versions of Quake disable key repeat while
they're running.  If the program exits abnormally for some reason, key
repeat never get turned back on. Do
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     xset r on
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to reenable it.
<P>
<H3>Quake/Quake II says "/dev/dsp : device not configured" </H3>

<P>Your sound hardware is not properly configured.  You may simply need to do
a <CODE>insmod sound</CODE>, or it may be necessary to rebuild your kernel.
RedHat users may need to invoke the <B>sndconfig(8)</B> utility.
See the documentation for your Linux distribution and/or the Linux Sound
HOWTO for information on configuring your system's sound hardware.
<P>
<H3>GL Quake/Quake II run slower in Linux than in Windows. **</H3>

<P>The Windows 3Dfx GL miniport is heavily optimized for the things
Quake II does.  Mesa on the other hand, is more general and less optimized
As a result, Linux Quake II runs slower than under Windows.  This isn't a
limitation of Linux, but a limitation of the current drivers. 
<P>With the most recent releases of QuakeWorld and Quake II, the
3Dfx miniport mentioned above is available for Linux.  While it
still doesn't bring Linux Quake performance to par with Windows
Quake, it's another step in that direction.
<P>Additionally, for Pentium Pro and Pentium II users, there are
some tweaks than can be done with memory buffering - the latest
<CODE>/dev/3dfx</CODE> device driver has support for automatically
setting this up for you.  Enabling MTRRs can result in
<EM>significant</EM> (10 fps on my system) GL Quake speedups. See 
<A HREF="http://glide.xxedgexx.com/MTRR.html">http://glide.xxedgexx.com/MTRR.html</A> for some more
detailed information about this.
<P>
<H3>How can I start a server and log off, then come back to it later? **</H3>

<P><B>screen(1)</B> is a great utility for this sort of thing.  It
allows you to create many virtual screens in one tty and switch
between them.
Screen comes with most distributions.  You can download it from 
<A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu</A>
or any GNU mirror.
<P>Start screen by typing the command <CODE>screen</CODE>, then create a new
screen window by pressing CTRL-A CTRL-C.  You won't see much as
you do these things, but be assured, something is happening.  
<P>Start a Quakeworld server:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     /usr/local/games/quake/qwsv 
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now open a new screen window with CTRL-A CTRL-C and start up a 
Quake II server:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     /usr/local/games/quake2/quake2 +set dedicated 1
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can switch back and forth between your servers by pressing
CTRL-A CTRL-N.
<P>Press CTRL-A CTRL-D to detach from the screen program.  Screen
and your servers are still running, but they're no longer visible
in your terminal window.  You can logoff now and your processes
will continue to run normally.
<P>Use <CODE>screen -r</CODE> to re-attach to your previous screen
process and access your servers again.  
<P>That's all there is to it.  See the <B>screen(1)</B> man page
for more detailed information.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Quake/QuakeWorld</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>Quake dies at startup with a segmentation fault. </H3>

<P>This usually means your network setup isn't right.  Try starting quake
with the <CODE>-noudp</CODE> option and see if the error goes away.  If that
fixes it, check your <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE> file and verify there's an 
entry for your machine in it.  Use 127.0.0.1 for your IP address if you
have a dialup account that gives you a different address each time you 
connect.
<P>
<H3>What's the difference between <CODE>glqwcl</CODE>, <CODE>glqwcl.3dfxgl</CODE>, and <CODE>glqwcl.glx</CODE>? ++</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B><CODE>glqwcl</CODE></B> is the standard GL Quakeworld client you've
seen in previous versions.  It's linked against libMesaGL.so.2.</LI>
<LI><B><CODE>glqwcl.3dfxgl</CODE></B> is a script that runs <CODE>glqwcl</CODE>
after preloading the 3Dfx GL miniport library, <CODE>lib3dfxgl.so</CODE>.  Preloading
the minport library causes its GL functions to get used instead of Mesa's.  Since
the GL minport is optimized for Quake, this is a good thing.</LI>
<LI><B><CODE>glqwcl.glx</CODE></B> is linked against standard OpenGL libriaries
instead of Mesa.  This will allow glquake to run on other 3D hardware that is 
supported by some other OpenGL implementation.  This is an X application and 
so must be run from X.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>When I run <CODE>glqwcl.glx</CODE> fullscreen from X, I can't use my mouse or keyboard. ++</H3>

<P>
<P>Run <CODE>glqwcl.glx</CODE> with the <CODE>+_windowed_mouse 1</CODE>
option. GLX Quakeworld is running in a window, even though it
appears to take up your whole screen.  If you move the mouse
while the WM is in focus-follows-mouse mode, you're likely to
move the pointer outside this window, and then Quake will stop
responding to mouse and keyboard input.  <CODE>+_windowed_mouse 1</CODE>
makes Quakeworld grab the mouse exclusively.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Quake II</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>When I try to run Quake II with the GL renderer, it fails and says "LoadLibrary("ref_gl.so") failed: Unable to resolve symbol"</H3>

<P>If immediately prior to the "Unable to resolve symbol" line, you have 
messages like "<CODE>can't resolve symbol 'fxMesaCreateContext'</CODE>", your
Mesa library doesn't have glide support compiled in.  
See section 
<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-3.html#quake2-gl">The GL renderer</A> in the 
Quake II installation section for information on installing Mesa and
glide.
<P>
<H3>Quake II fails with the message <CODE>LoadLibrary("ref_XXX.so") failed: No such file or directory </CODE></H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>/etc/quake2.conf</CODE> doesn't have the correct path to your
Quake II directory in it.  This file should contain one line that is the
directory Quake II lives in.
</LI>
<LI>If <CODE>/etc/quake2.conf</CODE> <EM>does</EM> contain the correct
path, try removing the file and re-creating it by hand.  Some versions of 
Quake II for Linux included an incorrectly formatted <CODE>quake2.conf</CODE>
file.  
     </LI>
<LI>Do you have SVGAlib installed?  Check <CODE>/lib</CODE>,
<CODE>/usr/lib</CODE> and <CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE> for a file called
<CODE>libvga.so.1.X.X</CODE>, where the X's are some numbers.  If nothing
turns up, you need to get and install SVGAlib to run Quake II outside of 
X.
</LI>
<LI>If the renderer in question is <CODE>ref_gl.so</CODE>, Mesa may not be
properly installed.  Did you copy <CODE>libMesaGL.so.2.6</CODE> to a 
library directory like the installation instruactions told you to?  
     </LI>
<LI>If the renderer in question is <CODE>ref_gl.so</CODE>, did you install
the glide libraries?

<H3><A NAME="3.17"></A> Note about the 3.17 distribution</H3>

<P>
<P>As of this writing, the most recent Quake II version is 3.19.  If
for some reason, you're running version 3.17 instead, the
following information may be helpful to you.
<P>Two text files (<CODE>quake2.conf</CODE> and <CODE>fixperms.sh</CODE>) in the 3.17
distribution were inadvertently saved in MS-DOS CR/LF text-file format
instead of the unix LF format.  This means there's an extra carriage
return character at the end of each line in these files and they're not 
going to behave right until you fix them.
<P>We'll run them through <B>tr(1)</B> to strip out the CR's. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>
<H3>When I run Quake II with <CODE>+set vid_ref glx</CODE> fullscreen from X, I can't use my mouse or keyboard. ++</H3>

<P>
<P>Run GLX <CODE>quake2</CODE> with the <CODE>+set _windowed_mouse 1</CODE>
option. GLX Quake2 is running in a window, even though it
appears to take up your whole screen.  If you move the mouse
while the WM is in focus-follows-mouse mode, you're likely to
move the pointer outside this window, and then Quake II will stop
responding to mouse and keyboard input.  <CODE>+set _windowed_mouse
1</CODE> makes Quake II grab the mouse exclusively.
<P>
<H3>Why can't I change to some of the SVGA modes that aree in the Quake II Video menu? **</H3>

<P>SVGAlib probably doesn't know how to create the modes on your card.
When Quake II starts up with the SVGA renderer (<CODE>ref_soft.so</CODE>),
it prints a list of all the modes that SVGAlib tells it are available:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     ------- Loading ref_soft.so -------
     Using RIVA 128 driver, 4096KB.
     mode 320: 200 1075253220
     mode 320: 240 1075253220
     mode 320: 400 1075253220
     mode 360: 480 1075253220
     mode 640: 480 1075253220
     mode 800: 600 1075253220
     mode 1024: 768 1075253220
     mode 1280: 1024 1075253220
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

These are the only modes you will be able to successfully switch to from 
the Video menu.  If say, 512x384 isn't on the list, selecting it from the
Video menu won't work.
<P>SVGAlib does let you define new video modes for some chipsets in
<CODE>libvga.config</CODE>, so you may be able create your own video mode this
way.  See the SVGAlib documentation for more detail on this topic.
