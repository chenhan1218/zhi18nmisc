<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Using your mouse.</A></H2>

<P>This section deals with the general use of your mouse with various
applications.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Configuring Applications</A>
</H2>

<P>Most Linux Distributions will prompt you for what type of mouse you have
during installation and then setup both gpm and X windows for you.  If you
do not select the correct mouse protocol or install new mouse hardware
you can usually run a command line program that will reconfigure both
gpm and X windows to use the new protocol.
<P>
<H3>Redhat</H3>

<P>Under RedHat you can run /usr/sbin/mouseconfig.
<P>
<H3>Other configurations</H3>

<P>Consult your installation documents for what to run under other distributions.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="gpm"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 gpm.</A>
</H2>

<P>Gpm is a program which allows you to do mouse based 'cut-
and-paste' between Linux virtual consoles, much like you can under X, and 
is a good way of testing your mouse out.  The most current version of gpm
can be found at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.prosa.it/pub/gpm">ftp://ftp.prosa.it/pub/gpm</A>.  Most Linux distributions come with a precompiled gpm binary.
<P>When invoking gpm, use the -t switch to indicate which protocol your mouse 
is using and the -m option to indicate which mouse device you are using. 
Three protocols useful for most busmice are logi, bm, and ps2.  The default 
for mouse device is to use <CODE>/dev/mouse</CODE>, so you can omit 
the -m option if you have the appropriate symbolic link.  An example for
a Microsoft Inport mouse is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
gpm -t bm
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or if you use the PS/2 protocol:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
gpm -t ps2
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You should then be able move your mouse and see a block move around the
screen and also be able to cut and paste text between virtual
consoles using the mouse buttons.  Read the documentation with
gpm, or do a ``man gpm'' for more information on how
to operate it.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 XFree86.</A>
</H2>

<P>To use your busmouse under XFree86, you will need to set your
mouse protocol type in your Xconfig file. If you have a BusMouse
protocol mouse, your Xconfig should contain (including the quotes)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Section "Pointer"
  Protocol "Busmouse"
  Device   "/dev/mouse"
  
  # Any other options such as Emulate3Buttons
EndSection
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For PS/2 mice change the protocol line to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  Protocol        "PS/2"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you have a two button mouse, it should also contain the line
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  Emulate3Buttons
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>which will allow you to emulate the use of the middle mouse button
by pressing both mouse buttons simultaneously.
All other mouse related lines, such as ``BaudRate'' and ``SampleRate''
should be commented out, as these have no effect on bus mice.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 XFree86 and gpm.</A>
</H2>

<P>For a long period of the kernel developement, it was not possible
to share busmice between processes.  Because of this it was hard to run 
both XFree86 and gpm at the same time. If you try to run X with gpm running 
and you get errors like the following then you know you are using one of 
these older kernels.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Fatal server error:
Cannot open mouse (Device or resource busy)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There are two meathods of getting gpm working with XFree86 with these 
kernels.  The first is to kill any copy of gpm you have running before 
you start up XFree86.  The second is to use gpm's "repeater" option
(it takes mouse data and repeats the information to multiple applications).
<P>I would recommend upgrading your kernel if possible so that
you can share busmice between processes.  For this document, I will only 
explain the simplest meathod of using XFree86 and gpm together with older
kernels.  Please see gpm's documentation if you would like to use the repeater
meathod.
<P>Gpm allows you to terminate running copies of itself by executing:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
gpm -k
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This should be done before starting up X11.  Take whatever script
you use to start up your X session, such as <CODE>startx</CODE>, and
add the above command to the top of the script so that gpm is 
shut down automatically.  You may wish to also put a command that
restarts gpm at the bottom of the script so that it restarts upon
exiting your X session.
<P>
