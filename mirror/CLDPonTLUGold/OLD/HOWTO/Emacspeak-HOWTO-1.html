<P>Emacspeak is an Emacs subsystem that allows
the user to get feedback using synthesized speech.
<P>Screen reading programs allow a visually impaired user to get
feedback using synthesized speech. Such programs have been
commercially available for well over a decade. Most of them run on
PC's under DOS, and there are now a few screen-readers for the
Windows platform.  However, screen-readers for the UNIX environment
have been conspicuous in their absence.
<P>This means that most visually impaired computer users
face the additional handicap of being DOS-impaired :-)
<P>Emacspeak is an emacs subsystem that provides basic speech access.
Emacspeak will always have the shortcoming that it will only work
under Emacs.  This said, there is very little that cannot be done
inside Emacs, so it's not a real shortcoming:-) Within Emacs, you can
open a "shell window" where you can run commands and examine their output,
even output which has scrolled out of the window.  Emacs provides
special modes for running certain commands.  For example, it can parse
error messages printed by a compiler and open a separate edit window
with the cursor at the point of the error.  It can also run a debugger
and keep a separate edit window open at the point in the source code
corresponding to the program counter.
<P>Emacspeak does have a significant advantage: since it runs inside
Emacs, a structure-sensitive, fully customizable editor, Emacspeak
often has more context-specific information about what it is speaking
than its commercial counterparts.  In this sense, Emacspeak is not a
"screenreader", it is a subsystem that produces speech output.  A
traditional screen-reader speaks the content of the screen, leaving
it to the user to interpret the visually laid-out information.
Emacspeak, on the other hand, treats speech as a first-class output
mode; it speaks the information in a manner that is easy to
comprehend when listening.
<P>This initial version provides a basic speech subsystem for Emacs;
using Emacs' power and flexibility, it has proven straightforward to
add modules that customize how things are spoken, e.g. depending on
the major/minor mode of a given buffer.  Note that the basic speech
functionality provided by Emacspeak is sufficient to use most Emacs
packages effectively; adding package-specific customizations makes
the interaction much smoother.  This is because package-specific
extensions can take advantage of the current context.
<P>Emacspeak will only work with emacs.  However, emacs can be used to
run any program that has a command-line interface (ls, cd, rm,
adduser, etc.).  In general use M-x shell to run such programs.
<P>You can even run those like less or lynx which use escape sequences
to control the appearance of the screen.  The key to this is term
mode, which you get with the emacs command M-x term.  
<P>Let me insert here some explanation, because the word "terminal" is
used in several senses.  The original terminal was of course an
electromechanical device that translated keystrokes into character
codes and received the same codes and printed the characters.
Eventually these were replaced by entirely electronic "dumb terminals"
which also implemented escape sequences to clear the screen, move the
cursor, etc.  Unix adapted to these by introducing an abstract notion
of a "terminal" with very general capabilities.  A program like a text
editor issues generic commands, which are translated into
the commands suitable for your terminal.  The choice of translation is
controlled by the variable "TERM" in the environment.  One common
value for this variable is "vt100", since many terminals implement the
same commands as the DEC VT100.  The Emacs command `M-x term' starts a
virtual terminal with its own set of cursor commands.  It notifies the
operating system of this by setting the environment variable "TERM" to
the value "eterm" (which is why it is sometimes called eterm mode).
<P>Note that this Unix "terminal" is concerned only with escape
commands for the display.  Let me just mention a couple of other kinds
of "terminal" to distinguish them from the Unix concept: For DOS,
there are "terminal emulators" like COMMO and TELIX that simulate a
terminal, and can be used to connect to a remote computer via a serial
port (and usually a modem).  That is, they accept keystrokes and send
the character codes out a serial port, and receive character codes
from the serial port and display them.  Unix has similar programs,
such as minicom and seyon.  Both DOS and Unix have another program
called "telnet" which can establish a similar connection to a separate
computer using the Internet (that is, a TCP/IP connection rather than
a serial connection).  The program "kermit" is available for both DOS
and Unix, and can establish either kind of connection.  However, none
of these should be confused with the eterm mode of emacs.  There is
nothing about eterm mode that implies a connection to a remote
computer.
<P>Note that in most cases there is an emacs mode that works better
than the separate program in an eterm buffer.  That is, instead of
"less", just open a buffer on the file.  Instead of "lynx", use w3.
Instead of "man", use `M-x man', and type the name of the program in
the minibuffer.  
<P>Remember, though: ordinary command-line oriented programs are best
run in shell mode, which starts with the command `M-x shell'.
<P>Emacs is a large program, but it does not all have to be in RAM,
because Linux has virtual memory.  You can designate a swap partition,
so that programs (or parts of programs) can be swapped out when they
are not being used.  You can comfortably run emacs with 8 MB of ram
plus 8 MB of swap space.
<P>This document is limited to the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Linux (not Free BSD)</LI>
<LI>The Slackware distribution (not Red Hat, Debian, etc.)</LI>
<LI>Speech output only (not Braille - see the Access HOWTO)</LI>
<LI>DECtalk (Dectalk Express and
MultiVoice), DoubleTalk, LiteTalk,
Braille 'n Speak, Type 'n Speak,
Braille Lite, Apollo, and Accent
synthesizers (--not the SmarTalk, a sound card, etc.)</LI>
<LI>Use of Emacs, with T. V. Raman's Emacspeak package, to drive the

</UL>
<P>The use of adaptive technology with Linux, and in
particular, using adaptive technology to make Linux accessible to
those who could not use it otherwise, is covered in the Linux Access
HOWTO.
<P>If you would like to help extend this document to cover one or more of
the other alternatives, or point me to a discussion
somewhere else, please contact me.
<P>The most recent version of this document should be available in
several formats at 
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/</A> and its mirrors
(see below).  The plain text version should be available at 
<A HREF="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/doc/">ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/doc/</A>.
<P>Emacspeak was written by T. V. Raman <CODE>raman@adobe.com</CODE>.  Emacspeak
has a Web page at 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/emacspeak/emacspeak.html">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/emacspeak/emacspeak.html</A>.
<P>Emacspeak supports several speech synthesizers.  The software required
depends on which you have.
<P>If you have a DECtalk Express or MultiVoice, you need the basic
Emacspeak package, tcl (an interpreter), and tclx (extensions for
tcl).  You can get the source package for Emacspeak from the Emacspeak
web page.
You can also get a binary package for a Red Hat distribution, either
from the Emacspeak web page or one prepared by Matt Campbell.
I maintain binary packages for the Debian distribution.
At this writing, the most recent
release of Emacspeak is version 13.0.  Here are some URLs:

<P>For the internal DECtalk PC, you also need a kernel driver which is
available from
<A HREF="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/dectalk_pc-0.91.tgz">ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/dectalk_pc-0.91.tgz</A><P>Extract it with the command: `tar xfz dectalk_pc-0.91.tgz'
and then follow the installation instructions found in the README file.
This driver apparently works with both the original DECTALK-pc and the new
DECTALK-PC II.
<P>For the external DoubleTalk, LiteTalk, Accent, or Apollo synthesizers,
or for the Braille 'n Speak, Type 'n Speak, or Braille Lite
devices in "speech box" mode, you need the Emacspeak
package and a separate "speech server" which comes in the emacspeak-ss package:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-ss-1.7.tar.gz">ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-ss-1.7.tar.gz</A></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For the internal DoubleTalk, you need three pieces of software: the
basic Emacspeak package, the emacspeak-ss package, and
a device driver.  The device driver is
now part of the official Linux kernel sources.  Use version 2.2.17 or
later, and configure with "Double Talk PC internal speech card
support" either compiled into the kernel or installed as a module
(dtlk.o).
<P>There is a server for the Braille 'n Speak,
Braille Lite, and Type 'n Speak devices used in "speech box" mode:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-bs-tcl-1.2.tar.gz">ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-bs-tcl-1.2.tar.gz</A>
<A HREF="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-bs-tcl_1.2-1_all.deb">ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-bs-tcl_1.2-1_all.deb</A>
<A HREF="ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-bs-1.2-1.i386.rpm">ftp://leb.net/pub/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-bs-1.2-1.i386.rpm</A></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once again, the emacspeak-ss server handles all the synthesizers other
than the DECtalk.  You should use that one if you don't mind
building and installing a source package.
<P>Computer hardware, Unix user commands, Unix system administration,
Emacs, and Emacspeak are each substantial subjects.  Attempting to
learn all of them at once is likely to lead to frustration.  Instead,
I suggest that the new user go through a sequence of stages, learning
about only one system at a time.
