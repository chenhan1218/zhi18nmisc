<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Modems for a Linux PC</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="int_vs_ext"></A> <A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 External vs. Internal </A>
</H2>

<P> A modem for a PC may be either internal or external.  The
internal one is installed inside of your PC (you must remove screws,
etc. to install it) and the external one just plugs into a serial port
connector on a PC.  Internal modems are less expensive, are less
likely to to suffer data loss due to buffer overrun, usually use less
electricity, and use up no space on your desk.  
<P>External modems are usually easier to install and usually require less
configuration.  They have lights which may give you a clue as to what
is happening and aid in troubleshooting.  The fact that the serial
port and modem can be physically separated also aids in
troubleshooting.  External modems are easy to move to another
computer.  
<P>Unfortunately most external modems have no switch to turn off the
power supply when not in use and thus are likely to consume a little
electricity even when turned off (unless you unplug the power supply
from the wall).  Each watt they draw costs you about $1/yr.  Another
possible disadvantage of an external is that you will be forced to use
an existing serial port which may not support a speed of over 115,200
bps (although as of late 1998 and late 2000 most new internal modems
don't either --but some do).  If a new internal modem had say a 16650
UART it would put less load on the CPU.
<P>Internal modems present a special problem for Linux, but will work
just as well as external modems provided you avoid the high percentage
of them that will work only for MS Windows, and also provided that you
spend time (sometimes a lot of time) to configure them correctly.
Some of the modems which will work only under MS Windows are,
unfortunately, not labeled as such.  If you buy a new one, make sure
that you can return it for a refund if it will not work under Linux.
<P>While most new modems are plug-and-play you have various ways to deal
with the PnP configuring:
<UL>
<LI> The serial driver does it all for you (more likely for a PCI modem)</LI>
<LI> Use the "isapnp" program </LI>
<LI> Let a PnP BIOS do the configuring</LI>
</UL>

Each of the above has shortcomings.  Isapnp documentation is difficult
to understand although reading the Plug-and-Play-HOWTO (long) will aid
in understanding it.  If you want the PnP BIOS to do the configuring,
all you need to do is to make sure that it knows you don't have a PnP
operating system.  But it may not do it correctly and you may need to
find out what it's done see 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-6.html#io-irq_in_hdw">What is set in my serial port hardware?</A>.
<P>There are many Linux users that say that it's a lot simpler just to
get an external modem and plug it in.  But since new peripherals are
PnP today, you will sometime need to deal with it, so why delay the
inevitable?  Still, the most expedient (and expensive) solution is an
external modem (if you have a free serial port).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 External Modems</A>
</H2>

<H3>PnP External Modems</H3>

<P> Many external modems are labeled "Plug and Play" (PnP) but they
should all work fine as non-PnP modems.  While the serial port itself
may need to be configured (IRQ number and IO address) unless the
default configuration is OK an external modem uses no such IRQ/IO
configuration.  You just plug the modem into the serial port.
Since you usually plug the modem into a serial port (and connect it to
power).
<P>How can an external modem be called PnP since it can't be configured
by PnP?   Well, it has a special PnP identification built into it that
can be read (thru the serial port) by a PnP operating system.  Such an
operating system would then know that you have a modem on a certain
port and would also know the model number.  Then you might not need to
configure application programs by telling them what port the modem is
on (such as /dev/ttyS2 or COM3).  But since you don't have such a PnP
operating system you will need to configure your application program
manually by giving it the /dev id (such as /dev/ttyS2).
<P>
<H3>Cabling &amp; Installation</H3>

<P> Connecting an external modem is simple compared to connecting
most other devices to a serial port that require various types of
"null modem" cables (which will not work for modems).  Modems use
straight through cable, with no pins crossed over.  Most computer
stores should have this.  Make sure you get the correct gender and
number of pins.  Hook up your modem to one of your serial ports.  If
you are willing to accept the default IRQ and IO address of the port
you connect it to, then you are ready to start your communication
program and configure the modem itself.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Internal Modems</A>
</H2>

<P> An internal modem is installed in a PC by taking off the cover of
the PC and inserting the modem card into a vacant slot on the
motherboard.  There are modems for the ISA slots and others for the
PCI slots.  Some new PC don't have any ISA slots.  While external
modems plug into the serial port (via a short cable) the internal
modems have the serial port built into the modem.  In other words, the
modem card is both a serial port and a modem.  
<P>Setting the IO address and IRQ for a serial port was formerly done by
jumpers on the card.  These are little black rectangular "cubes" about
5x4x2 mm in size which push in over pins on the card.  Plug-and-Play
modems (actually the serial port part of the modems) don't use jumpers
for setting these but instead are configured by sending configuration
commands to them over the bus inside the computer.  Such configuration
commands can be sent by a PnP BIOS, by the isapnp program (for the ISA
bus only), or by newer serial device drivers for certain modems. Under
Linux you have a choice of how to configure the ones that don't get
io-irq configured by the serial driver.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Use "isapnp" which may be run automatically at every boot-time </LI>
<LI> Let a PnP BIOS do it, and then maybe tell setserial the IO and
IRQ</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="soft_modem"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Software-based Modems (winmodems) </A>
</H2>

<H3>Introduction software modems (winmodems)</H3>

<P> Software modems turn over some (or even almost all) of the work of
the modem to the main processor (CPU) chip of your computer (such as a
Pentium chip).  This requires special software (a modem driver) to do
the job.  Until late 1999, such software was released only for MS
Windows and wouldn't work with Linux.  Even worse was that the maker
of the modem kept the interface to the modem secret so that no one
could write a Linux driver for it (even though a few volunteers were
willing to write Linux drivers).  With few exceptions, this is still
true today (late 2000).  Also, there is no standard interface so that
different brands/models of software-modems need different drivers
(unless the different brands/models happen to use the same chipset
internally).
<P>A third name for a software modem (used by MS) is "driver-based
modem".  The conventional hardware-based modem (that works with Linux)
doesn't need a modem driver (but does use the Linux serial driver)
After about mid-1998 most new internal modems were winmodems and would
work only for MS Windows.
<P>
<H3>Linmodems</H3>

<P> Finally in late 1999 two software-based modems appeared that could
work under Linux and were sometimes called "linmodems".  Lucent
Technologies (LT) unofficially released a Linux binary-only code to
support its PCI modems.  PC-TEL (includes "Zoltrix") introduced a new
software-based modem for Linux.  There is a GPL'ed driver being
developed for the Modem Silicon Operation MD563X HaM chipset (nee
Ambient division of Cirrus Logic).  Will other companies follow these
leads and thus create "linmodems"?  For a list of modems which
work/don't_work under Linux see 
<A HREF="http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html">modem list</A>.
Links to "linmodem" drivers may also be found there.  A project to get
winmodems to work under Linux is at 
<A HREF="http://linmodems.org">http://linmodems.org</A>.
They also have a mailing list.  
<P>There is some effort underway at reverse-engineering with at least one
report of a winmodem that has been made to work under Linux (but not
yet with full functionality).  So by the time you read this there may
be more linmodems.
<P>For details of how to get some winmodems to work under Linux see the
Linmodem-HOWTO (and/or Winmodems-and-Linux-HOWTO which is not as well
written).  If code is made available to operate a "winmodem" under
Linux, then one may call it a "linmodem".  Is it still a "winmodem"?
Well, it's still a software-based modem.  The term "Winmodem" is also
a trademark for a certain model of "winmodem".  
<P>
<H3>Software-based modem types</H3>

<P> There are two basic types of software modems.  In one type the
software does almost all of the work.  The other is where the software
only does the "control" operations (which is everything except
processing the digital waveshapes --to be explained later).  Since the
hardware doesn't do the control it's called a "controllerless" modem.
The first type is an all-software modem (sometimes just called a
software modem).  
<P>For both of these types there must be analog hardware in the modem to
generate an electrical waveshape to send out the phone line.  It's
generated from a digital signal (which is sort of a "digital
waveshape").  It's something like the digital electronics creates a
lot of discrete points on graph paper and then the modem draws a
smooth curve thru them.  There must also be hardware to convert the
incoming waveshape to digital.  Then this digital waveshape must be
converted to a data byte stream.  The modem can't just send this data
byte stream to the PC but must first do decompression, error
correction, and convert from serial to the parallel bus of the
computer.
<P>The difference between the two types of software-based modems is where
these digital waveshapes are processed (generated and interpreted).
In the all-software modem this waveshape processing is done in the CPU
using a Host Signal Processor (HSP).  In the controllerless modem it's
done in the modem but all other digital work is done by the CPU (data
compression, AT-commands, etc.) For example the Rockwell HCF (Host
Controlled Family) does this.  If the software that does these tasks
could be ported to Linux and then there wouldn't be a major problem.
<P>
<H3>Is this modem a software modem?</H3>

<P> How do you determine if an internal modem will work under Linux?
First see if the name, description of it, or even the name of the MS
Windows driver for it indicates it's a software modem: HSP, HCF, HSF,
controllerless, host-controlled, host-based, and soft-...  modem.  If
it's one of these modem it will only work for the few cases (so far)
where a Linux driver is available.  
<P>If you don't know the model of the modem and you also have Windows on
your Linux PC, click on the "Modem" icon in the "Control Panel".  Then
check out the modem list (see 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-19.html#web_sites">Web Sites</A>.
If the above doesn't work (or isn't feasible), you can look at the
package it came in (or a manual) find the section on the package that
says something like "Minimum System Requirements" or just "System
Requirements".  It may be in fine print.  Read it closely.  
<P>If it requires a Pentium CPU, then almost all of it's work is done by
software and it's not likely to work under Linux.  If it requires a
486 CPU (or better) then it's likely a host-controlled modem that will
work only if there exists a Linux driver for it.  Saying that it only
works with Windows is also bad news. 
<P>Otherwise, it may work under Linux if it fails to state explicitly
that you must have Windows.  By saying it's "designed for Windows" it
may only mean that it fully supports Microsoft's plug-and-play which
is OK since Linux uses the same plug-and-play specs (but it's harder
to configure under Linux).  Being "designed for Windows" thus gives no
clue as to whether or not it will work under Linux.  You might check
the Website of the manufacturer or inquire via email.  Some
manufacturers are specifically stating that certain models work under
Linux.
<H3>Should I get a software modem?</H3>

<P> Only if you know there is a Linux driver for it that works OK.
Besides the problems of getting a driver, what are the pros and
cons of software modems?  Since the software modem uses the CPU to do
much of its work, the software modem requires less on-board
electronics and thus costs less.  At the same time, the CPU is heavily
loaded by the modem which may result in slower operation.  This is
especially true if other CPU-intensive tasks are running at the same
time the modem is being used.  Of course when you're not using the
software modem there is no degradation in performance at all.
<P>Is the cost savings worth it?  In some cases yes, especially if you
seldom use the modem and/or are not running any other CPU intensive tasks
when the modem is in use.  Thus there are cases where use of a
software modem is economically justified.  The savings in modem cost
could be used for a better CPU which would speed things up a little.
But the on-board electronics of a modem can do the job more
efficiently than a general purpose CPU (except that it's not efficient
when it's not in use).  So if you use the modem a lot it's probably
better to avoid software modems (and then you can use a less powerful
CPU :-).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="PCIm"></A> <A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 PCI Modems </A>
 </H2>

<P> A PCI modem card is one which inserts into a PCI-bus slot on the
motherboard of a PC.  While most PCI winmodems will not work under
Linux (no driver available) other PCI modems mostly work under Linux.
The Linux serial driver is being modified to support certain PCI modem
cards (but not winmodems).  If the Linux serial driver supports it
then the driver will set up the PnP configuration for you.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-6.html#PCI_ser_conf">PCI Bus Support Underway</A> If no special
support is in the Linux serial driver but it may still work OK but you
have to do some work to configure it.

<P> Such modems use DSP's (Digital Signal Processors) which are
programmed by driver which must be downloaded from the hard disk to
the DSP's memory just before using the modem.  Unfortunately, such
downloading is normally done by Dos/Windows programs (which doesn't
work for Linux).  But there has been substantial success in getting
some of these modems to work with Linux.  For example, there is a
Linux driver available to run a Lucent (DSP) modem.
<P>Ordinary modems that work fine with Linux (without needing a driver
for the modem) often have a DSP too (and may mention this on the
packaging), but the program that runs the DSP is stored inside the
modem.  This is not a "DSP modem" in the sense of this section.  An
example of a DSP modem is IBM's Aptiva MWAVE.
<P>If a DSP modem modem simulates a serial port, then it may be usable
with Linux provided you're willing/able to boot from DOS.  You must
have Dos/Windows on the same PC.   You first install the driver under
DOS (using DOS and not Window drivers).  Then start Dos/Windows and
start the driver for the modem so as to program the DSP.  Then without
turning off the computer, go into Linux.
<P>One may write a "batch" file (actually a script) to do this.  Here is
an example but you must modify it to suit your situation.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
rem mwave is a batch file supplied by the modem maker
call c:\mww\dll\mwave start
rem loadlin.exe is a DOS program that will boot Linux from DOS (See
rem Config-HOWTO).  
c:\linux\loadlin f:\vmlinuz root=/dev/hda3 ro
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<P>One may create an icon for the Window's desktop which points to such a
batch file and set the icon properties to "Run in MSDOS Mode".  Then
by clicking on this icon one sets up the modem and goes to Linux.
Another possible way to boot Linux from DOS is to press CTRL-ALT-DEL
and tell it to reboot (assuming that you have set things up so that
you can boot directly into Linux).  The modem remains on the same com
port (same IO address) that it used under DOS.
<P>The Newcom ifx modem needs a small kernel patch to work correctly
since its simulation of a serial port is non-standard.  The patch and
other info for using this modem with Linux is at 
<A HREF="http://maalox.pharmacy.ohio-state.edu/~ejolson/linux/newcom.html">http://maalox.pharmacy.ohio-state.edu/~ejolson/linux/newcom.html</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="rpi_"></A> Rockwell (RPI) Drivers </H3>

<P> Some older Rockwell chips need Rockwell RPI (Rockwell
Protocol Interface) drivers.  They can still be used with Linux even
though the driver software works only under MS Windows.  This is
because the MS Windows software which you don't have does only
compression and error correction.  If you are willing to operate the
modem without compression and error correction then it's feasible to
use it with Linux.  To do this you will need to disable RPI by sending
the modem (via the initialization string) a "RPI disable" command each
time you power on your modem.  On my modem this command was +H0.  Not
having data compression available makes it slower to get webpages but
is just as fast when downloading files that are already compressed.
