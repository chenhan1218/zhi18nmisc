<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Determining your mouse type.</A></H2>

<P>There are two separate but important characteristics you will need
to know about your mouse before you go on: what hardware interface
it uses and what mouse protocol it uses.  
<P>
<P>The hardware interface is the 
hardware aspect of the mouse, taking into account things like which i/o 
ports it uses and how to check if it is installed.  This is the part which
the kernel is concerned with so that it knows how to read data
from the mouse.  For serial mice users, this part of the story is easy since
their interface is always the serial port device drivers.
<P>The mouse protocol is the software aspect of the mouse.
Applications need to know the protocol to interpret the raw mouse
data they receive from the kernel device driver.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Hardware interfaces.</A>
</H2>

<P>The Linux kernel up to the 2.2 series supports four different kinds of busmouse
hardware interface : Inport (Microsoft), Logitech, PS/2 and ATI-XL.
<P>The 2.4 series of kernel also includes support for several new busmice including
an IBM PC110 digitizer pad and Apple Desktop mouse.  It also contains drivers
for USB mice which are sometimes discussed with busmice since they
fall outside the more common serial driver interface.
<P>There is no sure-fire way of determining your hardware interface.  For
those that have Windows 9x install, it sometimes helps to go to the 
Systems screen under the control panel and look for devices controlling
your mouse.  This screen will often tell you the interface type and 
what I/O ports and interrupts this hardware uses.
<P>
<H3>Inport mice.</H3>

<P>Inport mice include most of the old style Microsoft mice 
which are shaped like a bar of dove soap.  Inport mice
generally connect to an interface card which plugs into the bus
on your motherboard.  If the plug which connects your mouse cord
to the interface card is round, has 9 pins, and a notch in one
side you likely have an Inport mouse.
<P>ATI currently claims that all ATI VGA + Busmouse combo cards used the
Microsoft Inport hardware and thus owners of these cards should first
attempt using the Microsoft Busmouse driver.  
<P>The ATI-XL VGA+Busmouse
card technically is compatible with the Microsoft Inport mouse driver
but has slightly different provisioning for interrupts and therefore has
a specific driver for it.  Avoid this driver if possible since its not
supported very well.
<P>
<H3>Logitech mice.</H3>

<P>Logitech mice in general appear almost exactly the same as Inport
mice.  They too connect to an interface card via a 9 pin mini-din
connector.  Hopefully, it will have come in a Logitech box or
have ``Logitech'' printed on the connector card so that you can
tell it actually is a Logitech mouse.
<P>
<H3>PS/2 mice.</H3>

<P>The PS/2 mouse interface is not on an expansion card, the mouse is connected
to the PS/2 port on the keyboard controller.  This is sometimes located on
the keyboard or more often as a extra port somehow connected directly
to the computer case.
<P>A PS/2 port uses a 6-pin mini DIN connector, similar to
the keyboard connector.  Many laptops also use this kind of
interface to their trackballs or touchpads; in this case the mouse is
internally connected to the PS/2 port and needs no connector.
<P>
<H3>ATI combo video/mice.</H3>

<P>ATI-XL mice are a variant of Inport mice, with some slight
differences in interrupt setup.  They come on the ATI-XL combined 
video adaptor/mouse
card.  Unless you know you have an ATI-XL card (and thus an ATI-XL
mouse), you probably don't have one of these. It is possible for
ATI-XL mice to use either the ATI-XL or Inport kernel drivers,
although the ATI-XL driver should give better results.
<P>There is also an older ATI video adaptor/mouse card called either ATI
VGA1024 or ATI VGA Wonder.  These cards are setup the same as the
ATI-XL but use the Logitech mouse protocol.  For these mice the hardware
drivers are setup the same as for the ATI-XL but you setup the software 
the same as the Logitech mice.
<P>
<H3>IBM PC110 palmtop digitizer.</H3>

<P>The IBM PC110 palmtop contains a digitizer pad that can be used to emulate
a mouse using the PS/2 mouse protocol.  In this case, you set up the hardware
interface using the IBM PC110 device driver and setup software as you would
a PS/2 mouse.
<P>
<H3>Apple Desktop Mouse</H3>

<P>This bus mouse is common on Macintoshes and uses a 4 pin connector.
The hardware is controled by the kernel but application software will need
to be aware of its unique mouse protocol.  I am currently unaware of
what protocols this mouse uses.
<P>
<H3>Hybrid Mice</H3>

<P>The period of time that busmouse were popular, the hardware companies were
experementing alot and cross-licensing each others designs.  Therefore, you
could have a ATI mouse that uses the Logitech hardware interface or a Logitech
that uses the Inport interface.  If you know you have a busmouse but can't
get it working with the standard interface/protocol setups, try experementing
by using different interface device drivers with different mouse protocols.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Mouse protocols.</A>
</H2>

<P>The PC world is full of different and conflicting mouse protocols.
Fortunately, the choice for bus mice is considerable smaller than
that for serial mice.  Most Inport, Logitech and ATI-XL mice use
the ``BusMouse'' protocol, although there are some ancient 
Logitech mice which use the ``MouseSystems'' protocol, and 
some even older Microsoft mice which use the ''Logitech'' protocol. 
PS/2 mice will always use the ``PS/2'' protocol.
