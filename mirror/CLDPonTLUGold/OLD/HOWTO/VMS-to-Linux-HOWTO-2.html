<P>This is what you absolutely need to know before logging in the first
time. Relax, it's not much.

<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Under VMS filenames are in the form <CODE>filename.extension;version</CODE>.
Under Linux, the version number doesn't exist (big limitation, but see
Section 
<A HREF="VMS-to-Linux-HOWTO-10.html#Numbered Backups Under Linux">Numbered Backups Under Linux</A>); the filename
has normally a limit of 255 characters and can have as many dots as you
like. Example of filename: <CODE>This.is_a_FILEname.txt</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> Linux distinguishes between upper case and lower case characters: 
<CODE>FILENAME.txt</CODE> and <CODE>filename.txt</CODE> are two different files; 
<CODE>ls</CODE> is a command, <CODE>LS</CODE> is not.
</LI>
<LI> A filename starting with a dot is a `hidden' file (that is, 
it won't normally show up in dir listings), while filenames ending with a 
tilde '<CODE>~</CODE>' represent backup files.

</LI>
</UL>
<P>Now, a table to sum up how to translate commands from VMS to Linux:

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Directories</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Within the same node and device, directories names under VMS are in
the form <CODE>[top.dir.subdir]</CODE>; under Linux, <CODE>/top/dir/subdir/</CODE>. On
the top of the directory tree lies the so--called `root directory' called
<CODE>/</CODE>; underneath there are other directories like <CODE>/bin</CODE>,
<CODE>/usr</CODE>, <CODE>/tmp</CODE>, <CODE>/etc</CODE>, and others.
</LI>
<LI> The directory <CODE>/home</CODE> contains the so--called users' `home
directories': e.g. <CODE>/home/guido</CODE>, <CODE>/home/warner</CODE>, and so on.
When a user logs in, they start working in their home dir; it's the
equivalent of <CODE>SYS$LOGIN</CODE>. There's a shortcut for the home
directory: the tilde '<CODE>~</CODE>'. So, <CODE>cd ~/tmp</CODE> is the same
as, say, <CODE>cd /home/guido/tmp</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> Directory names follow the same rules as file names. Furthermore,
each directory has two special entries: one is <CODE>.</CODE> and refers to the
directory itself (like <CODE>[]</CODE>), and <CODE>..</CODE> that refers to the parent
directory (like <CODE>[-]</CODE>).

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Programs</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Commands, compiled programs, and shell scripts (VMS' `command 
files') don't have sort of mandatory extensions like <CODE>.EXE</CODE> or <CODE>.COM</CODE> 
and can be called whatever you like. Executable files are marked by an 
asterisk '<CODE>*</CODE>' when you issue <CODE>ls -F</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> To run an executable file, just type its name (no <CODE>RUN
PROGRAM.EXE</CODE> or <CODE>@COMMAND</CODE>). Caveat: it's essential that the file be
located in a directory included in the <EM>path of executables</EM>, which is a
list of directories. Typically, the path includes dirs like <CODE>/bin</CODE>,
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE>, <CODE>/usr/X11R6/bin</CODE>, and others. If you write your
own programs, put them in a directory you have included in the path (see how
in Section 
<A HREF="VMS-to-Linux-HOWTO-9.html#Configuring">Configuring</A>). As an alternative,
you may run a program specifying its complete path: e.g.,
<CODE>/home/guido/data/myprog</CODE>; or <CODE>./myprog</CODE>, if the current
directory isn't in the path.
</LI>
<LI> Command switches are obtained with <CODE>/OPTION=</CODE> under VMS, and
with <CODE>-switch</CODE> or <CODE>--switch</CODE> under Linux, where <CODE>switch</CODE> is a
letter, more letters combined, or a word. In particular, the switch <CODE>-R</CODE>
(recursive) of many Linux commands performs the same action as <CODE>[...]</CODE>
under VMS;
</LI>
<LI> You can issue several commands on the command line:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ command1 ; command2 ; ... ; commandn
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI> Most of the flexibility of Linux comes from two features awkwardly
implemented or missing in VMS: I/O redirection and piping. (I have been told
that recent versions of DCL support redirection and piping, but I don't have
that version.) Redirection is a side feature under VMS (remember
the switch <CODE>/OUTPUT=</CODE> of many commands), or a fastidious process,
like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ DEFINE /USER SYS$OUTPUT OUT 
$ DEFINE /USER SYS$INPUT IN
$ RUN PROG
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


which has the simple Linux (UNIX) equivalent:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ prog &lt; in > out
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


Piping is not readily available under VMS, but has a key role under UNIX. A
typical example:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ myprog &lt; datafile | filter_1 | filter_2 >> result.dat 2> errors.log &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


which means: the program <CODE>myprog</CODE> gets its input from the file
<CODE>datafile</CODE> (via <CODE>&lt;</CODE>), its output is piped (via <CODE>|</CODE>) to
the program <CODE>filter_1</CODE> that takes it as input and processes it, the
resulting output is piped again to <CODE>filter_2</CODE> for further processing, the
final output is appended (via <CODE>&gt;&gt;</CODE>) to the file <CODE>result.dat</CODE>,
and error messages are redirected (via <CODE>2&gt;</CODE>) onto the file
<CODE>errors.log</CODE>. All this in background (<CODE>&amp;</CODE> at the end of the
command line). More about this in Section 
<A HREF="VMS-to-Linux-HOWTO-11.html#Examples">Examples</A>.
</LI>
</UL>
 
<P>For multitasking, `queues', and the like, see Section 
<A HREF="VMS-to-Linux-HOWTO-8.html#Advanced Topics">Advanced Topics</A>.

</H2>

<P>
<P>Now you are ready to try Linux out. Enter your login name and password
<EM>exactly</EM> as they are. For example, if your login name and password are
<CODE>john</CODE> and <CODE>My_PassWd</CODE>, <EM>don't</EM> type <CODE>John</CODE> or <CODE>my_passwd</CODE>.
Remember, UNIX distinguishes between capital and small letters.
<P>Once you've logged in, you'll see a prompt; chances are it'll be something
like <CODE>machinename:$</CODE>. If you want to change the prompt or make
some programs start automatically, you'll have to edit a `hidden' file
called <CODE>.profile</CODE> or <CODE>.bash_profile</CODE> (see example in Section 
<A HREF="VMS-to-Linux-HOWTO-9.html#Configuring">Configuring</A>). This is the equivalent of
<CODE>LOGIN.COM</CODE>.
<P>Pressing ALT--F1, ALT--F2, ... ALT--F6 switches between `virtual consoles'. 
When one VC is busy with a full--screen application, you can flip over to 
another and continue to work. Try and log in to another VC.
<P>Now you may want to start X Window System (from now on, X). X is a graphic
environment very similar to DECWindows---actually, the latter derives from
the former. Type the command <CODE>startx</CODE> and wait a few seconds; most likely
you'll see an open <CODE>xterm</CODE> or equivalent terminal emulator, and possibly
a button bar. (It depends on how your sysadm configured your Linux box.)
Click on the desktop (try both mouse buttons) to see a menu.
<P>While in X, to access the text mode (`console') sessions press
CTRL--ALT--F1 ... CTRL--ALT--F6. Try it. When in console, go back to X 
pressing ALT--F7. To quit X, follow the menu instructions or press 
CTRL--ALT--BS.
<P>Type the following command to list your home dir contents, including the 
hidden files:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ls -al
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Press SHIFT--PAG UP to back-scroll. Now get help about the <CODE>ls</CODE> command 
typing:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ man ls
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>pressing 'q' to exit. To end the tour, type <CODE>exit</CODE> to quit your session.
If now you want to turn off your PC, press CTRL--ALT--DEL and wait a few
seconds (<EM>never</EM> switch off the PC while in Linux! You could damage the
filesystem.)
<P>If you think you're ready to work, go ahead, but if I were you I'd jump
