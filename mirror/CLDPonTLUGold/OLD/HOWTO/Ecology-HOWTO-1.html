<P>Life is the first gift, love is the second, and understanding is the third. --

<P>Though computers can be seen as part of environmental pollution, there are also ways to use computers in a more reasonable manner to help protect the environment. So I have just started to collect some means to do so with Linux.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Objectives</A>
</H2>

<P>Some objectives of the howto:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Reduction in power consumption.</LI>
<LI>Reduction in consumables like paper and inks.</LI>
<LI>Reduction in waste by reusing older components or keeping them in service longer.</LI>
<LI>Reduction in toxic waste such as used batteries.</LI>
<LI>Use of Linux in environmental education and research.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Caveats</A>
</H2>

<P>Some of the recommendations in this text are discussed controversial, for instance: powering down a device, when it's not in use. This may save power, but not under all circumstances. Also it may have other additional ecological costs, e.g. the life time of the device can be shortened.
<P>I don't have enough technological knowledge to make a decision between these alternatives. Also some alternatives might be rated differently by different persons. So finally the decision what to choose is up to you. Anyway if you have better alternatives please let me know.
