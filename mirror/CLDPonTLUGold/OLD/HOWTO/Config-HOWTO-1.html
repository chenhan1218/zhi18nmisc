<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Why This HOWTO</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Current distributions are approaching perfection, but some fine-tuning is
still needed. Many new users are intimidated by the apparent complexity of a
Linux system, and as a result I note that the same questions crop up on
c.o.l.setup over and over again. To try and remedy this situation, and for
my own convenience, I wrote a to--do list that eventually became this HOWTO.
Here you will find configuration tips and examples for the most common
applications, programs, and services, which should save you a fair amount of
time and work.
<P>I realise that this HOWTO is quite RedHat-centric. Currently, I only have
access to Red Hat and Mandrake machines, kernels ranging from 2.0.36 to
2.2.15; so don't take any of my tips as gospel if you have other
distributions. Previous versions of this HOWTO provided some information for
SuSE, Debian and Caldera; but as I no longer have access to those machines,
I can't keep the details up-to-date. No information is better that
inaccurate information, so it's up to you to to adapt my tips to your
distribution.
<P>This HOWTO can't, and is not meant to, replace others. Reading docs and
HOWTOs always pays, so you're strongly advised to do so if you want to know
more. Also, no spoon--feeding here: if you realise you don't understand
something, please refer to the relevant HOWTO. Let me remind you that the
right place for seeking help with Linux configuration
is Usenet, i.e. 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.setup">news:comp.os.linux.setup</A>. <EM>Please</EM>,
don't seek help from me because I'm quite overloaded.
<P>The official place for this document, which also hosts all other HOWTOs I
refer to and some translations, is 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org">http://www.linuxdoc.org</A>.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What We Will Be Configuring</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There can be endless hardware configurations for a PC, but in my experience
one is quite common: a PC fitted with a large HD split into three partitions
(one for DOS/Windows, one for Linux, one for the swap), sound card, modem,
CD--ROM drive, printer, mouse. A parallel port Zip Drive is also very
common. This machine is possibly part of a mixed Windows-Linux network,
where it acts as server.
<P>This is the hardware I'll assume you want to configure, but it's easy to
adapt the following tips to different configurations. It's implicitly
assumed that you'll be root when editing/fixing/hacking.
<P>And now, lads, sleeves up.
