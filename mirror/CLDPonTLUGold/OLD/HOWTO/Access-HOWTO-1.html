<P>The aim of this document is to serve as an introduction to the
technologies which are available to make Linux usable by people who,
through some disability would otherwise have problems with it.  In
other words the target groups of the technologies are, the blind, the
partially sighted, deaf and the physically disabled.  As any other
technologies or pieces of information are discovered they will be
added.
<P>
<P>The information here not just for these people (although that is
probably the main aim) but also to allow developers of Linux to become
aware of the difficulties involved here.  Possibly the biggest
problem is that, right now, very few of the developers of Linux are
aware of the issues and various simple ways to make life simpler for
implementors of these systems.  This has, however, changed noticeably
since the introduction of this document, and at least to a small
extent because of this document, but also to a large extent due to the
work of some dedicated developers, many of whom are mentioned in the
document's Acknowledgements.
<P>
<P>Please send any comments or extra information or offers of
assistance to 
<A HREF="mailto:access-howto@ed.ac.uk">&lt;access-howto@ed.ac.uk&gt;</A> This address might become a
mailing list in future, or be automatically handed over to a future
maintainer of the HOWTO, so please don't use it for personal email.
<P>I don't have time to follow developments in all areas.  I probably
won't even read a mail until I have time to update this document.
It's still gratefully received.  If a mail is sent to the blind-list
or the access-list, I <I>will</I> eventually read it and put any useful
information into the document.  Otherwise, please send a copy of
anything interesting to the above email address.
<P>
<P>Normal mail can be sent to

is most likely to lead to an appropriate response.
