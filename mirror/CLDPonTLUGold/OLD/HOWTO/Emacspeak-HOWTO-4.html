<P>
<P>This arrangement again requires a DOS machine with a speech
synthesizer and a terminal emulator program.  However, instead of
dialing up a remote computer, it is used as a terminal to a local
computer running Linux.  To get to this point, you need to install
Linux on a machine.  You may be able to prevail on a knowledgeable
friend to help you with this.  However, it is also possible to
install it yourself with speech feedback for almost the whole
procedure.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Installing Linux</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>First, some background.  Even the simplest Unix system requires a
program called the kernel and a root file system.  The kernel has all
the device drivers and resource management functions.  One normally
thinks of a "file system" as residing on a hard disk or floppy disk,
but during an installation it is usually in ram.  Linux is normally
installed by writing a kernel image to a floppy disk, called the "boot
floppy", configuring it to reserve a section of RAM for a ramdisk,
then filling that ramdisk with data from a second floppy disk, called
the "root floppy".  As soon as both floppies have been read in, the
user can log in as "root" and complete the installation.  The sighted
user logs in on the "system console", that is, the computer's own
keyboard and video display.  However, remember that Unix has been a
multiprocessing operating system from the very beginning.  Even this
very primitive Unix system, running out of a small ramdisk, also
supports logins from a terminal connected to a serial port.  This is
what a blind user can use.
<P>To connect the two computers, you can use a "null modem", a
serial cable that connects ground to ground, and transmit on each end
to receive on the other.  The cable that comes with the DOS
application LapLink will work fine.  It is particularly
handy, in fact, because it has both a 9 pin and a 25 pin connector on
each end.  If you want to check a cable or have one made, here are the
required connections:
<P>For two 9 pin connectors, connect pin 2 (receive data) to pin
3, pin 3 (transmit data) to pin 2, and pin 5 (signal ground) to pin 5.
<P>For two 25 pin connectors, connect pin 2 (receive data) to pin
3, pin 3 (transmit data) to pin 2, and pin 7 (signal ground) to pin 7.
<P>For a 9 pin connector (first) to a 25 pin connector (second),
connect pin 2 (receive data) to pin 2 (transmit data), pin 3 (transmit
data) to pin 3 (receive data), and pin 5 (signal ground) to pin 7
(signal ground).
<P>You may have noted that I have included no connections for the
"handshaking" signals.  During login, the serial port is handled by
the program <CODE>agetty</CODE>.  Recent versions of this program accept a -L
switch which tells it not to expect modem control signals.  The
version in Slackware 3.0 does, but the one on the 3.0 (and earlier)
installation root disks does not.  However, Pat Volkerding has assured
me that the root disks in the next release of Slackware will have the
updated version of <CODE>agetty</CODE>.  It is also possible to use the
earlier root disks [
<A HREF="Emacspeak-HOWTO-6.html#slackware3.0">Emacspeak with Earlier Slackware Releases</A>].
<P>Consult the documentation on your CDROM, or downloaded from an FTP
site, and choose a boot disk with the proper kernel features for your
hardware (IDE or SCSI, CDROM driver, etc.).  I have the InfoMagic
September 1996 "Developer's Resource" set of six CDROMs.  Slackware
3.1 is on disk 1 of that set, mostly in the two directories slackwar
and slakware.  (Note the difference in spelling.  You will access them
in alphabetical order: first slackwar, then slakware.)
<P>Documentation on the boot floppies is in
\bootdsks.144\which.one.  A copy of the DOS program for
writing boot images to a floppy, rawrite.exe, is in the same
directory.  Assuming the CDROM is the M drive under DOS, one might
use these commands to write to a floppy disk in the A drive:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        C>m:
        M>cd \bootdsks.144
        M>rawrite scsinet.s a:
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similarly, to write the "text" root disk:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        C>m:
        M>cd \rootdsks
        M>rawrite text.gz a:
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you install from floppies, you should also copy the Emacspeak
package onto a floppy with a command like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        C>copy m:\contrib\emacspea.tgz a:
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For the actual installation, proceed as follows: Use the null modem to
connect the computer running DOS and equipped with speech output
(which I will call the "DOS machine") to the computer into which you
want to install Linux (the "Linux machine").
<P>Boot the DOS machine, and start your terminal emulation program.  Set
it up for 9600 baud, no parity, eight data bits, 1 stop bit.
<P>On the Linux machine, insert the "boot" disk and boot
(power up, cntl-alt-del, or hit the reset switch).  It should read the
disk for five seconds or so, beep, and stop with the following text:
<P>(Note: in the following, the large blocks of text quoted from the
installation disks are preceded by "-- begin quote" and followed by

Welcome to the Slackware96 Linux (v. 3.1.0) bootkernel disk!

If you have any extra parameters to pass to the kernel, enter them at
the prompt below after one of the valid configuration names (ramdisk,
mount, drive2)

Here are some examples (and more can be found in the BOOTING file):

  ramdisk hd=cyl,hds,secs    (Where "cyl", "hds", and "secs" are the
                             number of cylinders, sectors, and heads
                             on the drive.  Most machines won't need
                             this.)

In a pinch, you can boot your system with a command like:
  mount root=/dev/hda1

On machines with low memory, you can use mount root=/dev/fd1 or mount
root=/dev/fd0 to install without a ramdisk.  See LOWMEM.TXT for
details.

If you would rather load the root/install disk from your second
floppy drive: drive2 (or even this: ramdisk root=/dev/fd1)

DON'T SWITCH ANY DISKS YET!  This prompt is just for entering extra
parameters.  If you don't need to enter any parameters, hit ENTER to
continue.

boot:
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
-- end quote
</PRE>
<P>I have almost always been able to just hit "enter" at this point.
<P>After your entry, the Linux machine should read the floppy for another
twenty seconds or so, then boot the kernel.  The first thing it prints
is "Loading ramdisk...", which is somewhat misleading.  In this case,
"ramdisk" is actually the name of the kernel configuration.
<P>Each device driver in the kernel displays a line or two.  The
particular disk I'm using (the "bare.i" bootdisk) displays more than
one screen's worth.  It is possible to type shift-page up to scroll
the text back.  On my machine, the boot messages are as follows:

Welcome to the Slackware Linux installation disk ,version 3.1.0-text!
### READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW CAREFULLY! ###

You will need one or more partitions of type "Linux native"
prepared. It is also recommended that you create a swap partition
(type "Linux swap") prior to installation. Most users can use the
Linux "fdisk" utility to create and tag the types of all these
partitions. OS/2 Boot Manager users, however, should create their
Linux partitions with OS/2 "fdisk", add the bootable (root) partition
to the Boot Manager menu, and then use the Linux "fdisk" to tag the
partitions as type "Linux native".

If you have 4 megabytes or less of RAM, you MUST ACTIVATE a swap
partition before running setup. After making the partition with fdisk,
use:

mkswap /dev/&lt;partition> &lt;number of blocks> ; swapon /dev/&lt;partition>

Once you have prepared the disk partitions for Linux, type "setup" to
begin the installation process.

You may now login as "root".

slackware login:
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
-- end quote
</PRE>
<P>The program that prints the login prompt is called <CODE>agetty</CODE>.  The
Slackware 3.1 root disks are set up to allow logins only from the
computer's own keyboard.  You will have to reconfigure it to also
allow logins from a serial port.  This requires typing four lines on
the Linux machine keyboard, with no voice feedback.  If you realize
you have made a mistake before hitting the carriage return, you can
erase it with the backspace key.  You can also discard what you have
typed on a line with control-C.  Here is what you type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root
cat >>/etc/inittab
s1:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0
control-D
init q
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I will repeat that with explanations of what is going on.
<P>First, type "root" and a single carriage return
to log in (no password is needed).  Next, you need to append one line
to <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>.  Type the following two lines:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cat >>/etc/inittab
s1:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Finish each line with the "enter" key.  Then type a control-D, which
signals end of file to a Unix program.  (Note: In the second line, the
next to last character is an upper case "S".  Everything else is in
lower case.)  This adds a line to the configuration file
of the program <CODE>init</CODE>, to instruct it to use <CODE>agetty</CODE> to watch
for logins on the first serial port on the Linux machine, called
"COM1" under DOS, or "/dev/ttyS0" under Linux.  To use the second port
instead, change the last item on the above line to "ttyS1".
<P>Then type
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
init q
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>which causes <CODE>init</CODE> to reread <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>.  At
this point the DOS machine should display the login prompt (the third
of the blocks of text quoted above).  On the DOS machine, type
<CODE>root</CODE>, and finish the installation.  (The next thing you should do
is create and enable a swap partition.)
<P>If you don't get the Slackware installation disk prompt, try the
following:
<UL>
<LI> Type a single carriage return on the DOS machine.  </LI>
<LI> Recheck the terminal setup (9600 baud, no parity, eight data
bits, 1 stop bit)</LI>
<LI> Disconnect the null modem from the DOS machine.  In its place,
connect a modem which supports the Hayes "AT" commands.  Type <CODE>AT</CODE> and
a carriage return.  You should get a reply of "OK" from the modem.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Once you get the above prompt on the DOS machine, you may type
<CODE>root</CODE> and a carriage return to log in, and complete the
installation like any other user.  Of course, you must remember to
include these packages: emacs, tcl, and tclX.
<P>The installation script will offer to prepare a boot floppy.  You
should do this, since it is the most foolproof way to boot Linux.  You
will probably also want to install <CODE>lilo</CODE> (which is an abbreviation
for "Linux loader") and/or <CODE>loadlin</CODE> (which is an abbreviation for
"load Linux").  The installation script can install lilo.  Loadlin is
a DOS program that will let you boot from DOS to Linux.  Install it on
a DOS partition, and copy a compressed kernel file (usually named
<CODE>zImage</CODE>) to the same partition.  While running DOS, you may boot
Linux with a command like <CODE>loadlin zimage root=/dev/hda3 ro/</CODE>.
(I have assumed here that the kernel image is in the same directory as
the loadlin program.  You may find it more convenient to store kernel
images in subdirectories named for the kernel version.)
<P>After the Slackware setup script finishes the main installation, it
will tell you to restart by pressing cntl-alt-del.  Before doing that,
you should install emacspeak.  It can be found with the other
"contributed" software.  In the InfoMagic set, it is in
slackwar/contrib.  Assuming you are installing Linux directly from a
CDROM, the setup script will mount the CDROM under /CDROM, and you may
install emacspeak with the following command:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        # installpkg /CDROM/slackwar/contrib/emacspeak.tgz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you install from floppies, insert the floppy you made earlier and
type this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        # mount -tmsdos /dev/fd0 /floppy
        # cp /floppy/emacspea.tgz /tmp/emacspeak.tgz
        # installpkg /tmp/emacspeak.tgz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You should not install the package directly off the floppy disk,
because the DOS filesystem will not allow the full filename, so the
installpkg program will think the package name is "emacspea" and will
store its records under that name.
<P>If you have a DoubleTalk or LiteTalk speech synthesizer, you should
also install the emacspeak-dt package.
<P>Reboot the Linux machine with the new boot floppy, with the
DOS machine still connected.  You should get a login prompt on the DOS
machine.  Celebrate!  After getting this system working, you need to
learn emacs (third option) and Unix system administration.
