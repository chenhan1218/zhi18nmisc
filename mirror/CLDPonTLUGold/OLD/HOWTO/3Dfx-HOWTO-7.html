<H2><A NAME="s7">7. FAQ: Glide? TexUS?</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 What is Glide anyway?</A>
</H2>

<P>Glide is a proprietary API plus drivers to access
3D graphics accelerator hardware based on chipsets
manufactured by 3Dfx. Glide has been developed
and implemented for DOS, Windows, and Macintosh, and
has been ported to Linux by Daryll Strauss.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 What is TexUS?</A>
</H2>

<P>In the distribution is a <CODE>libtexus.so</CODE>, which
is the 3Dfx Interactive Texture Utility Software.
It is an image processing libary and utility program
for preparing images for use with the 3Dfx
Interactive Glide library. Features of TexUS include
file format conversion, MIPmap creation, and support for
3Dfx Interactive Narrow Channel Compression
textures.
<P>The TexUS utility program <CODE>texus</CODE>
reads images in several popular formats (TGA, PPM,
RGT), generates MIPmaps, and writes the
images as 3Dfx Interactive textures files
(see e.g. alpha.3df, as found in the distribution)
or as an image file for inspection. For details
on the parameters for <CODE>texus</CODE>, and the
API, see the TexUS documentation.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Is Glide freeware?</A>
</H2>

<P>Nope. Glide is neither GPL'ed nor subject to any other
public license. See LICENSE in the distribution for any
details. Effectively, by downloading and using it, you
agree to the End User License Agreement (EULA) on the
3Dfx web site. Glide is provided as binary only,
and you should
neither use nor distribute any files but the ones released
to the public, if you have not signed an NDA. The Glide
distribution including the test program sources are
copyrighted by 3Dfx.
<P>The same is true for all the sources in the Glide
distribution. In the words of 3Dfx: These are not public
domain, but they can be freely distributed to
owners of 3Dfx products only.  No card, No code!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Where do I get Glide?</A>
</H2>

<P>The entire 3Dfx SDK is available for download off their
public web-site located at  
<A HREF="http://www.3dfx.com/software/download_glide.html">www.3dfx.com/software/download_glide.html</A>. Anything
else 3Dfx publicly released by 3Dfx is nearby on
their website, too. 
<P>There is also an FTP site, 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.3dfx.com/">ftp.3dfx.com</A>. The FTP has a longer timeout, and some
of the larger files have been broken into 3 files
(approx. 3MB each). 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Is the Glide source available?</A>
</H2>

<P>Nope. The Glide source is made available only based
on a special agreement and NDA with 3Dfx.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Is Linux Glide supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>Currently, Linux Glide is unsupported. Basically,
it is provided under the same disclaimers
as the 3Dfx GL DLL (see below).
<P>However, 3Dfx definitely wants to provide as much
support as possible, and is in the process of
setting up some prerequisites. For the time being,
you will have to rely on the 3Dfx newsgroup (see
below). 
<P>In addition, the Quantum3D web page claims that
Linux support (for Obsidian) is planned for both Intel
and AXP architecture systems in 2H97.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7 Where could I post Glide questions?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are newsgroups currently available only on
the NNTP server 
<A HREF="news://news.3dfx.com/">news.3dfx.com</A> run by 3Dfx.
This USENET groups are dedicated to
3Dfx and Glide in general, and will mainly provide
assistance for DOS, Win95, and NT. The current
list includes:
<HR>
<PRE>
3dfx.events
3dfx.games.glquake
3dfx.glide
3dfx.glide.linux
3dfx.products
3dfx.test
</PRE>
<HR>

and the <CODE>3dfx.oem.products.*</CODE> group for
specific boards, eg. <CODE>3dfx.oem.products.quantum3d.obsidian</CODE>.
Please use 
<A HREF="news://news.3dfx.com/3dfx.glide.linux">news.3dfx.com/3dfx.glide.linux</A> for all
Lnux Glide related questions.
<P>A mailing list dedicated to Linux Glide is in preparation
for 1Q98. Send mail to 
<A HREF="mailto:majordomo@gamers.org">majordomo@gamers.org</A>, no subject,
body of the message <CODE>info linux-3dfx</CODE> to get
information about the posting guidelines, the
hypermail archive and how
to subscribe to the list or the digest.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.8">7.8 Where to send bug reports?</A>
</H2>

<P>Currently, you should rely on the newsgroup (see above),
that is
<A HREF="news://news.3dfx.com/3dfx.glide.linux">news.3dfx.com/3dfx.glide.linux</A>.
There is no official support e-mail set up yet.
For questions not specific to Linux Glide, make sure
to use the other newsgroups.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.9">7.9 Who is maintaining it?</A>
</H2>

<P>3Dfx will appoint an official maintainer soon.
Currently, inofficial maintainer of the Linux
Glide port is Daryll Strauss. Please post
bug reports in the newsgroup (above). If you
are confident that you found a bug not previously
reported, please mail to Daryll at
<A HREF="mailto:daryll@harlot.rb.ca.us">daryll@harlot.rb.ca.us</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.10">7.10 How can I contribute to Linux Glide?</A>
</H2>

<P>You could submit precise bug reports. Providing sample
programs to be included in the distribution is another
possibility. A major contribution would be adding
code to the Glide based Mesa Voodoo driver source. 
See section on Mesa Voodoo below.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.11">7.11 Do I have to use Glide?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes. As of now, there is no other Voodoo Graphics (tm) driver available
for Linux. At the lowest level, Glide is the only interface
that talks directly to the hardware. However, you
can write OpenGL code without knowing anything about Glide,
and use Mesa with the Glide based Mesa Voodoo driver.
It helps to be aware of the involvement of Glide for
recognizing driver limitations and bugs, though.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.12">7.12 Should I program using the Glide API?</A>
</H2>

<P>That depends on the application you are heading for.
Glide is a proprietary API that is partly similar
to OpenGL or Mesa, partly contains features 
only available as EXTensions to some OpenGL
implementations, and partly contains features not
available anywhere but within Glide.
<P>If you want to use the OpenGL API, you will need
Mesa (see below).
Mesa, namely the Mesa Voodoo driver, offers an
API resembling the well documented and widely
used OpenGL API. However, the Mesa Voodoo driver
is in early alpha, and you will have to accept
performance losses and lack of support for some
features.
<P>In summary, the decision is up to you - if you
are heading for maximum performance while
accepting potential problems with porting to
non-3Dfx hardware, Glide is not a bad
choice. If you care about maintenance, OpenGL
might be the best bet in the long run.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.13">7.13 What is the Glide current version?</A>
</H2>

<P>The current version of Linux Glide is 2.4.
The next version will probably be identical to
the current version for DOS/Windows, which is 2.4.3,
which comes in two distributions. Right now, various
parts of Glide are different for Voodoo Rush (tm) (VR)
and Voodoo Graphics (tm) (VG) boards. Thus you have to pick up
separate distributions (under Windows) for VR and VG.
The same will be true for Linux. There will possibly
be another chunk of code and another distribution for 
Voodoo 2 (tm) (V2) boards.
<P>There is also a Glide 3.0 in preparation that
will extend the API for use of triangle fans
and triangle strips, and provide better state
change optimization. Support for fans and strips
will in some situations significantly reduce the
amount of data sent ber triangle, and the
Mesa driver will benefit from this, as
the OpenGL API has separate modes for this. For
a detailed explanation on this see e.g. the
OpenGL documentation.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.14">7.14 Does it support multiple Texelfx already?</A>
</H2>

<P>Multiple Texelfx/TMU's can be used for single pass
trilinear mipmapping for improvement image
quality without performance penalty in current
Linux Glide already. You will need a board
with two Texelfx (that is, one of the appropriate
Quantum3D Obsidian boards). The application needs
to specify the use of both Texelfx accordingly,
it does not happen automatically.
<P>Note that because most applications are implemented for
consumer boards with a single Texelfx, they might not
query the presence of a second Texelfx, and thus not
use it. This is not a flaw of Glide but of the
application.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.15">7.15 Is Linux Glide identical to DOS/Windows Glide?</A>
</H2>

<P>The publicly available version of Linux Glide should
be identical to the respective DOS/Windows versions.
Delays in releasing the Linux port of newer DOS/Windows
releases are possible.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.16">7.16 Where to I get information on Glide?</A>
</H2>

<P>There is exhaustive information available from
3Dfx. You could download it from their home
page at
<A HREF="http://www.3dfx.com/software/download_glide.html">www.3dfx.com/software/download_glide.html</A>.
These are for free, presuming you bought a 3Dfx
hardware based board. Please read the licensing regulations.
<P>Basically, you should look for some of the following:
<UL>
<LI><EM>Glide Release Notes</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>Glide Programming Guide</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>Glide Reference Manual</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>Glide Porting Guide</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>TexUs Texture Utility Software</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>ATB Release Notes</EM></LI>
<LI><EM>Installing and Using the Obsidian</EM></LI>
</UL>

These are available as Microsoft Word documents, and
part of the Windows Glide distribution, i.e. 
the self-extracting archive file. Postscript copies
for separate download should be available at
<A HREF="http://www.3dfx.com/software/download_glide.html">www.3dfx.com</A> as well. Note that the release
numbers are not always in sync with those of Glide.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.17">7.17 Where to get some Glide demos?</A>
</H2>

<P>You will find demo sources for Glide within the
distribution (test programs), and on the 3Dfx home
page. The problem with the latter is that some require
ATB. To port these demos to Linux, the event handling
has to be completely rewritten.
<P>In addition, you might find useful some of the OpenGL
demo sources accompanying Mesa and GLUT. While
the Glide API is different from the OpenGL API,
they target the same hardware rendering pipeline.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.18">7.18 What is ATB?</A>
</H2>

<P>Some of the 3Dfx demo programs for Glide depend
not only on Glide but also on 3Dfx's proprietary Arcade
Toolbox (ATB), which is available for DOS and Win32,
but has not been ported for Linux. If you are a devleoper,
the sources are available within the Total Immersion
program, so porting ATB to Linux would be possible.
