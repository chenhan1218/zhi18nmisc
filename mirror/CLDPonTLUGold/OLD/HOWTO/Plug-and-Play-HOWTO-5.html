<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Introduction to Dealing with PnP Cards</A>
</H2>

<P> Today most all new internal boards (cards) are Plug-and-Play
(PnP).  There are 5 different methods listed below to cope with PnP
(but some may not be feasible in your situation).  If the device
driver configures it, then you don't need to do anything.  If the BIOS
configures it, you hope that the driver can find out what the BIOS did
(you may need to tell it this in a configuration file or the like).

</UL>
<P>Any of the above will set the bus-resources in the hardware but only
the first one tells the driver what has been done.  How the driver gets
informed depends on the driver.  You may need to do something to
inform it.  See 
<A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO-6.html#tell_driver_config">Tell the Driver the Configuration</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="dev_d_conf"></A> <A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Device Driver Configures </A>
</H2>

<P> Many device drivers (with the help of code provided by the kernel)
will use PnP methods to set the bus-resources in the hardware but only
for the device that they control.  Since the driver has done the
configuring, it obviously knows the configuration and there is no need
for you to tell it this info.  This is obviously the easiest way to do
it since you don't have to do anything if the driver does it all.
<P>For PCI devices, most drivers will configure PnP but for ISA devices
it's problematical.  This is because PCI has always been inherently
PnP even though PnP was called "PCI Configuration" (and still is).
For ISA, the kernel provided no functions for PnP configuring until
version 2.4.  So if you have a late version of both the kernel and the
driver then the driver is more likely to configure PnP
(bus-resources).  But if you have older versions (or if the driver
maintainer didn't add PnP to it) then the driver will likely not
configure PnP.
<P>Unfortunately, a driver may grab bus-resources that are needed by other
devices (but not yet allocated to them by the kernel).  Thus a true
PnP Linux kernel would be better where the kernel did the allocation
after all requests were in.  See 
<A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO-3.html#how_linux_pnps">How Linux Does PnP</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="bios_conf"></A> <A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 BIOS Configures PnP </A>
</H2>

<H3>Intro to Using the BIOS to Configure PnP</H3>

<P> If you have a PnP BIOS, it can configure the hardware.  This means
that your BIOS reads the resource requirements of all devices and
configures them (allocates bus-resources to them).  It is a substitute
for a PnP OS except that the BIOS doesn't match up the drivers with
their devices nor tell the drivers how it has done the configuring.
It should normally use the configuration it has stored in its
non-volatile memory (ESCD).  If it finds a new device or if there's a
conflict, the BIOS should make the necessary changes to the
configuration and may not use the same configuration as was in the
ESCD.
<P>Your BIOS must support such configuring and there have been cases
where it doesn't do it correctly or completely.  An advantage of using
the BIOS is that it's simple since in most cases there is nothing to
set up (except to tell the BIOS's CMOS menu it's not a PnP OS).  While
many device drivers will be able to automatically detect what the
BIOS has done, in some cases you may need to determine it (not always
easy).  See 
<A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO-7.html#current_config">What Is My Current Configuration?</A> Another possible advantage is that the BIOS does its
work before Linux starts so that all the bus-resources are ready to be
used (and found) by the device drivers that start up later.
<P>According to MS it's only optional (not required) that a PnP BIOS be
able to PnP-configure the devices (without help from MS Windows).  But
it seems that most of the ones made after 1996 ?? or so can do it.  We
should send them thank-you notes if they do it right.  They configure
both the PCI and ISA buses, but it has been claimed that some older
BIOSs can only do the PCI.  To try to find out more about your BIOS,
look on the Web.  Please don't ask me as I don't have data on this.
The details of the BIOS that you would like to know about may be hard
to find (or not available).  Some BIOSs may have minimal PnP
capabilities and seemingly expects the operating system to do it
right.  If this happens you'll either have to find another method or
try to set up the ESCD database if the BIOS has one.  See the next
section.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="escd_"></A> The BIOS's ESCD Database </H3>

<P> The BIOS maintains a non-volatile database containing a
PnP-configuration that it will try to use.  It's called the ESCD
(Extended System Configuration Data).  Again, the provision of ESCD is
optional but most PnP-BIOSs have it.  The ESCD not only stores the
resource-configuration of PnP devices but also stores configuration
information of non-PnP devices (and marks them as such) so as to avoid
conflicts.  The ESCD data is usually saved on a chip and remains
intact when the power is off, but sometimes it's kept on a hard-drive??  
<P>The ESCD is intended to hold the last used configuration, but if you
use a program such as Linux's isapnp or pci utilities (which doesn't
update the ESCD) then the ESCD will not know about this and will not
save this configuration in the ESCD.  A good PnP OS might update the
ESCD so you can use it later on for a non-PnP OS (like standard
Linux).  MS Windows does this only in special cases.  See 
<A HREF="#W9x_ESCD">Using Windows to set ESCD</A>.
<P>To use what's set in ESCD be sure you've set "Not a PnP OS" or the
like in the BIOS's CMOS.  Then each time the BIOS starts up (before
the Linux OS is loaded) it should configure things this way.  If the
BIOS detects a new PnP card which is not in the ESCD, then it must
allocate bus-resources to the card and update the ESCD.  It may even
have to change the bus-resources assigned to existing PnP cards and
modify the ESCD accordingly. 
<P>If each device saved its last configuration in its hardware, hardware
configuring wouldn't be needed each time you start your PC.  But it
doesn't work this way.  So all the ESCD data needs to be kept correct
if you use the BIOS for PnP.  There are some BIOSs that don't have an
ESCD but do have some non-volatile memory to store info regarding
which bus-resources have been reserved for use by non-PnP cards.  Many
BIOSs have both.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="W9x_ESCD"></A> Using Windows to set the ESCD  </H3>

<P> If the BIOS doesn't set up the ESCD the way you want it (or the
way it should be) then it would be nice to have a Linux utility to
set the ESCD.  As of early 1999 there wasn't any and now in late 2000
no one has told me about any.   Thus one may resort to attempting to
use Windows (if you have it on the same PC) to do this.
<P>There are three ways to use Windows to try to set/modify the ESCD.  One
way is to use the ICU utility designed for DOS or Windows 3.x.  It
should also work OK for Windows 9x/2k ??  Another way is to set up
devices manually ("forced") under Windows 9x/2k so that Windows will
put this info into the ESCD when Windows is shut down normally.  The
third way is only for legacy devices that are not plug-and-play.  If
Windows knows about them and what bus-resources they use, then Windows
should put this info into the ESCD.
<P>If PnP devices are configured automatically by Windows without the
user "forcing" it to change settings, then such settings probably will 
not make it into the ESCD.  Of course Windows may well decide on its
own to configure the same as what is set in the ESCD so they could
wind up being the same by coincidence.
<P>Windows 9x are PnP operating systems and automatically PnP-configure
devices.  They maintain their own PnP-database deep down in the
Registry (stored in binary Windows files).  There is also a lot of
other configuration stuff in the Registry besides PnP-bus-resources.
There is both a current PnP resource configuration in memory and
another (perhaps about the same) stored on the hard disk.  To look at
this in Windows98 or to force changes to it you use the Device Manager.
<P>In Windows98 there are 2 ways to get to the Device Manager: 1. My
Computer --> Control Panel --> System Properties --> Device Manager.
2. (right-click) My Computer --> Properties --> Device Manager.  Then
in Device Manager you select a device (sometimes a multi-step process
if there are a few devices of the same class).  Then click on
"Properties" and then on "Resources".  To attempt to change the
resource configuration manually, uncheck "Use automatic settings" and
then click on  "Change Settings".  Now try to change the setting, but
it may not let you change it.  If it does let you, you have "forced" a
change.  A message should inform you that it's being forced.  If you
want to keep the existing setting shown by Windows but make it
"forced" then you will have to force a change to something else and
then force it back to its original setting.
<P>To see what has been "forced" under Windows98 look at the "forced
hardware" list: Start --> Programs --> Accessories --> System Tools
--> System Information --> Hardware Resources --> Forced Hardware.
When you "force" a change of bus-resources in Windows, it should put
your change into the ESCD (provided you exit Windows normally).
From the "System Information" window you may also inspect how IRQs and
IO ports have been allocated under Windows.
<P>Even if Windows shows no conflict of bus-resources, there may be a
conflict under Linux.  That's because Windows may assign bus-resources
differently than the ESCD does.  In the the rare case where all
devices under Windows are either legacy devices or have been "forced",
then Windows and the ESCD configurations should be identical.
<P>
<H3>Adding a New Device (under Linux or Windows)</H3>

<P> If you add a new PnP device and have the BIOS set to "not a PnP
OS", then the BIOS should automatically configure it and store the
configuration in ESCD.  If it's a non-PnP legacy device (or one made
that way by jumpers, etc.) then here are a few options to handle it:
<P>You may be able to tell the BIOS directly (via the CMOS setup menus)
that certain bus-resources it uses (such as IRQs) are reserved and are
not to be allocated by PnP.  This does not put this info into the
ESCD.  But there may be a BIOS menu selection as to whether or not to
have these CMOS choices override what may be in the ESCD in case of
conflict.  Another method is to run ICU under DOS/Windows.  Still
another is to install it manually under Windows 9x/2k and then make
sure its configuration is "forced" (see the previous section).  If
it's "forced" Windows should update the ESCD when you shut down the
PC.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="disable_pnp"></A> <A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Disable PnP ? </A>
</H2>

<P> Many devices are PnP only with no option for disabling PnP.  But
for some, you may be able to disable PnP by jumpers or by running a
Windows program that comes with the device (jumperless configuration).
If the device driver can't configure it this will avoid the possibly
complicated task of doing PnP configuring.   Don't forget to tell the
BIOS that these bus-resources are reserved.  There are also some
reasons why you might not want to disable PnP:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> If you have MS Windows on the same machine, then you may want
to allow PnP to configure devices differently under Windows from what
it does under Linux.</LI>
<LI> The range of selection for IRQ numbers (or port addresses) etc.
may be quite limited unless you use PnP.</LI>
<LI> You might have a Linux device driver that uses PnP methods to
search for the device it controls.</LI>
<LI> If you need to change the configuration in the future, it may
be easier to do this if it's PnP (no setting of jumpers or running a
Dos/Windows program).</LI>
<LI> You may have (or will have) other PnP devices that need
configuring so that you'll need to provide for (or learn about) PnP
anyway.</LI>
</OL>

Once configured as non-PnP devices, they can't be configured by PnP
software or a PnP-BIOS (until you move jumpers and/or use the
Dos/Windows configuration software again).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="isapnp_"></A> <A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Isapnp (part of isapnptools) </A>
 </H2>

<P> Unfortunately, much of the documentation for isapnp is still
difficult to understand unless you know the basics of PnP.  This HOWTO
should help you understand it as well the FAQ that comes with it.
<CODE>isapnp</CODE> is only for PnP devices on the ISA bus (non-PCI).  Running
the Linux program "isapnp" at boot-time will configure such devices to
the resource values specified in /etc/isapnp.conf.  Its possible to
create this configuration file automatically but you then must edit it
manually to choose between various options.  
<P>With isapnp there's a danger that a device driver which is built into
the kernel may run too early before isapnp has set the address, etc.
in the hardware.  This results in the device driver not being able to
find the device.  The driver tries the right address but the address
hasn't been set yet in the hardware.
<P>If your Linux distribution automatically installed isapnptools, isapnp
may already be running at startup.  In this case, all you need to do
is to edit /etc/isapnp.conf per "<CODE>man isapnp.conf</CODE>".  Note that
this is like manually configuring PnP since you make the decisions as
to how to configure as you edit the configuration file.  You can use
the program "pnpdump" to help create the configuration file.  It
almost creates a configuration file for you but you must skillfully
edit it a little before using it.  It contains some comments to help
you edit it.  If you use "isapnp" for configuring and have a PnP BIOS,
you you may want to tell the BIOS (when you set it up) that you don't
have a PnP OS since you may want the BIOS to configure the PCI
devices.  While the BIOS may also configure the ISA devices, isapnp
will redo it.
<P>The terminology used in the /etc/isapnp.conf file may seem odd at
first.  For example for an I0 address of 0x3e8 you might see "(IO 0
(BASE 0x3e8))" instead.  The "IO 0" means this is the first (0th) IO
address-range that this device uses.   Another way to express all this
would be: "IO[0] = 0x3e8" but isapnp doesn't do it this way.  "IO 1"
would mean that this is the second IO address range used by this
device, etc.  "INT 0" has a similar meaning but for IRQs (interrupts).
A single card may contain several physical devices but the above
explanation was for just one of these devices.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="pciutils_"></A> <A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 PCI Utilities  </A>
</H2>

<P> The package PCI Utilities (= pciutils, incorrectly called
"pcitools"), should let you manually PnP-configure the PCI bus.
"lspci" or "scanpci" (Xwindows) lists bus-resources while "setpci"
sets resource allocations in the hardware devices.  It appears that
setpci is mainly intended for use in scripts and presently one needs to
know the details of the PCI configuration registers in order to use it.
That's a topic not explained here nor in the manual page for setpci.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="windows_conf"></A> <A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 Windows Configures  </A>
</H2>

<P> If you have Windows9x (or 2k) on the same PC, then just start
Windows and let it configure PnP.  Then start Linux from Windows (or
DOS).  But there may be a problem with IRQs for PCI devices.  As
Windows shuts down to make way for Linux, it may erase (zero) the IRQ
which is stored in one of the PCI device's configuration registers.
Linux will complain that it has found an IRQ of zero.
<P>The above is reported to happen if you start Linux using a shortcut
(PIF file).  But a workaround is reported where you still use the
shortcut PIF.  A shortcut is something like a symbolic link in Linux
but it's more than that since it may be "configured".  To start Linux
(from DOS you create a batch file (script) which starts Linux.  (The
program that starts Linux is in the package called "loadlin").  Then
create a PIF shortcut to that batch file and get to the "Properties"
dialog box for the shortcut.  Select "Advanced" and then check "MS-DOS
mode" to get it to start in genuine MS-DOS.
<P>Now here's the trick to prevent zeroing the PCI IRQs.  Check "Specify
a new MS-DOS configuration".  Then either accept the default
configuration presented to you or click on "Configuration" to change
it.  Now when you start Linux by clicking on the shortcut, new
configuration files (Config.sys and Autoexec.bat) will be created per
your new configuration.
<P>The old files are stored as "Config.wos and Autoexec.wos".  After you
are done using Linux and shut down your PC then you'll need these
files again so that you can run DOS the next time you start your PC.
You need to ensure that the names get restored to *.sys and *.bat.
When you leave Windows/DOS to enter Linux, Windows is expecting that
when you are done using Linux you will return to Windows so that
Windows can automatically restore these files to their original names.
But this doesn't happen since when you exit Linux you shut down your
PC and don't get back to Windows.  So how do you get these files
renamed?  It's easy, just put commands into your "start-Linux" batch
file to rename these files to their *.bat and *.sys names.  Put these
renaming commands into your batch file just before the line that loads
Linux.
<P>Also it's reported that you should click on the "General" tab (of the
"Properties" dialog of your shortcut) and check "Read-only".
Otherwise Windows may reset the "Advanced Settings" to "Use current
MS-DOS configuration" and PCI IRQs get zeroed.  Thus Windows erases
the IRQs when you use the current MS-DOS configuration but doesn't
erase when you use a new configuration (which may actually configure
things identical to the old configuration).  Windows does not seem to
be very consistent.
