<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>The <EM>X Window System</EM> is an advanced, network transparent,
windowing, graphical environment, developed at the <EM>Massachusetts
Institute of Technology</EM>, and first released in 1984. This document
assumes that you have installed X and it is functional. We intend to
learn how to use X productively, not so much how to compile the
programs;
most Linux distributions come with X as an option during installation,
compiled and ready to go.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Other Sources Of Information</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are just starting out, you may find the <EM>XFree86 HOWTO</EM>
and <EM>XFree86 Video Timings HOWTO</EM>s to be more helpful, and you
should be able to find that in the same place you found this. At the
end
of the document you will also find a Bibliography And Resources
section,
to find even more information. Oh, and don't forget to read the <B>man
pages</B>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Versions Of This Document</A>
</H2>

<P>New versions of this HOWTO may be periodically posted to 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.help">comp.os.linux.help</A> They will also
be uploaded to various Linux WWW and FTP sites, including 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP">Linux Documentation Project</A>
web
site.  The latest version can usually be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.croftj.net/~ray/howto">http://www.croftj.net/~ray/howto</A>, but the Metalab repository
is the canonical distribution point.
<P>Changes in version 1.1 include more coverage of <B>rxvt</B>,
expanded  coverage of X Resources, more trivial history of X, corrected 
references to SunSite to point to MetaLab, and instructions on using
Type 1 fonts with X.
<P>Changes in version 1.2 include much-requested coverage of using 
TrueType fonts in X, more details about setting up <CODE>xdm</CODE>, and a 
few more added resources. There is also a correction to my discussion 
of screen blanking features (thanks to Heinrich Langos for the 
correction!).
<P>Changes in version 1.3 include some fixes, info for corrupted
font paths in some recent distributions, and lots more info about
basic X security. I've also added some tips about KDE and an e-mail
address update.
<P>Changes in version 1.4 include corrections and additions from
Anthony J., and some very good security tips from Tomasz Motylewski.
<P>Changes in this version (2.0) includes corrections from Guus Bosch,
Brian J. Miller, and myself, as well as lots of new updates and info,
and a plea for a new maintainer!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Feedback And Corrections</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have questions or comments about this document, please feel
free
to email Ray Brigleb at my current (<CODE>ray@aracnet.com</CODE>) or
``permanent'' (<CODE>rayola@mindless.com</CODE>) address. I readily welcome
any
suggestions or criticisms. If you find any mistakes with this document,
please let me know so I can correct them in the next revision. If you
have information you would like to see in future revisions, or you
would
like to contribute to a future revision, drop me a line.  I'm also
looking for more resources to add to the sections and bibliography.
While we're at it, I'm also looking for someone interested in taking
over
maintenance of this document, please let me know if you're interested. 
I
think another maintainer might be able to breathe life into this
project
that I have not had as of late, and judging from the feedback I receive
this is still a very viable and useful text.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Acknowledgments</A>
</H2>

<P>A special thanks to the HOWTO coordinator Tim Bynum for help and
suggestions, and the XFree86 Group for the man pages and help files
that
come with XFree86.  I really need to thank all of those who have
written
documentation and descriptions of their offerings in the past, I have
just gleaned a selection of the most relevant items from their material
for this document. Also, thanks are due to Matt Chapman, author of the
Window Managers Guide website, and Scott Scriven, for the FVWM2 Themes
tips and tricks I stole from some of his hacks.  Thanks are also due to
Joe Croft for the Internet service, invaluable to the ongoing
development
of this HOWTO, and Claire Galper, for moral support and miscellaneous
tips. Last but not least, thanks to the whole GNU/Linux community, for
everything, and Mr. Stallman, for this text editor (and philosophy).
