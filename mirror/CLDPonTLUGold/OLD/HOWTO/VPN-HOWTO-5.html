<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Implementation</A>                </H2>

<P>In this section, I explain step by step how to set up your VPN system.  I'll start
with the server, and then move on to the client.  For the purposes of an example, I
will invent a situation that would require a couple of different kinds of VPN set up.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Planning</A>
                        </H2>

<P>Let's imagine that we have a company, called mycompany.com.  At our head
office, we are using the 192.168.0.0 reserved network, breaking the
class B into 256 class C networks to allow routing.  We have just set up
two small remote offices, and want to add them to our network.  We also
want to allow employees who work from home to be able to use their DSL
and cable modem connections instead of making them use dialup.  To
start, we need to plan things out a little.
<P>I decide that I want to give each remote office a class C network range
to allow them to expand as necessary.  So, I reserve the 192.168.10.0
and 192.168.11.0 nets.  I also decide that for home users, I've got
enough numbers that I don't need to masquerade them on the VPN server
side.  Each client gets it's own internal IP.  So, I need to reserve
another class C for that, say 192.168.40.0.  The only thing that I must
now do is to add these ranges to my router.  Let's imagine that our
company owns a small Cisco (192.168.254.254) that handles all of the
traffic through our OC1.  Just set routes on the Cisco such that traffic
headed to these reserved nets goes to our VPN server (192.168.40.254).
I put the VPN server into the home user's net for reasons that should
become clear later.  We'll name the external interface of the server
vpn.mycompany.com, and the internal vpn-internal.mycompany.com.
<P>As for external numbers, we don't need to know them explicitly. You
should have your own numbers, supplied by your ISP.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Gather the tools</A>
                        </H2>

<P>we're going to need a few pieces of software.  Get the following
packages, and install them where specified.
<H3>For the Server:                        </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>pppd (version 2.3 or greater)</LI>
<LI>ssh (version 1.2.26 or better)</LI>
</UL>
<H3>For the Client:                        </H3>

<P>
<UL>

</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Server: Build the kernel</A>
                        </H2>

<P>To start, you'll probably need to rebuild your kernel for the server.
You need to make sure that the following kernel options are turned on in
addition to basic networking and everything else that you might need. If
you've never built your own kernel before, read the 
<A HREF="/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HOWTO</A>.
<P>For 2.0 kernels:
<UL>
<LI>CONFIG_FIREWALL</LI>
<LI>CONFIG_IP_FORWARD</LI>
<LI>CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL</LI>
<LI>CONFIG_IP_ROUTER</LI>
<LI>CONFIG_PPP</LI>
</UL>
<P>For 2.2 kernels:
<UL>
<LI>CONFIG_FIREWALL</LI>
<LI>CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER</LI>
<LI>CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL</LI>
<LI>CONFIG_IP_ROUTER</LI>
<LI>CONFIG_PPP</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Server: Configure Networking</A>
                        </H2>

<P>If you are building a server that has only one network card, I suggest
that you think about buying another, and rewiring your network.  The
best way to keep your network private is to keep it on it's own wires. 
So if you do have two network cards, you'll need to know how to
configure both of them.  We'll use eth0 for the external interface, and eth1 for
the internal interface.
<H3>Configuring the interfaces                                </H3>

<P>We first should configure the external interface of the server.  You
should already know how to do this, and probably already have it done. 
If you don't, then do so now.  If you don't know how, go back and read
the 
<A HREF="/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO.html">Networking HOWTO</A><P>Now we bring up the internal interface.  According to the numbers that
we've chosen, the internal interface of the server is 192.168.40.254.
so we have to configure that interface.
<P>For 2.0 kernels, use the following:
<P>
<PRE>
# /sbin/ifconfig eth1 192.168.40.254 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.40.255
# /sbin/route add -net 192.168.40.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth1
</PRE>
<P>For 2.2 kernels, use the following:
<P>
<PRE>
# /sbin/ifconfig eth1 192.168.40.254 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.40.255
</PRE>
<P>That get's our basic interfaces up.  You can now talk to machines on
both local networks that are attached to the server.
<H3>Setting routes                                </H3>

<P>We can now talk to machines on our local nets, but we can't get to the rest
of our internal network.  That requires a few more lines of code.  In order
to reach the other machines on other subnets, we need have a route that tells
traffic to go to the Cisco router. Here's that line:
<PRE>
# /sbin/route add -net 192.168.0.0 gw 192.168.254.254 netmask 255.255.0.0 dev eth1
</PRE>
<P>That line tells the kernel that any traffic destined for the 192.168.0.0 network
should go out eth1, and that it should be handed off to the Cisco.  Traffic for
our local net still gets where it is supposed to because the routing tables
are ordered by the size of the netmask.  If we were to have other internal nets
in our network, we would have a line like the above for each net.
<H3>Making filter rules                                </H3>

<P>Ok, so we can reach every machine that we could need to.  Now we need to write
the firewall filtering rules that allow or deny access through the VPN server.
<P>To set the rules with <CODE>ipfwadm</CODE>, run it like so:
<P>
<PRE>
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -f
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -p deny
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a accept -S 192.168.40.0/24 -D 192.168.0.0/16
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a accept -b -S 192.168.10.0/24 -D 192.168.0.0/16
# /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a accept -b -S 192.168.11.0/24 -D 192.168.0.0/16
</PRE>
<P>To set the rules with <CODE>ipchains</CODE>, run it like so:
<P>
<PRE>
# /sbin/ipchains -F forward
# /sbin/ipchains -P forward DENY
# /sbin/ipchains -A forward -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.40.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/16
# /sbin/ipchains -A forward -j ACCEPT -b -s 192.168.10.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/16
# /sbin/ipchains -A forward -j ACCEPT -b -s 192.168.11.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/16
</PRE>
<P>This tells the kernel to deny all traffic except for the traffic that is coming
from the 192.168.40.0/24 network and destined for the 192.168.0.0/16 network. It
also tells the kernel that traffic going between the 192.168.10.0/24 and
192.168.0.0/16 nets is allowed, and the same for the 192.168.11.0 net.  These
last two are bidirectional rules, this is important for getting the routing
to work going both ways.
<H3>Routing                                </H3>

<P>For the home users, everything will work just fine to here.  However,
for the remote offices, we need to do some routing.  First of all, we
need to tell the main router, or Cisco, that the remote offices are
behind the VPN server.  So specify routes on the Cisco that tell
it to send traffic destined for the remote offices to the VPN server.
Now that that is taken care of, we must tell the VPN server what to do
with the traffic destined for the remote offices.  To do this, we run the
<CODE>route</CODE> command on the server.  The only problem is that in order
for the <CODE>route</CODE> command to work, the link must be up, and if
it goes down, the route will be lost.  The solution is to add the routes
when the clients connects, or more simply, to run the route command frequently
as it's not a problem to run it more than is necessary.  So, create a script
and add it to your crontab to be run every few minutes,  in it, put the
following:
<P>
<PRE>
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.11.0 gw 192.168.10.253 netmask 255.255.255.0
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.10.0 gw 192.168.11.253 netmask 255.255.255.0
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Server: Configure <CODE>pppd</CODE></A>
                        </H2>

<P>Now we will configure pppd on the server to handle VPN connections.  If
you are already using this server to handle dialup users or even dialing
out yourself, then you should note that these changes may affect those
services.  I go over how to avoid conflicts at the end of this section.
<H3><CODE>/etc/ppp/</CODE>                                </H3>

<P>This directory may contain a number of files.  You probably already
have a file called <CODE>options</CODE>.  This file holds all of the global
options for <CODE>pppd</CODE>.  These options cannot be overridden by <CODE>pppd</CODE> on the
command line.
<H3><CODE>/etc/ppp/options</CODE>                                </H3>

<P>Your <CODE>options</CODE> file should contain at least the following:
<P>
<PRE>
ipcp-accept-local
ipcp-accept-remote
proxyarp
noauth
</PRE>
<P>The first two lines tell <CODE>pppd</CODE> to accept what the other end specifies
for IP addresses.  This is necessary when hooking up remote offices, but can
be disabled if you are only connecting home users.  It's ok to leave it on, as
it does not prevent the server from assigning addresses, it only tells it that
it's ok to accept what the client asks for.
<P>The third line is very important.  From the <CODE>pppd</CODE> man page:
<P>
<PRE>
proxyarp
       Add an entry to this system's ARP [Address  Resolu-
       tion  Protocol]  table  with  the IP address of the
       peer and the Ethernet address of this system.  This
       will  have  the effect of making the peer appear to
       other systems to be on the local ethernet.
</PRE>
                
<P>This is important because if it is not done, local traffic will not be able
to get back through the tunnel.
<P>The last line is just as important.  This tells <CODE>pppd</CODE> to allow
connections without username and password.  This is safe since authentication
is already handled by <CODE>sshd</CODE>.
<H3>Avoiding conflicts                                </H3>

<P>If you are handling other services with <CODE>pppd</CODE>, you should
consider that the configurations for these other services may not be the
same as what the VPN system needs.  <CODE>pppd</CODE> is designed such that
the options in the main options file <CODE>/etc/ppp/options</CODE> cannot be
overridden by options specified at runtime.  This is done for security
reasons. In order to avoid conflict, determine which options cause the
conflict, and move them from the main file into a separate options file
that is loaded when the appropriate application of <CODE>pppd</CODE> is run.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Server: Configure <CODE>sshd</CODE></A>
                        </H2>

<P>The following is what my <CODE>/etc/sshd_config</CODE> file looks like.  Yours
should look the same or similar:
<P>
<PRE>
# This is the ssh server system wide configuration file.

Port 22
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
HostKey /etc/ssh_host_key
RandomSeed /etc/ssh_random_seed
ServerKeyBits 768
LoginGraceTime 600
KeyRegenerationInterval 3600
PermitRootLogin yes
IgnoreRhosts yes
StrictModes yes
QuietMode no
FascistLogging yes
CheckMail no
IdleTimeout 3d
X11Forwarding no
PrintMotd no
KeepAlive yes
SyslogFacility DAEMON
RhostsAuthentication no
RhostsRSAAuthentication no
RSAAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
UseLogin no
</PRE>
<P>The important points to note are that password authentication is disabled
as are all of the &quot;r&quot; services.  I have also turned off mail checking
and the message of the day as they can confuse <CODE>pppd</CODE> on the client side.
I still allow root login, but as this can only be done with a key, it is adequately
safe.
<H2><A NAME="user-accounts"></A> <A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 Server: Set up user accounts</A>
                        </H2>

<P>Now we'll set up the user accounts.
<H3>Add <CODE>vpn-users</CODE> group                                </H3>

<P>just run:
<P>
<PRE>
# /usr/sbin/groupadd vpn-users
</PRE>
<P>Now cat the <CODE>/etc/group</CODE> file and look at the last line.  It should be
the entry for the vpn-users group.  Note the third field.  This is the group ID (GID).
Write it down, as we'll need it in a minute.  For this example, the GID is 101.
<H3>create the <CODE>vpn-users</CODE> home directory                                </H3>

<P>We're going to use a single home directory for all of the users.  So just
run:
<P>
<PRE>
# mkdir /home/vpn-users
</PRE>
<H3>The <CODE>.ssh</CODE> directory                                </H3>

<P>Now create the <CODE>.ssh</CODE> directory in the <CODE>vpn-users</CODE> home
directory.
<P>
<PRE>
# mkdir /home/vpn-users/.ssh
</PRE>
<H3>Adding users                                </H3>

<P>Now comes the fun part.  We're going to edit the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file
by hand.  :)  Normally you let the system handle this file, but for a wierd
setup like this, it is easier to do it yourself.  To start, let's open the
<CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file and see what's in there.  Here's an example of what
you might find:
<P>
<PRE>
...
nobody:x:65534:100:nobody:/dev/null:
mwilson:x:1000:100:Matthew Wilson,,,:/home/mwilson:/bin/bash
joe:*:1020:101:Joe Mode (home),,,:/home/vpn-users:/usr/sbin/pppd
bill:*:1020:101:Bill Smith (home),,,:/home/vpn-users:/usr/sbin/pppd
frank:*:1020:101:Frank Jones (home),,,:/home/vpn-users:/usr/sbin/pppd
...
</PRE>
<P>You'll find the first user on most any system.  The second one is me. :)
After that are a few made up vpn-users. The first field is the username,
and the second is the password field. The third is user ID (UID) and the
fourth is the group ID (GID).  After that comes some info on who the
people are in the fifth field. The sixth field is the user's home
directory, and the last is their shell.  As you can see, each field is
separated by a colon.  Look at the last three lines. The only difference
between them is the username in the first field, and the user info in
the fifth field.  What we want to do is create lines like this for each
user.  Don't just use one user for all of the connections, you'll never
be able to tell them apart if you do.  So, copy the last line of this
file and edit it so that it looks something like the above.  Make sure
that the second field has an asterisk (*).  The second field should be
unique to all the other IDs in the file.  I used 1020.  You should use a
number above 1000, since those below are typically reserved for system
use.  The fourth field should be the group ID for vpn-users.  I told you
to write it down, now is the time that you need it. So put the group ID
in there.  Lastly, change the home directory to
<CODE>/home/vpn-users</CODE>, and the shell to <CODE>/usr/sbin/pppd</CODE>. 
That's it.  Now copy that line to make more users.  Just edit the first
the fifth fields and you're set.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.8">5.8 Server: Administration</A>
                        </H2>

<P>One of the advantages to using this system for user accounts is that you
can take advantage of the UNIX user administration commands.  Since each client
is logged in as a user, you can use standard methods to get user statistics.
The following are a few commands that I like to use to see what all is going on.
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>who</B><DD><P>Prints the users currently logged in, as well as when they logged in,
from where (name or IP), and on which port.
<P>
<DT><B>w</B><DD><P>This command prints a more extensive listing of who is currently logged
in.  It also tells you uptime and load averages for the system.  It also lists
the user's current process (which should be -pppd for VPN clients) as well
as idle time, and current CPU usage for all processes as well as the current
process.  Read the <CODE>w</CODE> man page for more info.
<P>
<DT><B>last [username]</B><DD><P>This lists the login history for the specified user, or for all users if
a username is not provided.  It's most useful for finding out how well
the tunnels are running as it prints the length of time that the user
was logged in, or states that the user is still logged in. I should warn
you that on a system that has been up a long time, this list can grow
extremely long.  Pipe is through <CODE>grep</CODE> or <CODE>head</CODE> to find
out exactly what you want to know.
</DL>
<P>You can also control which users are allowed to connect by modifying the
<CODE>/home/vpn-users/.ssh/authorized_keys</CODE> file.  If you remove the user's
public key line from this file, they won't be able to log in.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.9">5.9 Client: Build the kernel</A>
                        </H2>

<P>Now we move onto the client.  First we must rebuild the kernel so that it can support
all of the functions that we need.  The minimum requirement is to have ppp in the
kernel.  After that, you will need forwarding, firewalling, and gatewaying only
if you are going to allow other machines access to the tunnel.  For this example, I
will setup one of the remote office machines in my example layout.  Add the following
options to your kernel.  Again, if you've never built a kernel before, read the

                        </H2>

<P>Now we should setup the networking on our client box.  Let's assume that
we've configured the external network and that it works.  Now we will configure
the internal interface of the client to service our intranet.

<P>You may not need to edit the client's <CODE>/etc/ppp/options</CODE> file at
all. You will if the "auth" option is present, or some of the other
priveledged options.  Try it, and if it fails, a black
<CODE>/etc/ppp/options</CODE> will work. just keep adding the options from
the old file to figure out which one broke it (if it's not obvious) and
see if you can get around that.  Maybe you don't need them at all.  You
probably don't if you don't use <CODE>pppd</CODE> for anything else.

<CODE>.ssh</CODE> directory.  The first is your private key, and should be kept such.
<EM>NEVER SEND THIS OVER THE NET</EM> unless it is via an encrypted session.  The
second file is your public key, and you can send this anywhere you want, it only
serves to allow you access to other systems, and cannot be used to get into your
own.  It is a text file with one line in it that is your actual key.  At the end
of the line is the comment field which you may change without fear of breaking
the key.  an example key looks something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
1024 35 1430723736674162619588314275167.......250872101150654839 root@vpn-client.mycompany.com
</PRE>
<P>It's actually a lot longer than that, but it wouldn't fit on the page if I
showed the whole thing.  Copy your key into the <CODE>/home/vpn-users/.ssh/authorized_keys</CODE>
file on the server.  Make sure that there is only one key per line, and
that each key is not broken onto multiple lines.  You may alter
the comment field all that you like in order to help you remember which
line goes with which user.  I highly recommend doing so.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.13">5.13 Client: Bring up the connection</A>
                        </H2>

<P>Now we'll try to actually make the connection to the VPN server.  First
we'll need to make a single connection the set up <CODE>ssh</CODE>'s known_hosts
file.  Run this:
<P>
<PRE>
# ssh vpn.mycompany.com
</PRE>
<P>Answer ''yes'' when it asks you if you want to continue connecting.  The
server will tell you ''permission denied'', but that''s ok. It's
important that you use the same name for the server that you are using
in your connection scripts.  Now run the following lines.  You will
obviously need to change most of the options to fit your setup.
<P>
<PRE>
# /usr/sbin/pty-redir /usr/bin/ssh -t -e none -o 'Batchmode yes' -c blowfish -i /root/.ssh/identity.vpn -l vpn-user vpn.mycompany.com > /tmp/vpn-device

        (now wait about 10 seconds)

# /usr/sbin/pppd `cat /tmp/vpn-device` 192.168.10.254:192.168.40.254
</PRE>
<P>Note the IP addresses specified on the pppd line.  The first is the
address of the client end of the tunnel.  The second is the address of
the server end of the tunnel, which is set to the server's internal
address.  If all of that seemed to work, move on.  If not, check that you
have all of the options, and that they are spelled right.  If something
is still going wrong, check the 
<A HREF="VPN-HOWTO-6.html#pitfalls">Pitfalls section</A>.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.14">5.14 Client: Set the routes</A>
                        </H2>

<P>Now set the route to send traffic through the tunnel.  Just run this:
<P>
<PRE>
# /sbin/route add -net 192.168.0.0 gw vpn-internal.mycompany.com netmask 255.255.0.0
</PRE>
<P>You should now be able to communicate with machines on the other side of
the tunnel.  Give it a try.  Neat huh?  If it doesn't work, try using
<CODE>ping</CODE> and <CODE>traceroute</CODE> to figure out where your problem
might be.  If in fact it does work, move on to setting up scripts to do
the work for you.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.15">5.15 Client: Scripting</A>
                        </H2>

<P>Use the vpnd script that I show 
<@@ref>vpn-scripthere</A>.  Only, you
need to modify it a little.  Make the following changes:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Change the variables at the top to match your setup.  Most should be just
fine as they are, but you can change them should you need to.</LI>
<LI>Line 27: add the local and remote IP addresses before $PPP_OPTIONS</LI>
<LI>Line 31: Change this line, and the two after it to set routes for
your internal nets.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Keeping it running                                </H3>

<P>While bash scripts are generally stable, they have been known to fail. 
In order to make sure that the <CODE>vpnd</CODE> script keeps running, add
an entry to the client's crontab that runs the <CODE>check-vpnd</CODE>
script. I run mine every 5 minutes or so.  If <CODE>vpnd</CODE> is indeed
running, <CODE>check-vpnd</CODE> doesn't use much CPU.
