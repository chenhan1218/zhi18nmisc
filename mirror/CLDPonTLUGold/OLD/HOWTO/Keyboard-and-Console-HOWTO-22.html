<P>Several people have noticed that they lose typed characters when
a floppy disk is active. It seems that this might be a problem with
Uni-486WB motherboards.
(Please mail me (<CODE>aeb@cwi.nl</CODE>) to confirm [yes, I have the same
problem], deny [no, nothing wrong with my Uni-486WB],
modify [My Xyzzy machine has the same problem].)
<P>Tjalling Tjalkens (<CODE>tjalling@ei.ele.tue.nl</CODE>) reports very similar problems
with "a no-brand GMB-486 UNP Vesa motherboard with AMD 486DX2-66 CPU" -
during floppy activity some keystrokes are lost, during floppy tape streamer
(Conner C 250 MQ) activity many keystrokes are lost.
<P>Some people experience sporadic lockups - sometimes associated to
hard disk activity or other I/O.

`I have had the same problems, when I had my motherboard tuned too fast.
So I reset all the timings ( CLK, wait statements etc ) to more 
conventional values, and the problems are gone.'

`If you have an AMI BIOS, you might try setting the Gate A20 emulation
parameter to "chipset" (if you have that option). Whenever I have had
that parameter set to any of the other options on my machine
("fast", "both", "disabled") I have had frequent keyboard lockups.'
