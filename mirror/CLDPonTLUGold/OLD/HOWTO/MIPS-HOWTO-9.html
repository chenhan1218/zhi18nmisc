<H2><A NAME="s9">9. How do I set up a cross-compiler?</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Available binaries</A>
</H2>

<P>The easiest way to setup a cross-compiler is to just download the binaries.
For Linux/i386 hosts and big endian targets, these are the packages:
<PRE>
  binutils-mips-linux-2.8.1-1.i386.rpm
  egcs-c++-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-g77-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-libstdc++-mips-linux-2.9.0-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-objc-mips-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
 
</PRE>
<P>And this is the list of packages for little endian targets:
<PRE>
  binutils-mipsel-linux-2.8.1-1.i386.rpm
  egcs-c++-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-g77-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-libstdc++-mipsel-linux-2.9.0-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
  egcs-objc-mipsel-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
 
</PRE>
<P>For 64-bit MIPS kernels, there is only one package available right
now:
<PRE>
  egcs-mips64-linux-1.1.2-2.i386.rpm
 
</PRE>
<P>This compiler is only available in the big endian flavor as there currently
is no little endian machine supported by the 64-bit kernel.  A little endian
version of the compiler will be provided as soon as there is demand for one.
<P>It's not necessary that you install all of these packages as most people can
just omit the C++, Objective&nbsp;C and Fortran&nbsp;77 compilers.  The
Intel binaries have been linked against GNU libc 2.1, so you may have
to install that as well when upgrading.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Recommended compiler versions</A>
</H2>

<P>Compilers older than egcs 1.1.2 are no longer supported for compiling kernels
due to bugs in the generated code.  At this time, we still recommend
binutils 2.8.1 despite their age.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Building your own cross-compiler</A>
</H2>

<P>First of all, go and download the following source packages:
<UL>
<LI>binutils-2.8.1.tar.gz</LI>
<LI>egcs-1.1.2.tar.gz</LI>
<LI>glibc-2.0.6.tar.gz</LI>
<LI>glibc-crypt-2.0.6.tar.gz</LI>
<LI>glibc-localedata-2.0.6.tar.gz</LI>
<LI>glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.6.tar.gz</LI>
</UL>

You can obtain these files from your favorite GNU archive or
<A HREF="ftp://oss.sgi.com">oss.sgi.com</A>.  Furthermore, you'll
need patches.  The unbundled patch files aren't always up-to-date and addional,
not MIPS-specific, patches may be required for building.  Note that the
unbundled patch files also use a different revision numbering and it is
therefore recommended that you obtain the source and patches from the RPM packages
distributed on 
<A HREF="ftp://oss.sgi.com">oss.sgi.com</A>.
<P>Those are the currently recommended versions.  Older versions may or may not
be working.  If you're trying to use older versions, please don't send
bug reports because we don't care.  When installing, please install things in the
order of binutils, egcs, then glibc.  Unless you have older versions
already installed, changing the order <I>will</I> fail.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Disk space requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>For the installation, you'll have to choose a directory where the files will be
installed. I'll refer to that directory below with &lt;prefix>.  To avoid a particular
problem, it's best to use the same value for &lt;prefix> as your native gcc.
For example, if your gcc is installed in /usr/bin/gcc, then choose /usr for
&lt;prefix>.  You must use the same &lt;prefix> value for all the packages
that you're going to install.
<P>During compilation, you'll need about 31MB disk space for binutils. For
installation, you'll need 7MB disk space on &lt;prefix>'s
partition.  Building egcs requires 71MB, and installation 14MB.  GNU libc
requires 149MB disk space during compilation, and 33MB for installation.
Note, these numbers are just a guideline and may differ significantly for
different processor and operating system architectures or compiler options.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5 Byte order</A>
</H2>

<P>One of the special features of the MIPS architecture is that all processors
except the R8000 can be configured to run either in big or in little endian
mode.  Byte order means the way the processor stores multibyte numbers in
memory.  Big endian machines store the byte with the highest value digits
at the lowest address while little endian machines store it at the highest
address.  Think of it as writing multi-digit numbers from left to
right or vice versa.
<P>In order to setup your cross-compiler correctly, you have to know the byte
order of the cross-compiler target.  If you don't already know, check
the section 
<A HREF="MIPS-HOWTO-3.html#hardware-platforms">Hardware Platforms</A> for your
machine's byte order.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.6">9.6 Configuration names</A>
</H2>

<P>Many of the packages based on autoconf support many different
architectures and operating systems.  In order to differentiate between
these many configurations, names are constructed with
&lt;cpu>-&lt;company>-&lt;os>, or even
&lt;cpu>-&lt;company>-&lt;kernel>-&lt;os>.  Expressed this way,
the configuration names of Linux/MIPS are: mips-unknown-linux-gnu for big
endian targets, or mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu for little endian targets.  These
names are a bit long and are allowed to be abbreviated to mips-linux or
mipsel-linux.  You <I>must</I> use the same configuration name for all
packages that comprise your cross-compilation environment.  Also, while
other names, like mips-sni-linux or mipsel-sni-linux, are legal configuration
names, use mips-linux or mipsel-linux instead. These are the configuration
names known to other packages, like the Linux kernel sources, and they would
otherwise have to be changed for cross-compilation.
<P>I'll refer to the target configuration name below with &lt;target>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.7">9.7 Installation of GNU Binutils.</A>
</H2>

<P>This is the first and simplest part (at least as long as you're trying to
install on any halfway-sane UNIX flavour).  Just cd into a directory with
enough free space and do the following:
<PRE>
   gzip -cd binutils-&lt;version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd binutils-&lt;version>
   patch -p1 &lt; ../binutils-&lt;version>-mips.patch
   ./configure --prefix=&lt;prefix> --target=&lt;target>
   make CFLAGS=-O2
   make install
  
</PRE>

This usually works correctly.  However, certain machines using GCC 2.7.x as
compiler are known to dump core.  This is a known bug in GCC and can be fixed
by upgrading the host compiler to GCC 2.8.1 or better.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.8">9.8 Assert.h</A>
</H2>

<P>Some people have an old assert.h header file installed, probably leftover
from an old cross-compiler installation.  This file may cause autoconf
scripts to fail silently. Assert.h was never necessary and was only installed
because of a bug in older GCC versions.  Check to see if the file
&lt;prefix>/&lt;target>/include/assert.h exists in your installation.  If
so, just delete the it - it should never have been installed for any version
of the cross-compiler and will cause trouble.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.9">9.9 Installing the kernel sources</A>
</H2>

<P>Installing the kernel sources is simple.  Just place them into some directory
of your choice and configure them.  Configuring them is necessary so that
files which are generated by the procedure will be installed.  Make sure
you enable CONFIG_CROSSCOMPILE near the end of the configuration process.
The only problem you may run into is that you may need to install some
required GNU programs like bash or have to override the manufacturer-provided
versions of programs by placing the GNU versions earlier in the PATH variable.
Now, go to the directory &lt;prefix>/&lt;target>/include and create two
symbolic links named asm and linux pointing to include/asm rsp. include/linux
within your just installed and configured kernel sources.  These are
necessary such that the necessary header files will be found during the next
step.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.10">9.10 First installation of egcs</A>
</H2>

<P>Now the pain begins.  There is a so-called bootstrap problem.
In our case, this means that the installation process of egcs needs an already
installed glibc, but we cannot compile glibc because we don't have a
working cross-compiler yet.  Luckily, you'll only have to go through this
once when you install a cross-compiler for the first time.  Later, when you
already have glibc installed, things will be much smoother.  So now do:
<PRE>
   gzip -cd egcs-1.1.2.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd egcs-&lt;version>
   patch -p1 &lt; ../egcs-1.1.2-mips.patch
   ./configure --prefix=&lt;prefix> --with-newlib --target=&lt;target>
   make SUBDIRS="libiberty texinfo gcc" ALL_TARGET_MODULES= \
           CONFIGURE_TARGET_MODULES= INSTALL_TARGET_MODULES= LANGUAGES="c"
 
</PRE>

Note that we deliberately don't build gcov, protoize, unprotoize, and the
libraries.  Gcov doesn't make sense in a cross-compiler environment, and
protoize and unprotoize might even overwrite your native programs - this
is a bug in the gcc makefiles.  Finally, we cannot build the libraries
because we don't have glibc installed yet.  If everything went successfully,
install with:
<PRE>
   make SUBDIRS="libiberty texinfo gcc" INSTALL_TARGET_MODULES= \
           LANGUAGES="c" install
 
</PRE>
<P>If you only want the cross-compiler for building the kernel, you're done.
Cross-compiling libc is only required to be able to compile user applications.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.11">9.11 Test what you've done so far</A>
</H2>

<P>Just to make sure that what you've done so far is actually working, you
may now try to compile the kernel.  Cd to the MIPS kernel's sources and
type ``make clean; make dep; make''.  If everything went ok do ``make clean''
once more to clean the sources.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.12">9.12 Installing GNU libc</A>
</H2>

<P><I>Note: Building glibc 2.0.6 using a compiler newer than egcs 1.0.3a is not
recommended due to binary compatibility problems which may hit certain
software.  It's recommended that you either use egcs 1.0.3a or use the files
from a published binary package.  Crosscompiling GNU libc is always only the
second best solution as certain parts of it will not be compiled when
crosscompiling.  A proper solution will be documented here as soon as it is
available and believed to be stable.</I>  With this warning given, here's the
recipe:
<PRE>
   gzip -cd glibc-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd glibc-2.0.6
   gzip -cd glibc-crypt-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
   gzip -cd glibc-localedata-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
   gzip -cd glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
   patch -p1 &lt; ../glibc-2.0.6-mips.patch
   mkdir build
   cd build
   CC=&lt;target>-gcc BUILD_CC=gcc AR=&lt;target>-ar RANLIB=&lt;target>-ranlib \
         ../configure --prefix=/usr --host=&lt;target> \
         --enable-add-ons=crypt,linuxthreads,localedata --enable-profile
   make
 
</PRE>

You now have a compiled GNU libc which still needs to be installed.  Do
<I>not</I> just type make install.  That would overwrite your host
system's files with Linux/MIPS-specific files with disastrous effects.
Instead, install GNU libc into some other arbitrary directory &lt;somedir>
from which we'll move the parts we need for cross-compilation into the
actual target directory:
<PRE>
   make install_root=&lt;somedir> install
 
</PRE>

Now cd into &lt;somedir> and finally install GNU libc manually:
<PRE>
   cd usr/include
   find . -print | cpio -pumd &lt;prefix>/&lt;target>/include
   cd ../../lib
   find . -print | cpio -pumd &lt;prefix>/&lt;target>/lib
   cd ../usr/lib
   find . -print | cpio -pumd &lt;prefix>/&lt;target>/lib
 
</PRE>

GNU libc also contains extensive online documentation.  Your system might
already have a version of this documentation installed, so if you don't
want to install the info pages, which will save you a less than a megabyte,
or already have them installed, skip the next step:
<PRE>
   cd ../info
   gzip -9 *.info*
   find . -name \*.info\* -print | cpio -pumd &lt;prefix>/info
 
</PRE>

If you're not bootstrapping, your installation is now finished.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.13">9.13 Building egcs again</A>
</H2>

<P>The first attempt of building egcs was stopped by lack of a GNU
libc.  Since we now have libc installed we can rebuild egcs but this
time as complete as a cross-compiler installation can be:
<PRE>
   gzip -cd egcs-&lt;version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd egcs-&lt;version>
   patch -p1 &lt; ../egcs-1.1.2-mips.patch
   ./configure --prefix=&lt;prefix> --target=&lt;target>
   make LANGUAGES="c c++ objective-c f77"
 
</PRE>

As you can see, the procedure is the same as the first time, with the
exception that we dropped the --with-newlib option.  This option was
necessary to avoid the libgcc build breaking due to the lack of
libc.  Now install with:
<PRE>
   make LANGUAGES="c c++ objective-c f77" install
 
</PRE>

You're almost finished.  If you think you don't need the Objective&nbsp;C or
F77 compilers, you can omit them from above commands. Each will save you about
3MB.  Do not build gcov, protoize, or unprotoize.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.14">9.14 Should I build the C++, Objective&nbsp;C or F77 compilers?</A>
</H2>

<P>The answer to this question largely depends on your use of your cross-compiler
environment.  If you only intend to rebuild the Linux kernel, then you have
no need for the full blown setup and can safely omit the Objective&nbsp;C and
F77 compilers.  You must, however, build the C++ compiler, because building
the libraries included with the egcs distribution requires C++.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.15">9.15 How about float.h?</A>
</H2>

<P>The installation of float.h is no longer necessary. Since about egcs 1.0.3a,
a proper float.h header file will automatically be generated and installed.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.16">9.16 Known problem when cross-compiling</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>IRIX crashes</H3>

<P>Origin&nbsp;200 running IRIX 6.5.1 may crash when running ``make depend''
on the Linux kernel sources.  IRIX&nbsp;6.5 on Indy and IRIX&nbsp;6.5.4 on
Origin&nbsp;200 are known to work.  Further reports that help to isolate
the problematic configuration are welcome.
<P>
<H3>Resource limits on System&nbsp;V based hosts</H3>

<P>Typical System&nbsp;V-based Unices, like IRIX or Solaris, have limits for
the maximum number of arguments to be passed to a child process which
may be exceeded when cross-compiling some software like the Linux kernel
or GNU libc.  For IRIX systems, the maximum length of the argument list
defaults to 20KB, while Linux defaults to at least 128KB.  This size
can be modified by the command ``systune ncargs 131072'' as root.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.17">9.17 GDB</A>
</H2>

<P>Building GDB as cross-debugger is only of interest to kernel developers. For
them, GDB may be a life saver.  Such a remote debugging setup always
consists of two parts:  the remote debugger GDB running on one machine, and
the target machine running the Linux/MIPS kernel being debugged.  The machines
are typically interconnected with a serial line.  The target machine's kernel
needs to be equipped with a ``debugging stub'' which communicates with the
GDB host machine using the remote serial protocol.
<P>
<P>Depending on the target's architecture, you may have to implement the
debugging stub yourself.  In general, you'll only have to write very simple
routines for the serial line.  The task is further simplified by the fact that most
machines are using similar serial hardware, typically based on the 8250,
16450 or derivatives.
