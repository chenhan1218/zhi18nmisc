<H2><A NAME="security"></A> <A NAME="s11">11. Security of Database </A></H2>

<P>Database security is addressed at several levels:
<UL>
<LI> Database file protection. All files stored within the database are 
protected from reading by any account other than the <I>postgres</I>
superuser account</LI>
<LI> Connections from a client to the database server are, by default,
allowed only via an local UNIX socket, not via TCP/IP sockets. The back-end
must be started with the -i option to allow nonlocal clients to connect.</LI>
<LI> Client connections can be restricted by IP address and/or username
via the <B>pg_hba.conf</B> file in <B>$PG_DATA</B>.</LI>
<LI> Client connections may be authenticated via other external packages.</LI>
<LI> Each user in Postgres is assigned an username and (optionally) a password.
By default, users do not have write access to databases they did not create.</LI>
<LI> Users may be assigned to groups, and table access may be restricted based
on group priveleges.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 User Authentication</A>
</H2>

<P>Authentication is the process by which the backend server and postmaster 
ensure that the user requesting access to data is in fact who he/she 
claims to be. All users who invoke Postgres are checked against the contents
of the <B>pg_user</B> class to ensure that they are authorized to do so. However,
verification of the user's actual identity is performed in a variety 
of ways: 
<UL>
<LI> <B>From the user shell:</B> A backend server started from an user shell 
notes the user's (effective) user-id before performing a 
<B>setuid</B> to the user-id of user <B>postgres</B>. The effective user-id is used as
the basis for access control checks. No other authentication is conducted. </LI>
<LI> <B>From the network:</B> If the Postgres system is built as distributed, access to the 
Internet TCP port of the postmaster process is available to anyone. The DBA
configures the <B>pg_hba.conf</B> file in the <B>$PGDATA</B> directory to specify what 
authentication system is to be used according to the host making the connection
and which database it is connecting to. 
See <B>pg_hba.conf(5)</B> (man 5 pg_hba.conf) 
for a description
of the authentication systems available. Of course, host-based authentication 
is not fool-proof in Unix, either. It is possible for determined intruders
to also masquerade the origination host. Those security issues are beyond
the scope of Postgres.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Host-Based Access Control</A>
</H2>

<P>Host-based access control is the name for the basic controls PostgreSQL
exercises on what clients are
allowed to access a database and how the users on those clients must 
authenticate themselves.
Each database system contains a file named <B>pg_hba.conf</B>, in its 
<B>$PGDATA</B> directory, which controls who 
can connect to each database.
Every client accessing a database must be covered by one of the 
entries in <B>pg_hba.conf</B>. Otherwise all
attempted connections from that client will be rejected with a
<B>"User authentication failed"</B> error message.
<P>See online man page of <B>pg_hba.conf(5)</B> (man 5 pg_hba.conf).
<P>The general format of the <B>pg_hba.conf</B> file is of a set of records, one
per line. Blank lines and lines
beginning with a hash character ("#") are ignored. A record is made up of
a number of fields which
are
separated by spaces and/or tabs.
<P>Connections from clients can be made using Unix domain sockets or Internet
domain sockets (ie.
TCP/IP). Connections made using Unix domain sockets are controlled using
records of the following
format:
<HR>
<PRE>
local database authentication method
</PRE>
<HR>

where
<P><B>database</B> specifies the database that this record applies to. The value 
<B>all</B> specifies that it applies to
all databases.
<P><B>authentication method</B> specifies the method an user must use to authenticate
themselves when
connecting to that database using Unix domain sockets. The different 
methods are described
below.
<P>Connections made using Internet domain sockets are controlled using 
records of the following format.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
host database TCP/IP-address TCP/IP-mask authentication method
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The <B>TCP/IP</B> address is <I>logically and'ed</I> to both the specified TCP/IP mask
and the TCP/IP address of the
connecting client. If the two resulting values are equal then the record 
is used for this connection. If a
connection matches more than one record then the earliest one in the
file is used. Both the TCP/IP
address and the TCP/IP mask are specified in dotted decimal notation.
If a connection fails to match any record then the reject authentication 
method is applied (see 
<A HREF="#auth_method">Authentication Methods</A>).
<H2><A NAME="auth_method"></A> <A NAME="ss11.3">11.3 Authentication Methods </A>
</H2>

<P>The following authentication methods are supported for both Unix and TCP/IP domain sockets:
<UL>
<LI> <B>trust</B>
The connection is allowed unconditionally.</LI>
<LI> <B>reject</B>
The connection is rejected unconditionally.</LI>
<LI> <B>crypt</B>
The client is asked for a password for the user. This is sent encrypted (using crypt(3)) and compared
against the password held in the pg_shadow table. If the passwords match, the connection is allowed.</LI>
<LI> <B>password</B>
The client is asked for a password for the user. This is sent in clear and compared against the
password held in the <B>pg_shadow</B> table. If the passwords match, the connection is allowed. An
optional password file may be specified after the password keyword which is used to match the
supplied password rather than the <B>pg_shadow</B> table. See <B>pg_passwd</B>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following authentication methods are supported for TCP/IP domain sockets only:
<UL>
<LI> <B>krb4</B>
Kerberos V4 is used to authenticate the user.</LI>
<LI> <B>krb5</B>
Kerberos V5 is used to authenticate the user.</LI>
<LI> <B>ident</B>
The ident server on the client is used to authenticate the user (RFC 1413). An optional map name
may be specified after the <B>ident</B> keyword which allows ident user names to be mapped onto Postgres
user names. Maps are held in the file <B>$PGDATA/pg_ident.conf</B>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Here are some examples:
<HR>
<PRE>
# Trust any connection via Unix domain sockets.
local   trust
# Trust any connection via TCP/IP from this machine.
host    all 127.0.0.1   255.255.255.255     trust
# We don't like this machine.
host    all 192.168.0.10    255.255.255.0       reject
# This machine can't encrypt so we ask for passwords in clear.
host    all 192.168.0.3 255.255.255.0       password
# The rest of this group of machines should provide encrypted passwords.
host    all 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0       crypt
</PRE>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4 Access Control</A>
</H2>

<P>Postgres provides mechanisms to allow users to limit the access to their data that is provided to other
users.
<UL>
<LI> <B>Database superusers</B>
Database super-users (i.e., users who have <B>pg_user.usesuper</B> set) silently bypass all of the access
controls described below with two exceptions: manual system catalog updates are not permitted if the
user does not have <B>pg_user.usecatupd</B> set, and destruction of system catalogs (or modification of their
schemas) is never allowed.</LI>
<LI> <B>Access Privilege</B>
The use of access privilege to limit reading, writing and setting of rules on 
classes is covered in SQL <B>grant/revoke(l)</B>.</LI>
<LI> <B>Class removal and schema modification</B>
Commands that destroy or modify the structure of an existing class, such as alter, drop table, and
drop index, only operate for the owner of the class. As 
mentioned above, these operations are never 
permitted on system catalogs. </LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 Secure TCP/IP Connection via SSH</A>
</H2>

<P>You can use <B>ssh</B> to encrypt the network connection between clients and a Postgres server. Done properly,
this should lead to an adequately secure network connection.
<P>The documentation for <B>ssh</B> provides most of the information to get started. Please refer to
<A HREF="http://www.heimhardt.de/htdocs/ssh.html">http://www.heimhardt.de/htdocs/ssh.html</A> for better insight.
A step-by-step explanation can be done in just two steps.
<P><B>Running a secure tunnel via ssh: </B>
A step-by-step explanation can be done in just two steps.
<UL>
<LI> Establish a tunnel to the back-end machine, like this:
<HR>
<PRE>
ssh -L 3333:wit.mcs.anl.gov:5432 postgres@wit.mcs.anl.gov
</PRE>
<HR>
</LI>
<LI> The first number in the <B>-L</B> argument, <B>3333</B>, is the port number of your end of the tunnel. The
second number, <B>5432</B>, is the remote end of the tunnel -- the port number your backend is using.
The name or the address in between the port numbers belongs to the server machine, as does the
last argument to <B>ssh</B> that also includes the optional user name. Without the user name, <B>ssh</B> will try 
the name you are currently logged on as on the client machine. You can use any user name the
server machine will accept, not necessarily those related to postgres.</LI>
<LI> Now that you have a running <B>ssh</B> session, you can connect a postgres client to your local host at the
port number you specified in the previous step. If it's <B>psql</B>, you will need another shell because the
shell session you used in step 1 is now occupied with <B>ssh</B>.
<HR>
<PRE>
psql -h localhost -p 3333 -d mpw
</PRE>
<HR>
</LI>
<LI> Note that you have to specify the <B>-h</B> argument to cause your client to use the TCP socket instead
of the Unix socket. You can omit the port argument if you chose <B>5432</B> as your end of the tunnel.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6 Kerberos Authentication</A>
</H2>

<P>Kerberos is an industry-standard secure authentication system suitable for distributed computing over a
public network.
<P><B>Availability: </B>
The Kerberos authentication system is not distributed with Postgres. Versions of Kerberos are typically
available as optional software from operating system vendors. In addition, a source code distribution may
be obtained through MIT Project Athena.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
Note: You may wish to obtain the MIT version even if your vendor provides a version, since
some vendor ports have been deliberately crippled or rendered non-interoperable with the MIT
version.
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Inquiries regarding your Kerberos should be directed to your vendor or MIT Project Athena. Note that
FAQLs (Frequently-Asked Questions Lists) are periodically posted to the Kerberos mailing list (send mail
to subscribe), and USENET news group.
<P><B>Installation: </B>
Installation of Kerberos itself is covered in detail in the Kerberos Installation Notes . Make sure that the
server key file (the <B>srvtab</B> or <B>keytab</B>) is somehow readable by the Postgres account.
Postgres and its clients can be compiled to use either Version 4 or Version 5 of the MIT Kerberos
protocols by setting the KRBVERS variable in the file <B>src/Makefile.global</B> to the appropriate value. You
can also change the location where Postgres expects to find the associated libraries, header files
and its   
own server key file.
After compilation is complete, Postgres must be registered as a Kerberos service. See the Kerberos
Operations Notes and related manual pages for more details on registering services.
<P><B>Operation: </B>
After initial installation, Postgres should operate in all ways as a normal Kerberos service. For details on
the use of authentication, see the <I>PostgreSQL User's Guide</I> reference sections for <B>postmaster</B> and <B>psql</B>.
<P>In the Kerberos Version 5 hooks, the following assumptions are made about user and service naming(also, see Table below):
<UL>
<LI> User principal names (anames) are assumed to contain the actual Unix/Postgres user name in the
first component.</LI>
<LI> The Postgres service is assumed to be have two components, the service name and a hostname,
canonicalized as in Version 4 (i.e., with all domain suffixes removed).</LI>
