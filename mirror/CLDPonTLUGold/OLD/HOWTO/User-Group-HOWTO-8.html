<P>New versions of the Linux User Group HOWTO will be periodically
uploaded to various Linux WWW and FTP sites, principally

<P> 
I welcome questions about and feedback on this document. Please send
them to me at 
<A HREF="mailto:kclark@cmpu.net">kclark@cmpu.net</A>. <I>I am especially interested in
hearing from leaders of LUGs from around the world</I>. I would like
to include real-life examples of the things described here. I would
also like to include a section on LUGs outside the United States,
since this HOWTO as it stands now is rather US-centric. Please let me
know if your group does things that should be mentioned in this HOWTO.

</H2>

<P>I want to thank all the great people I've met and worked with during
the time I've served as President of the North Texas Linux Users
Group. They helped inspire me to use Linux full-time. The best thing
about Linux really is the people you meet.
<P>I especially want to thank 
<A HREF="mailto:cbbrowne@hex.net">Chris Browne</A> for describing the situation with
non-profit and charitable groups in Canada, his thoughts on financial
donations as a way to participate in Linux and the free software
movement, and his ideas about the kinds of political issues that may
arise within LUGs.
<P>In addition, the following people have made helpful comments and
suggestions:
