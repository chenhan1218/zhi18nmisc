<H2><A NAME="UPnP_"></A> <A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) </A>
</H2>

<P> This is actually a sort of network plug-and-play developed by
Microsoft but usable by Linux.  You plug something into a network and
that something doesn't need to be configured provided it will only
communicate with other UPnP enabled devices on the network.  Here
configure is used in the broad sense and doesn't mean just configuring
bus-resources.  One objective is to allow people who know little about
networks or configuring to install routers, gateways, network
printers, etc.  A major use for UPnP would be in wireless networking.
<P>UPnP uses:
<UL>
<LI> Simple Service Discovery Protocol to find devices</LI>
<LI> General Event Notification Architecture</LI>
<LI> Simple Object Access Protocol for controlling devices</LI>
</UL>
<P>This HOWTO doesn't cover UPnP.  UPnP for Linux is supported by Intel
which has developed software for it.  There are other programs which
do about the same thing as UPnP.  A comparison of some of them is at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~dchakr1/papers/mcommerce.html">http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~dchakr1/papers/mcommerce.html</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="address_details"></A> <A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Address Details </A>
</H2>

<P> There are three types of addresses: main memory addresses, I/O
addresses and configuration addresses.  On the PCI bus, configuration
addresses constitute a separate address space just like I/O addresses
do.  Except for the complicated case of ISA configuration addresses
whether or not an address on the bus is a memory address, I/O address,
or configuration address depends only on the voltage on other wires
(traces) of the bus.  For the ISA configuration addresses see 
<A HREF="#isa_conf_addresses">ISA Bus Configuration Addresses (Read-Port etc.)</A> for details
<P>
<H3>Address ranges</H3>

<P> The term "address" is sometimes used in this document to mean a
contiguous range of addresses.  Since addresses are in units of bytes,
a single address only contains one byte but I/O (and main memory)
addresses need more than this.  So a range of say 8 bytes is often
used for I/O address while the range for main memory addresses
allocated to a device is much larger.  For a serial port (an I/O
device) it's sufficient to give the starting I/O address of the device
(such as 3F8) since it's well known that the range of addresses for
serial port is only 8 bytes.  The starting address is known as the
"base address".  Sometimes just the word "range" is used to mean
"address range".
<P>
<H3>Address space </H3>

<P> For ISA, to access both I/O and (main) memory address "spaces"
the same address bus is used (the wires used for the address are
shared).  How does the device know whether or not an address which
appears on the address bus is a memory address or I/O address?  Well,
there are 4 dedicated wires on the bus that convey this information
and more.  If a certain one of these 4 wires is asserted, it says that
the CPU wants to read from an I/O address, and the main memory ignores
the address on the bus.  The other 3 wires serve similar purposes.
Thus read and write wires exist for both main memory and I/O addresses
(4 wires in all).  
<P>For the PCI bus it's the same basic idea (also using 4 wires) but it's
done a little differently.  Instead of only one or the four wires
being asserted, a binary number is put on the wires (16 different
possibilities).  Thus more info may be conveyed.   Four of these 16
numbers serve the I/O and memory spaces as in the above paragraph.  In
addition there is also configuration address space which uses up two
more numbers.  Ten extra numbers are left over for other purposes.
<P>
<H3>Range Check (ISA Testing for IO Address Conflicts)</H3>

<P> On the ISA bus, there's a method built into each PnP card for
checking that there are no other cards that use the same I/O address.
If two or more cards use the same IO address, neither card is likely
to work right (if at all).  Good PnP software should assign
bus-resources so as to avoid this conflict, but even in this case a
legacy card might be lurking somewhere with the same address.
<P>The test works by a card putting a test number in its own IO
registers.  Then the PnP software reads it and verifies that it reads
the same test number.  If not, something is wrong (such as another
card with the same address.  It repeats the same test with another
test number.  Since it actually checks the range of IO addresses
assigned to the card, it's called a "range check".  It could be better
called an address-conflict test.  If there is an address conflict you
get an error message and need to resolve it yourself.
<P>
<H3>Communicating Directly via Memory</H3>

<P> Traditionally, most I/O devices used only I/O memory to
communicate with the CPU.  For example, the serial port does this.
The device driver, running on the CPU would read and write data
to/from the I/O address space and main memory.  A faster way would be
for the device itself to put the data directly into main memory.  One
way to do this is by using 
<A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO-2.html#dma_">DMA Channels</A> or bus
mastering.  Another way is to allocate some space in main memory to
the device.  This way the device reads and writes directly to main
memory without having to bother with DMA or bus mastering.  Such
a device may also use IO addresses.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="isa_conf_addresses"></A> <A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 ISA Bus Configuration Addresses (Read-Port etc.)</A>
</H2>

<P> These addresses are also known as the "Auto-configuration Ports".
For the ISA bus, there is technically no configuration address space,
but there is a special way for the CPU to access PnP configuration
registers on the PnP cards.  For this purpose 3 @ I/O addresses are
allocated and each addresses only a single byte (there is no "range").
This is not 3 addresses for each card but 3 addresses shared by all
ISA-PnP cards.
<P>These 3 addresses are named read-port, write-port, and address-port.
Each port is just one byte in size.  Each PnP card has many
configuration registers so that just 3 addresses are not even
sufficient for the configuration registers on a single card.  To solve
this problem, each card is assigned a card number (handle) using a
technique called "isolation".  See 
<A HREF="#isolation_">ISA Isolation</A> for the complex details.
<P>Then to configure a certain card, its card number (handle) is sent 
out via the write-port address to tell that card that it is to listen
at its address port.  All other cards note that this isn't their card
number and thus don't listen.  Then the address of a configuration
register (for that card) is sent to the address-port (for all cards
--but only one is listening).  Next, data transfer takes place with
that configuration register on that card by either doing a read on the
read-port or a write on the write-port.
<P>The write-port is always at A79 and the address-port is always at 279
(hex).  The read-port is not fixed but is set by the configuration
software at some address (in the range 203-3FF) that will hopefully
not conflict with any other ISA card.  If there is a conflict, it will
change the address.  All PnP cards get "programmed" with this address.
Thus if you use say isapnp to set or check configuration data it must
determine this read-port address.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="interrupt_detail"></A> <A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Interrupts --Details </A>
</H2>

<P> Interrupts convey a lot of information but only indirectly.  The
interrupt request signal (a voltage on a wire) just tells a chip
called the interrupt controller that a certain device needs attention.
The interrupt controller then signals the CPU.  The CPU then
interrupts whatever it was doing, finds the driver for this device and
runs a part of it known as an "interrupt service routine" (or
"interrupt handler").  This "routine" tries to find out what has
happened and then deals with the problem.  For example, bytes may need
to be transferred from/to the device.   This program (routine) can
easily find out what has happened since the device has registers at
addresses known to the the driver software (provided the IRQ number
and the I/O address of the device has been set correctly).  These
registers contain status information about the device .  The software
reads the contents of these registers and by inspecting the contents,
finds out what happened and takes appropriate action.
<P>Thus each device driver needs to know what interrupt number (IRQ) to
listen to.  On the PCI bus (and for some special cases on the ISA bus)
it's possible for two (or more) devices to share the same IRQ number.
When such an interrupt is issued, the CPU runs all interrupt service
routines for all devices using that interrupt.  The first thing the
first service routine does is to check its device registers to see if
an interrupt actually happened for its device.  If it finds that its
device didn't issue an interrupt (a false alarm) it likely will
immediately exit and the service routine begins for the second device
using that same interrupt, etc, etc.
<P>The putting of a voltage on the IRQ line is only a request that the
CPU be interrupted so it can run a device driver.  In almost all cases
the CPU is interrupted per the request.  But interrupts may be
temporarily disabled or prioritized so that in rare cases the actual
interrupt doesn't happen (or gets delayed).  Thus what was above
called an "interrupt" is more precisely only an interrupt request
and explains why IRQ stands for Interrupt ReQuest.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 PCI Interrupts</A>
</H2>

<P> There are two newer developments in PCI interrupts that are not
covered here.  They are especially important for cases of more than
one CPU per computer.  One is the Advanced Programmable Interrupt
Controller (APIC).  Another is Message Signalled Interrupts (MSI)
where the interrupt is just a message sent to a special address over
the main computer bus (no interrupt lines needed).  But the device
that sends such a message must first gain control of the main bus so
that it can send the interrupt message.  Such a message contains more
info than just "I'm sending an interrupt".
<P>Ordinary PCI interrupts are different than ISA interrupts, but since
they are normally mapped to IRQ's they behave in about the same way.
One major difference is that the BIOS does this mapping.  Under Linux
it's not feasible to change it ?? unless the CMOS menu will let you do
it.  Another major difference is that PCI interrupts may be shared.
For example IRQ5 may be shared between two PCI devices.  This sharing
ability is built into the hardware and all device drivers are supposed
to support it.  Note that you can't share the same interrupt between
the PCI and ISA bus.  However, illegal sharing will work provided the
devices which are in conflict are not in use at the same time.  "In
use" here means that a program is running which "opened" the device in
its C programming code.  
<P>Here are some of the details of the PCI interrupt system.  Each PCI
card (and device mounted on the motherboard) has 4 possible
interrupts: INTA#, INTB#, INTC#, INTD#.  From now on we may call them
just A, B, C, and D.  Each has its own pin on the edge connector of a
card.  Thus for a 7-slot system there could be 7 x 4 = 28  different
interrupt lines for the cards.  But the specs permit a fewer number of
interrupt lines so many PCI buses seem to be made with only 4
interrupt lines.  This is not too restrictive since interrupts may be
shared.  Call these lines (wires or traces) W, X, Y, Z.  Suppose we
designate the B interrupt from slot 3 as interrupt 3B. 
<P>One simple method of connecting these lines to the interrupts would be
to connect all A interrupts (INTA#) to line W, all B's to X,
etc.  This method was used several years ago but it is not a
good solution.  Here's why.  If a card only needs one interrupt, it's
required that it use A.  If it needs two interrupts, it must use both
A and B, etc.  Thus INTA# is used much more often than INTD#.  So one
winds up with an excessive number of interrupts sharing the first line
(W connected to all the INTA#).  To overcome this problem one may
connect them in a more complicated way so that each of the 4 interrupt
lines (W, X, Y, Z) will share about the same number of interrupts.
<P>One method of doing this would be to have wire W share interrupts 1A,
2B, 3C, 4D, 5A, 6B, 7C.  This is done by physically connecting wire W
to wires 1A, 2B, etc.  Likewise wire X could be connected to wires 1B,
2C, 3D, 4A, 5B, 6C, 7D, etc.  Then on startup, the BIOS maps the X, W,
Y, Z to IRQs.  After that it writes the IRQ that each device uses into
a hardware configuration register in each device.  From then on any
program interrogating this register can find out what IRQ the device
uses.
<P>A card in a slot may have up to 8 devices on it but there are only 4
PCI interrupts for it (A, B, C, D).  This is OK since interrupts may
be shared so that each of the 8 devices (if they exist) can have an
interrupt.  The PCI interrupt letter of a device is often fixed and
hardwired into the device.  The assignment of interrupts is done by
the BIOS mapping the ISA interrupts to the PCI interrupts as mentioned
above.  If there are only 4 lines (W, X, Y, and Z) as in the above
example, the choices the PCI BIOS has are limited.  Some motherboards
may use more lines and thus have more choices.  The BIOS knows about
how this is wired.
<P>The BIOS assigns IRQs (interrupts) so as to avoid conflicts with the
IRQs it knows about on the ISA bus.  Sometimes in the CMOS BIOS menu
one may allow one to assign IRQs to PCI cards. 
<P>You might think that since the PCI is using IRQ's (ISA bus) it might
be slow since the ISA bus is slow.  Not really.  The ISA Interrupt
Controller Chip(s) has a direct interrupt wire going to the CPU so it
can get immediate attention.  While signals on the ISA address and
data buses may be slow to get to the CPU, the IRQ interrupt signals
get there almost instantly.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="isolation_"></A> <A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 ISA Isolation </A>
</H2>

<P> This is only for the ISA bus.  Isolation is a complex method of
assigning a temporary handle (id number or Card Select Number = CSN)
to each PnP device on the ISA bus.  Since there are more efficient
(but more complex) ways to do this, some might claim that it's a
simple method.  Only one write address is used for PnP writes to all
PnP devices so that writing to this address goes to all PnP device
that are listening.  This write address is used to send (assign) a
unique handle to each PnP device.  To assign this handle requires that
only one device be listening when the handle is sent (written) to this
common address.  All PnP devices have a unique serial number which
they use for the process of isolation.  Doing isolation is something
like a game.  It's done using the equivalent of just one common bus
wire connecting all PnP devices to the isolation program.
<P>For the first round of the "game" all PnP devices listen on this wire
and send out simultaneously a sequence of bits to the wire.  The
allowed bits are either a 1 (positive voltage) or an "open 0" of no
voltage (open circuit or tri-state).  To do this, each PnP device just
starts to sequentially send out its serial number on this wire,
bit-by-bit, starting with the high-order bit.  If any device sends a
1, a 1 will be heard on the wire by all other devices.  If all devices
send an "open 0" nothing will be heard on the wire.  The object is to
eliminate (by the end of this first round) all but highest serial
number device.  "Eliminate" means to drop out of this round of the
game and thus temporarily cease to listen anymore to the wire.  (Note
that all serial numbers are of the same length.)  When there remains
only one device still listening, it will be given a handle (card
number).
<P>First consider only the high-order bit of the serial number which is
put on the wire first by all devices which have no handle yet.  If any
PnP device sends out a 0 (open 0) but hears a 1, this means that some
other PnP device has a higher serial number, so it temporarily drops
out of this round.  Now the devices remaining in the game (for this
round) all have the same leading digit (a 1) so we may strip off this
digit and consider only the resulting "stripped serial number" for
future participation in this round.  Then go to the start of this
paragraph and repeat until the entire serial number has been examined
for each device (see below for the all-0 case). 
<P>Thus it's clear that only cards with the lower serial number get
eliminated during a round.  But what happens if all devices in the
game all send out a 0 as their high-order bit?  In this case an "open
0" is sent on the line and all participants stay in the game.  If they
all have a leading 0 then this is a tie and the 0's are stripped off
just like the 1's were in the above paragraph.  The game then
continues as the next digit (of the serial number) is sent out.
<P>At the end of the round (after the low-order bit of the serial number
has been sent out) only one PnP device with the highest serial number
remains in the game.  It then gets assigned a handle and drops out of
the game permanently.  Then all the dropouts from the previous round
(that don't have a handle yet) reenter the game and a new round begins
with one less participant.  Eventually, all PnP devices are assigned
handles.  It's easy to prove that this algorithm works.  The actual
algorithm is a little more complex than that presented above since
each step is repeated twice to ensure reliability and the repeats are
done somewhat differently (but use the same basic idea).
<P>Once all handles are assigned, they are used to address each PnP
device for sending/reading configuration data.  Note that these
handles are only used for PnP configuration and are not used for
normal communication with the PnP device.  When the computer starts
up a PnP BIOS will often do such an isolation and then a PnP
configuration.  After that, all the handles are "lost" so that if one
wants to change (or inspect) the configuration again, the isolation
must be done over again.
