<H2><A NAME="s12">12. Ethics and Licensing Issues Related to Type</A></H2>

<P>Font licensing is a very contentious issue. While it is true 
that there is a wealth of <EM>freely available</EM> fonts, the chances 
are that the fonts are ``ripoffs'' in some sense, unless they come 
with a license indicating otherwise. 
The issue is made more confusing by intellectual property laws regarding
typefaces. Basically, in the USA, font <EM>files </EM> are protected 
by copyright, but <EM>font renderings</EM> are not. In other words,
it's illegal to redistribute fonts, but it's perfectly legal to 
``reverse-engineer'' them by printing them out on graph paper and 
designing the curves to match the printout. Reverse engineered fonts
are typically cheap and freely available, but of poor quality.
These fonts, as well as pirated fonts are often distributed on 
very cheap CDs containing huge amounts of fonts.
So it's not always easy to tell if a font is reverse engineered, or 
simply pirated. This situation creates an enormous headache for 
anyone hoping to package free fonts for Linux.
<P>Perhaps one of the most offensive things about the nature of 
font piracy is that it artificially debases the value of the
work that type designers do. Pirated fonts invariably are bundled
en masse onto these one zillion font CDs, with no due credit given
to the original designers. In contrast, what is commendable 
about several 
legitimate font foundries is that they credit their designers.
<P>There are many differing opinions on this issue. See 
<A HREF="http://www.typeright.org">typeright</A> for 
an explanation of the case in favour of intellectual property rights.
Also, see 
<A HREF="http://www.ssifonts.com/">Southern Software, Inc</A>
for another opinion -- but don't buy any of their fonts! Their Type1 fonts
( poorly reverse-engineered Adobe fonts ) 
do not have AFMs, and are thus unusable. 
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/fonts-faq/part2/">The comp.fonts FAQ</A>
also discusses the issues of fonts and intellectual property,
as does 
<A HREF="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/">Luc Devroye's homepage</A>. These 
references are somewhat less extreme in their views.
