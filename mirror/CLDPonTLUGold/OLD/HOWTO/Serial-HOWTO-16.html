<H2><A NAME="ss16.2">16.2 Signals May Have No Fixed Meaning</A>
</H2>

<P> Only 3 of the 9 pins have a fixed assignment: transmit, receive
and signal ground.  This is fixed by the hardware and you can't change
it.  But the other signal lines are controlled by software and may do
(and mean) almost anything at all.  However they can only be in one of
two states: asserted (+12 volts) or negated (-12 volts).  Asserted is
"on" and negated is "off".  For example, Linux software may command
that DTR be negated and the hardware only carries out this command and
puts -12 volts on the DTR pin.  A modem (or other device) that
receives this DTR signal may do various things.  If a modem has been
configured a certain way it will hang up the telephone line when DTR
is negated.  In other cases it may ignore this signal or do something
else when DTR is negated (turned off).
<P>It's like this for all the 6 signal lines.  The hardware only sends
and receives the signals, but what action (if any) they perform is up
to the Linux software and the configuration/design of devices that you
connect to the serial port.  However, most pins have certain functions
which they normally perform but this may vary with the operating
system and the device driver configuration.  Under Linux, one may
modify the source code to make these signal lines behave differently
(some people have).

<H2><A NAME="cabling_"></A> <A NAME="ss16.3">16.3 Cabling Between Serial Ports </A>
</H2>

<P> A cable from a serial port always connects to another serial port.
An external modem or other device that connects to the serial port has
a serial port built into it.  For modems, the cable is always straight
thru: pin 2 goes to pin 2, etc.  The modem is said to be DCE (Data
Communications Equipment) and the computer is said to be DTE (Data
Terminal Equipment).  Thus for connecting DTE-to-DCE you use
straight-thru cable.  For connecting DTE-to-DTE you must use a
null-modem cable (also called a crossover cable).  There are many ways
to wire such cable (see examples in Text-Terminal-HOWTO subsection:
"Direct Cable Connection")
<P>There are good reasons why it works this way.  One reason is that the
signals are unidirectional.  If pin 2 sends a signal out of it (but is
unable to receive any signal) then obviously you can't connect it to
pin 2 of the same type of device.  If you did, they would both send
out signals on the same wire to each other but neither would be able
to receive any signal.  There are two ways to deal with this
situation.  One way is to have a two different types of equipment
where pin 2 of the first type sends the signal to pin 2 of the second
type (which receives the signal).  That's the way it's done when you
connect a PC (DTE) to a modem (DCE).  There's a second way to do this
without having two different types of equipment: Connect pin sending
pin 2 to a receiving pin 3 on same type of equipment.  That's the way
it's done when you connect 2 PCs together or a PC to a terminal
(DTE-to-DTE).  The cable used for this is called a null-modem cable
since it connects two PCs without use of a modem.  A null-modem cable
may also be called a cross-over cable since the wires between pins 2
and 3 cross over each other (if you draw them on a sheet of paper).
The above example is for a 25 pin connector but for a 9-pin connector
the pin numbers are just the opposite.
<P>The serial pin designations were originally intended for connecting a
dumb terminal to a modem.  The terminal was DTE (Data Terminal
Equipment) and the modem was DCE (Data Communication Equipment).
Today the PC is usually used as DTE instead of a terminal (but real
terminals may still be used this way).  The names of the pins are the
same on both DTE and DCE.  The words: "receive" and "transmit" are
from the "point of view" of the PC (DTE).  The transmit pin from the
PC transmits to the "transmit" pin of the modem (but actually the
modem is receiving the data from this pin so from the point of view of
the modem it would be a receive pin).
<P>The serial port was originally intended to be used for connecting DTE
to DCE which makes cabling simple: just use a straight-thru cable.
Thus when one connects a modem one seldom needs to worry about which
pin is which.  But people wanted to connect DTE to DTE (for example a
computer to a terminal) and various ways were found to do this by
fabricating various types of special null-modem cables.  In this case
what pin connects to what pin becomes significant.

<H2><A NAME="rts_cts"></A> <A NAME="ss16.4">16.4 RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR Flow Control </A>
</H2>

<P> This is "hardware" flow control.  Flow control was previously
explained in the 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-3.html#flow_control">Flow Control</A>
subsection but the pins and voltage signals were not.  Linux only
supports RTS/CTS flow control at present (but a special driver may
exist for a specific application which supports DTR/DSR flow control).
Only RTS/CTS flow control will be discussed since DTR/DSR flow control
works the same way.  To get RTS/CTS flow control one needs to either
select hardware flow control in an application program or use the
command:<BR> 
stty crtscts &lt; /dev/ttyS2 (or the like).  This enables RTS/CTS
hardware flow control in the Linux device driver.
<P>Then when a DTE (such as a PC) wants to stop the flow into it, it
negates RTS.  Negated "Request To Send" (-12 volts) means "request NOT
to send to me" (stop sending).  When the PC is ready for more bytes
it asserts RTS (+12 volts) and the flow of bytes to it resumes.  Flow
control signals are always sent in a direction opposite to the flow of
bytes that is being controlled.  DCE equipment (modems) works the same
way but sends the stop signal out the CTS pin.  Thus it's RTS/CTS flow
control using 2 lines.
<P>On what pins is this stop signal received?  That depends on whether we
have a DCE-DTE connection or a DTE-DTE connection.  For DCE-DTE it's a
straight-thru connection so obviously the signal is received on a pin
with the same name as the pin it's sent out from.  It's RTS-->RTS (PC
to modem) and CTS&lt;--CTS (modem to PC).  For DTE-to-DTE the connection
is also easy to figure out.  The RTS pin always sends and the CTS pin
always receives.  Assume that we connect two PCs (PC1 and PC2)
together via their serial ports.  Then it's RTS(PC1)-->CTS(PC2) and
CTS(PC1)&lt;--RTS(PC2).  In other words RTS and CTS cross over.  Such a
cable (with other signals crossed over as well) is called a "null
modem" cable.  See 
<A HREF="#cabling_">Cabling Between Serial Ports</A><P>What is sometimes confusing is that there is the original use of RTS
where it means about the opposite of the previous explanation above.
This original meaning is: I Request To Send to you.  This request was
intended to be sent from a terminal (or computer) to a modem which, if
it decided to grant the request, would send back an asserted CTS from
its CTS pin to the CTS pin of the computer: You are Cleared To Send to
me.  Note that in contrast to the modern RTS/CTS bi-directional flow
control, this only protects the flow in one direction: from the
computer (or terminal) to the modem.  This original use appears to be
little used today on modern equipment (including modems).
<P>
<H3>The DTR and DSR Pins</H3>

<P> Just like RTS and CTS, these pins are paired.  For DTE-to-DTE
connections they are likely to cross over.  There are two ways to use
these pins.  One way is to use them as a substitute for RTS/CTS flow
control.  The DTR pin is just like the RTS pin while the DSR pin
behaves like the CTS pin.  Although Linux doesn't support DTR/DSR flow
control, it can be obtained by connecting the RTS/CTS pins at the PC
to the DSR/DTR pins at the device that uses DTR/DSR flow control.  DTR
flow control is the same as DTR/DSR flow control but it's only one-way
and only uses the DTR pin at the device.  Many text terminals and some
printers use DTR/DSR (or just DTR) flow control.  In the future, Linux
may support DTR/DSR flow control.  The software has already been
written but it's not clear when (or if) it will incorporated into the
serial driver.
<P>The normal use of DTR and DSR (not for flow control) is as follows: A
device asserting DTR says that its powered on and ready to operate.
For a modem, the meaning of a DTR signal from the PC depends on how
the modem is configured.  Negating DTR is sometimes called "hanging
up" but it doesn't always do this.  One way to "hang up" (negate DTR)
is to set the baud rate to 0 using the command "stty 0".
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss16.5">16.5 Preventing a Port From Opening</A>
</H2>

<P> If "stty -clocal" (or getty is used with the "local" flag negated)
then a serial port can't open until DCD gets an assert (+12 volts)
signal.
