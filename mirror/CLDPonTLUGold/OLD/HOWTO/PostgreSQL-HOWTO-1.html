<P>The purpose of this document is to provide comprehensive list of pointers/URLs to 
quickly setup PostgreSQL 
and also to advocate the benefits of Open 
Source Code system like PostgreSQL, Linux.
<P>PostgreSQL is pronounced as Post-gres-cue-el (Postgres-QL) and <B>not</B> Postgre-es-cue-el.
<P>Each and every computer system in the world needs a database to store/retrieve the information.
The primary reason you use the computer is to store, retrieve and process information and do all these very quickly, thereby saving you time. 
At the same time, the system must be simple, robust, fast, reliable, economical and very easy to use.
Database is the most <B>VITAL SYSTEM</B> as it stores mission critical information of every company in this world. 
Each and every industry in this world needs a database system. Industries like telecom, automobile, banks, airlines, etc.. 
will not function efficiently without a database system.
The most popular database systems are based on the International Standard Organisation (ISO) SQL 
specifications and ANSI SQL (American) standards.
The current specifications widely used in the industry are ISO/ANSI SQL 1992. 
Upcoming standard is the SQL 1998/99 which is also called SQL-3 is still under development. Popular database like Oracle, Sybase and Informix systems are based on these standards or are 
trying to implement these standards.
<P>Without a standard like ANSI/ISO SQL, it would be very difficult for the customer to develop an application once and run on all the database systems. 
End user wants to develop an application ONCE using ISO SQL, ODBC, JDBC and 
deploy on all variety of database systems in the world.
<P>The world's most popular FREE Database which implements some of the ISO SQL, 
ANSI SQL/98, SQL/92 and ANSI SQL/89 RDBMS is PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is next generation 
Object relational database and is targeting on full compliance of SQL standards like ISO/ANSI SQL.
PostgreSQL is the only free RDBMS in the world which supports Object databases and SQL. This 
document will tell you how-to install the database, how to set 
up the Web database, application database, front end GUIs and interface programs.
It is strongly advised that you MUST write your database applications 100 % 
compliant to standards of ISO/ANSI SQL, ODBC, JDBC so that your application 
is portable across multiple databases like PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix etc.
<P>You get the highest quality, and lot many features with PostgreSQL as it follows 'Open Source Code development model'. Open Source Code model is the one where the complete source code is given to you and the development takes place on the internet by an extremely vast network of human brains.
Future trend shows that most of the software development will take place on the so called "Information Super-Highway" which spans the whole globe.
In the coming years, internet growth will be explosive which will further fuel rapid adoption of 
PostgreSQL by the industry.
<P>By applying the principles of statistics, mathematics and science to software quality, you get the best quality of software only in a 'Open Source Code System' like PostgreSQL, wherein the source code is open to a very vast number of human brains inter-connected by the information super-highway.
Greater the number of human brains working, the better will be the quality of software.
Open Source Code model will also prevent <B>RE-INVENTION OF WHEELS</B>, eliminates <B>DUPLICATION OF WORK</B> and will be very economical, saves time in distribution and follows the modern economic laws of optimizing the national and global resources.
Once a software work is done by others, then you <B>DO NOT</B> need to re-do that again. You will not be wasting your valuable time on something which had already been <B>WELL DONE</B>.
Your time is extremely precious and it must be utilized efficiently, because you have only
8 hours a day for doing work.
As we will be entering the 21st century, there will be a change in the way that you get software for your use.
Everybody will give first preference for the open source 
softwares like PostgreSQL, Linux.
<P>If you buy binaries, you will not get any equity and ownership of source code. Source code is a 
very valuable asset and binaries have no value. Buying software <I>may</I> become a 
thing of the past. You only need to buy good
hardware, it is worth spending money on the hardware and get the software from
internet. Important point is that it is the computer hardware which is 
<B>doing bulk of the work</B>. 
Hardware is the real work horse and software
is just driving it.
Computer hardware is so much more complex that only 6 nations in the world so far have
demonstrated the capability of designing and manufacturing computer chips/hardware. 
Design and manufacturing of computer chips is an advanced technology.
It is a very complex process, capital intensive, requires large investments in plant and
production machines which deal with 0.18 micron (even smaller than 0.18) technology. On a single small silicon 
chip millions of transistors/circuits are densely packed.
Companies like Applied Material, AMD, Intel, Cyrix, Hitachi, IBM and others 
spent significant number of man-years
to master the high-technology like Chip Design, Micro-electronics and Nano-electronics.
Micro means (one-millionth of meter 10^-6),
Nano  means (one-billionth of meter 10^-9). Current technology uses 
micro-electronics of about 0.35 micron using aluminum as conductors and 
0.25 micron sizes using copper as conductors of electrons. 
In near future the technology of 0.10 micron with copper and 
even nano-electronics will be used to make computer chips. Aluminum conductors will be
phased out by copper on computer chips, as copper is a better conductor of electrons.
In photolithography process extreme ultraviolet, X-ray or electron-beam techniques
will be used to etch circuits for feature size less than 0.15 micron.
In about 20 years from now, silicon chips will be phased out by 
molecular computers and bio chips which will be billions of times faster than 
silicon chips. Molecules are a group of atoms. And atoms are tiny particles which 
makes up everything that you see in this world. Molecular computers will 
use the molecules of matter as ultra-fast electronic on/off 
switches. When the switch is ON it indicates 1, 
and when it is OFF it indicates 0. All the computer programs in 
this world are based on binary (numbers 1 and 0).
Table below shows the progress and future advancement trends 
of computer chips.

As you can see, it is hardware that is high technology 
and important and software is labor intensive but is a less difficult technology.
<P>On other hand, each and every country in the world develops/makes software.
In fact, any person in this world with a small low-cost PC can
write software. 
<P>Databases like Oracle, Informix, Sybase, IBM DB2 (Unix) are written using the 
"C" language and binaries are created by compiling the source code
and then they are shipped out to customers. Oracle, Sybase, Informix databases are
100 % "C" programs!!
<P>
<P>Since a lot of work had been done on PostgreSQL for the past 14 years, it does
not make
sense to re-create from scratch another database system which satisfies ANSI/ISO SQL.
It will be a great advantage to take the existing code and add 
missing features or enhancements to PostgreSQL and start using it immediately.
<P>Prediction is that demand for "Internet products" like PostgreSQL will 
grow exponentially as it is capable of 
maintaining a high quality, low cost, extremely large user-base and
developer-base. Those nations which do not use the 'Internet products' 
will be seriously missing "World-wide Internet Revolution" and will be
left far behind other countries. The reason is "Internet" itself is the world's
<B>LARGEST</B> "software company" and is a large software "power house"!
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Quantum Computers - Quantum Physics Useful !!</A>
</H2>

<P>As you can see from above table "Advancement of chip capabilities in future"
in the years after 2030, database systems like PostgreSQL will be running on
<B>Quantum Computers</B>. Quantum Computers rely on an atomic particle's traits,
such as direction of spin, for creating a state. For example, when the spin
is up, a particle could be read as <B>"one"</B>, when its spin is down, the  particle
would be read as <B>"zero"</B>. Atoms and nuclei can exist in a state of superposition,
where the values of one, zero and the range in between can be represented
concurrently. By entangling the spins of atoms, <B>"qubits"</B> can become wired 
together, enabling them to function as a collective whole, bringing about a
nonlinear computational power that <B>far surpasses</B> the capabilities
of supercomputers available today!! At atomic level Quantum Physics comes 
to assistance to better understand the behaviour of atomic particles.
