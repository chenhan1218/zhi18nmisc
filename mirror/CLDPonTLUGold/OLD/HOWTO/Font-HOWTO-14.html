<LI><B>afm</B> 
Stands for <B>Adobe Font Metric</B>. These files store information about
the width and spacing associated with the font, as opposed to information
about the font shape.
</LI>
<LI><B>anti-aliasing</B>
also referred to as font smoothing is a technique
used to render fonts on low resolution devices ( such as a monitor ). 
The problem with rendering fonts is that the fonts consist of outlines,
but the device renders in dots. The obvious way to render a font is 
to color black any pixel inside the outline, and leave all other dots. 
The problem with this is that it doesn't adequately address the pixels that
are on the outline. A smarter algorithm would be to color the boundary pixels
gray. Anti-aliasing essentially involves doing this.
</LI>
<LI><B>bdf</B> fonts are a variety of bit-mapped fonts that may be 
used with X.
</LI>
<LI><B>bitmap fonts</B>
These fonts are simply a collection of dots. Each character of 
the font is stored as a dot matrix. Because of this, bitmap fonts 
are device dependent, so you can't use the same bitmap fonts on 
a screen and a printer. Examples of bitmap screen fonts include 
.pcf and .bdf fonts used by X. Examples of printer bitmap 
fonts include TeX's PK fonts.
</LI>
<LI><B>didone</B> see modern.
</LI>
<LI><B>DPI</B>
Dots Per Inch. Monitors typically display at 75-100 DPI, while 
modern printers vary from 300-1200 DPI
</LI>
<LI><B>expert fonts</B> are collections of additional characters
that supplement a font. They include small caps fonts, ornaments,
extra ligatures, and variable width digits. Many of Adobe's fonts 
have expert fonts available.
</LI>
<LI><B>font server</B>
a background program that makes fonts available to XFree86.
</LI>
<LI><B>glyph</B> A glyph is a fancy word for a shape. It is a component
that makes up an outline font. For example, the dot on the letter
``i'' is a glyph, as is the vertical line, as are the serifs. Glyphs
determine the shape of the font.
</LI>
<LI><B>kerning</B> In variable width fonts, different pairs of characters 
are spaced differently. The font metric files store information regarding 
spacing between pairs of characters, called <B>kerning pairs</B>.
</LI>
<LI><B>ligature</B> A ligature is a special character that is used
to represent a sequence of characters. This is best explained by example 
-- when the letter fi are rendered, the dot on the ``i'' collides
with the ``f'', and the serif on the top left of the i can also 
collide with the horizontal stroke of the f. The fi ligature is a 
single character that can be used in the place of a single f followed
by a single i. There are also ligatures for fl, ffi, and ffl. 
Most fonts only include the fi and fl ligatures. The other ligatures
may be made available in an <B>expert font</B>.

</LI>
<LI><B>metafont</B> 
A graphics language used for creating fonts. Metafont has a lot of nice
features, the main one being that fonts created with metafont need not
just scale linearly. That is, a 17 point computer modern font 
generated by metafont is not the same as a magnified 10 point 
computer modern font. Prior to Adobe's multiple master technology,
metafont was unique with respect to having this feature.
Metafonts main advantage is that it produces high quality fonts. 
The disadvantage is that generating bitmaps from the outline fonts 
is slow, so they aren't feasible 
for WYSIWYG publishing.
</LI>
<LI><B>metric</B> this stores information about how much space a font 
takes up. A font metric is like a box that one can embed the font in. Font 
metrics are essential for the purpose of laying out fonts on a page, while the 
font shape itself is not. So typically, variable width fonts have metric 
information as well as shape information. The metric also includes kerning 
information.
</LI>
<LI><B>modern</B> fonts are fonts based on designs developed in the
19th century or later. The moderns have a solid appearance due to 
their vertical stress. They tend to have more ``character'' or 
``attitude'' than the old styles and transitionals, but still carry
a certain amount of dignity and formality.
They are not suited for writing long passages, but they are useful
for adding character to a piece of writing.
Bodoni is a notable modern typeface.
</LI>
<LI><B>old style</B> fonts are a traditional class of typeface. 
The old style fonts are based on designs from as far back as the late
15th century. Old style fonts are great for writing long documents
( such as books ). While the old style fonts are designed in the 
tradition of the earlier designers, some of them were designed 
quite recently. Notably, the face <B>Goudy Old Style</B> was
designed by Goudy in the early 20th century. Notable old style
faces include Goudy Old Style, Garamond, and Caslon.
</LI>
<LI><B>pcf</B> fonts are bit-mapped fonts used by X.
</LI>
<LI><B>postscript</B> is a programming language designed for page description.
Postscript was a trademark of it's inventor, adobe. However, it is also an 
ISO standard. Postscript needs an 
interpreter to render it. This can be done 
via a program on the computer, such as ghostscript, or it can be interpreted 
by some printers.
</LI>
<LI><B>serif</B> fonts are fonts with 
little hooks ( called serifs ) on the ends of the font.
the serifs usually help make the font more readable. 
However, serifs are quite
difficult to render on low resolution devices, especially at small font 
sizes ( because they are a fine detail ), so it is often true 
that at small sizes on low resolution devices, sans serif fonts 
( such as Microsoft's Verdana ) prove more readable. Another issue
is that there are sans serif fonts ( like the moderns ) that are
not designed for writing long documents.
</LI>
<LI><B>sans serif</B> fonts are fonts without serifs ( sans is French 
for ``without'' ). These fonts have a stark appearance, and are well
suited for writing headlines. While textbook typography mandates that 
serif fonts be used just for headlines, they can have other uses. 
There are sans serif fonts designed for readability as opposed to
impact.
Short punchy documents that are skimmed ( such as catalogues and 
marketting brochures ) may use them, and recently, Microsoft have made
available the Verdana font which is designed for readability at small
sizes on low resolution devices.
Well known sans serif fonts include Lucida Sans, MS Comic Sans,
Avant Garde, Arial, Verdana, Century Gothic.
</LI>
<LI><B>slab serif</B> fonts are a certain class of font whose serifs
look like slabs ( eg flat lines or blocks ) and not hooks.
Slab serif fonts are <B>often</B>, but not always very readable.
Because the serifs are simple and strong, they give one the feeling 
that they have been punched into the page. 
Well known examples of slab serifs are Clarendon, New 
Century Schoolbook, and Memphis.
</LI>
<LI><B>transitional</B> fonts are fonts that are based on more 
recent designs than the old style fonts. many of the transitional 
fonts have good readability. Notable transitionals include Baskerville,
and Times Roman.
</LI>
<LI><B>Type1</B> is a type of font designed by Adobe. These fonts are
well supported by almost all linux applications, because they have been
supported by the X server architecture and the postscript standard for
a long time. Postscript fonts are distributed in many different 
formats. Typically, a UNIX postscript font is distributed as
an <CODE>afm</CODE> ( adobe font metric ) file, and an outline file, which is 
usually a <CODE>.pfb</CODE> ( printer font binary ) or 
<CODE>.pfa</CODE> ( printer font ascii ) file. The outline file contains 
all the glyphs, while the metric file contains the metrics.
</LI>
<LI><B>type3</B> fonts are similar to Type1. The file extensions
are similar to Type1 fonts ( they are distributed as <CODE>pfa</CODE> and
<CODE>afm</CODE> files ), but they are not supported by X, and because
of this, there are not very many linux applications which support them.
