<P>This document is a guide to getting your busmouse working with
Linux.  With the more advanced distributions available today setting up
your busmouse is generally easy but when you do run into
problems this document will help give you a better understanding of
how to manually setup your busmouse hardware and software.
<P>Busmouse support has been in the kernel for as long as I can
remember, and hasn't changed much in a long time, so this document
should be relevant to any version of Linux you're likely to have.
