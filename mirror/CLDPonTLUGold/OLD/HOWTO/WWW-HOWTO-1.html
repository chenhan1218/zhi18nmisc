<P>
<P>Many people are trying Linux because they are looking for a 
really good <EM>Internet capable</EM> operating system. 
Also, there are institutes, universities, non-profits, and small
businesses which want to set up Internet sites on a
small budget. This is where the WWW-HOWTO comes in. This document 
explains how to set up clients and servers for the largest 
part of the Internet - <EM>The World Wide Web</EM>. 
<P>All prices in this document are stated in US dollars.  This document
assumes you are running Linux on an Intel platform.  Instructions and
product availability my vary from platform to platform.  There are many
links for downloading software in this document.  Whenever possible use a
mirror site for faster downloading and to keep the load down on the main
server.
