<H2><A NAME="cant_find_modem"></A> <A NAME="ss17.1">17.1 My Modem is Physically There but Can't be Found </A>
</H2>

<P> The error messages could be something like "No modem detected",
"Modem not responding", or (strange) "You are already online" (from
Minicom).  If you have installed an internal modem (serial port is
builtin) or are using an external one and don't know what serial port
it's connected to then the problem is to find the serial port.  See
<A HREF="#cant_find_port">My Serial Port is Physically There but Can't be Found</A>.  This section is about finding out which serial port
has the modem on it.
<P>There's a program that looks for modems on commonly used serial ports
called "wvdialconf".  Just type "wvdialconf &lt;a-new-file-name&gt;".
It will create the new file as a configuration file but you don't need
this file unless you are going to use "wvdial" for dialing.
See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#wvdial_">What is wvdialconf ?</A>  Unfortunately, if
your modem is in "online data" mode, wvdialconf will report "No modem
detected"  See 
<A HREF="#no_AT">No response to AT</A><P>Your problem could be due to a winmodem (or the like) which usually
can't be used with Linux.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-2.html#soft_modem">Software-based Modems (winmodems)</A>.  The "setserial program may
be used to detect serial ports but will not detect modems on them.
Thus "wvdialconf" is best to try first.
<P>Another way try to find out if there's a modem on a port is to start
"minicom" on the port (after first setting up minicom for the correct
serial port --you will need to save the setup and then exit minicom
and start it again).  Then type "AT" and you should see OK (or 0 if
it's set for "digit result codes").  The results may be: 
<UL>
<LI> No response.  See 
<A HREF="#no_AT">No response to AT</A></LI>
<LI> It takes many seconds to get an expected truncated response
(including only the cursor moving down one line).  See 
<A HREF="#slow_">Extremely Slow: Text appears on the screen slowly after long delays</A></LI>
<LI> Some strange characters appear but they are not in response to
AT.  This likely means that your modem is still connected to something
at the other end of the phone line which is sending some cryptic
packets or the like.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="no_AT"></A> No response to AT </H3>

<P> The modem should send you "OK" in response to your "AT" which you
type to the modem (using minicom or the like).  If you don't see "OK"
(and in most cases don't even see the "AT" you typed either) then the
modem is not responding (often because what you type doesn't even get
to the modem).  
<P>A common cause is that there is no modem on the serial port you are
typing to.  For the case of an internal modem, that serial port likely
doesn't exist either.  That's because the PnP modem card (which has a
built-in serial port) has either not been configured (by isapnp or the
like) or has been configured incorrectly.  See 
<A HREF="#cant_find_port">My Serial Port is Physically There but Can't be Found</A>.  
<P>If what you type is really getting thru to a modem, then the lack of
response could be due to the modem being in "online data" mode where
it can't accept any AT commands.  You may have been using the modem
and then abruptly disconnected (such as killing the process with
signal 9).  In that case your modem did not get reset to "command
mode" where it can interact to AT commands.  Thus the message from
minicom "You are already online.  Hangup first."  Well, you are sort
of online but you are may not be connected to anything over the phone
line.  Wvdial will report "modem not responding" for the same
situation.
<P>To fix this as a last resort you could reboot the computer.  Another
way to try to fix this is to send +++ to the modem to tell it to
escape back to "command mode" from "online data mode".  On both sides
of the +++ sequence there must be about 1 second of delay (nothing
sent during "guard time").  This may not work if another process is
using the modem since the +++ sequence could wind up with other
characters inserted in between them or after the +++ (during the guard
time).  Ironically, even if the modem line is idle, typing an
unexpected +++ is likely to set off an exchange of control packets
(that you never see) that will violate the required guard time so
that the +++ doesn't do what you wanted.  +++ is usually in the string
that is named "hangup string" so if you command minicom (or the like)
to hangup it might work.  Another way to do this is to just exit
minicom and then run minicom again.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.2">17.2 "Modem is busy"</A>
</H2>

<P> What this means depends on what program sent it.  The modem could
actually be in use (busy).  Another cause reported for the SuSE
distribution is that there may be two serial drivers present instead
of one.  One driver was built into the kernel and the second was a
module.
<P>In kppp, this message is sent when an attempt to get/set the serial
port parameters fails.  These parameters are the one you see if you
give the "stty -a" command.  It's similar to the "Input/output error"
one may get when trying to use "stty -F /dev/ttySx".  Although the
port is already opened when you see this message, I think it's
possible to open a non-existent device (or one with the wrong IRQ or
IO address).  Now getting certain port parameters (such as the speed)
means communicating with the serial port hardware.  So this error
message may mean that there is no serial port there (or that the
modem's serial port has an incorrect (or no) IRQ or I0 address.  It
could be a wrong ttySx number.  If /dev/modem is used it should be
linked to the correct ttySx.  In these cases the error message should
have said: "Modem can't be found" which really means that it's serial
port (often built into the modem) can't be found.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.3">17.3 I can't get near 56k on my 56k modem</A>
</H2>

<P> There must be very low noise on the line for it to work at even
close to 56k.  Some phone lines are so bad that the speeds obtainable
are much slower than 56k (like 28.8k or even slower).  Sometimes
extension phones connected to the same line can cause problems.  To
test this you might connect your modem directly at the point where the
telephone line enters the building with the feeds for everything else
on that line disconnected (if others can tolerate such a test).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.4">17.4 Uploading (downloading) files is broken/slow </A>
</H2>

<P> Flow control (both at your PC and/or modem-to-modem) may not be
enabled.  For the uploading case: If you have set a high DTE speed
(like 115.2k) then flow from your modem to your PC may work OK but
uploading flow in the other direction will not all get thru due to the
telephone line bottleneck.  This will result in many errors and the
resending of packets.  It may thus take far too long to send a file.
In some cases, files don't make it thru at all.  
<P>For the downloading case: If you're downloading long uncompressed
files or web pages (and your modem uses data compression) or if you've
set a low DTE speed, then downloading may also be broken due to no
flow control.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.5">17.5 For Dial-in I Keep Getting "line NNN of inittab invalid"</A>

<P>Make sure you are using the correct syntax for your version of

<H2><A NAME="ss17.6">17.6 I Keep Getting: ``Id "S3" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes''</A>
</H2>

<P> Id "S3" is just an example.  In this case look on the line which
starts with "S3" in <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE> and calls getty.  This line
causes the problem.  Make sure the syntax for this line is correct and
that the device (ttyS3) exists and can be found.  If the modem has
negated CD and getty opens the port, you'll get this error message
since negated CD will kill getty.  Then getty will respawn only to be
killed again, etc.  Thus it respawns over and over (too fast).  It
seems that if the cable to the modem is disconnected or you have the
wrong serial port, it's just like CD is negated.  All this can occur
when your modem is chatting with getty.  Make sure your modem is
configured correctly.  Look at AT commands <CODE>E</CODE> and <CODE>Q</CODE>.  
<P>
<P>If you use uugetty, verify that your <CODE>/etc/gettydefs</CODE> syntax is
correct by doing the following:

<P>This can happen when your modem doesn't reset when DTR is dropped. 
Greg Hankins saw his RD and SD LEDs go crazy when this happened.
You need to have your modem reset.  Most Hayes compatible modems do
this with <CODE>&amp;D3</CODE>, but for USR Courier, SupraFax, and other
modems, you must set <CODE>&amp;D2</CODE> (and <CODE>S13=1</CODE> for USR Courier).

</H2>

<H2><A NAME="cant_find_port"></A> <A NAME="ss17.10">17.10 My Serial Port is Physically There but Can't be Found </A>
</H2>

<P> If a physical device (such as a modem) doesn't work at all it may
mean that the device is not at the I/O address that setserial
thinks it's at.  It could also mean (for a PnP card) that is doesn't
yet have an address.  Thus it can't be found.  
<P>Check the BIOS menus and BIOS messages.  For the PCI bus use lspci or
scanpci.  If it's an ISA bus PnP serial port, try "pnpdump --dumpregs"
and/or see Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.  Using "scanport" will scan all ISA
bus ports and may discover an unknown port that could be a serial port
(but it doesn't probe the port).  It could hang your PC.  You may try
probing with setserial.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#probing_ss">Probing</A>.  If
nothing seems to get thru the port it may be accessible but have a bad
interrupt.  See 
<A HREF="#slow_">Extremely Slow: Text appears on the screen slowly after long delays</A>.  Use <CODE>setserial -g</CODE> to
see what the serial driver thinks and check for IRQ and I0 address
conflicts.  Even if you see no conflicts the driver may have incorrect
information (view it by "setserial" and conflicts may still exist.
<P>If two ports have the same IO address then probing it will erroneously
indicate only one port.  Plug-and-play detection will find both ports
so this should only be a problem if at least one port is not
plug-and-play.  All sorts of errors may be reported/observed for
devices illegally "sharing" a port but the fact that there are two
devices on the same a port doesn't seem to get detected (except
hopefully by you).  In the above case, if the IRQs are different then
probing for IRQs with setserial might "detect" this situation by
failing to detect any IRQ.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#probing_ss">Probing</A>. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="slow_"></A> <A NAME="ss17.11">17.11 Extremely Slow: Text appears on the screen slowly after long delays  </A>
</H2>

<P> It's likely mis-set/conflicting interrupts.  Here are some of the
symptoms which will happen the first time you try to use a modem,
terminal, or serial printer.  In some cases you type something but
nothing appears on the screen until many seconds later.  Only the last
character typed may show up.  It may be just an invisible
&lt;return&gt; character so all you notice is that the cursor jumps
down one line.  In other cases where a lot of data should appear on
the screen, only a batch of about 16 characters appear.  Then there is
a long wait of many seconds for the next batch of characters.  You
might also get "input overrun" error messages (or find them in logs).
<P>For more details on the symptoms and why this happens see
the Serial-HOWTO section: "Interrupt Problem Details".
<P>If it involves Plug-and-Play devices, see also Plug-and-Play-HOWTO. 
<P>As a quick check to see if it really is an interrupt problem, set the
IRQ to 0 with "setserial".  This will tell the driver to use
polling instead of interrupts.  If this seems to fix the "slow"
problem then you had an interrupt problem.  You should still try to
solve the problem since polling uses excessive computer resources.
<P>Checking to find the interrupt conflict may not be easy since Linux
supposedly doesn't permit any interrupt conflicts and will send you a
<A HREF="#busy_err">/dev/ttyS?: Device or resource busy</A> error
message if it thinks you are attempting to create a conflict.  But a
real conflict can be created if "setserial" has told the kernel
incorrect info.  The kernel has been lied to and thus doesn't think
there is any conflict.  Thus using "setserial" will not reveal the
conflict (nor will looking at /proc/interrupts which bases its info on
"setserial").  You still need to know what "setserial" thinks so that
you can pinpoint where it's wrong and change it when you determine
what's really set in the hardware.
<P>What you need to do is to check how the hardware is set by checking
jumpers or using PnP software to check how the hardware is actually
set.  For PnP run either "pnpdump --dumpregs" (if ISA bus) or run
"lspci" (if PCI bus).  Compare this to how Linux (e.g. "setserial")
thinks the hardware is set.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.12">17.12 Somewhat Slow: I expected it to be a few times faster</A>
</H2>

<P> One reason may be that whatever is on the serial port (such as a
modem, terminal, printer) doesn't work as fast as you thought it did.
A 56k Modem seldom works at 56k and the Internet often has
congestion and bottlenecks that slow things down.  If the modem on the
other end does not have a digital connection to the phone line (and
uses a special "digital modem" not sold in most computer stores), then
speeds above 33.6k are not possible.
<P>Another possible reason is that you have an obsolete serial port: UART
8250, 16450 or early 16550 (or the serial driver thinks you do).  See
"What are UARTS" in the Serial-HOWTO. 
<P>Use "setserial -g /dev/ttyS*".
If it shows anything less than a 16550A, this may be your problem.
If you think that "setserial" has it wrong check it out.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#set_serial">What is Setserial</A> for more info.  If you
really do have an obsolete serial port, lying about it to setserial
will only make things worse.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="irqs_shown_wrong"></A> <A NAME="ss17.13">17.13 The Startup Screen Show Wrong IRQs for the Serial Ports.</A>
 </H2>

<P> Linux does not do any IRQ detection on startup.  When the serial
module loads it only does serial device detection.  Thus, disregard
what it says about the IRQ, because it's just assuming the standard
IRQs.  This is done, because IRQ detection is unreliable, and can be
fooled.  But if and when setserial runs from a start-up script, it
changes the IRQ's and displays the new (and hopefully correct) state
on on the startup screen.  If the wrong IRQ is not corrected by a
later display on the screen, then you've got a problem.
<P>So, even though I have my <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> set at IRQ 5, I still see
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ttyS02 at 0x03e8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

at first when Linux boots.  (Older kernels may show "ttyS02" as
"tty02" which is the same as ttyS2).  You may need to use
<CODE>setserial</CODE> to tell Linux the IRQ you are using. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.14">17.14 "Cannot open /dev/ttyS?: Permission denied"</A>
</H2>

<P> Check the file permissions on this port with "ls -l /dev/ttyS?"_
If you own the ttyS? then you need read and write permissions: crw
with the c (Character device) in col. 1.  It you don't own it then it
should show rw- in cols. 8 &amp; 9 which means that everyone has read and
write permission on it.  Use "chmod" to change permissions.  There are
more complicated ways to get access like belonging to a "group" that
has group permission.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.15">17.15 "Operation not supported by device" for ttyS?</A>
</H2>

<P> This means that an operation requested by setserial, stty, etc.
couldn't be done because the kernel doesn't support doing it.
Formerly this was often due to the "serial" module not being loaded.
But with the advent of PnP, it may likely mean that there is no modem
(or other serial device) at the address where the driver (and
setserial) thinks it is.  If there is no modem there, commands (for
operations) sent to that address obviously don't get done.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-6.html#io-irq_in_hdw">What is set in my serial port hardware?</A><P>If the "serial" module wasn't loaded but "lsmod" shows you it's now
loaded it might be the case that it's loaded now but wasn't loaded
when you got the error message.  In many cases the module will
automatically loaded when needed (if it can be found).  To force
loading of the "serial" module it may be listed in the file:
/etc/modules.conf or /etc/modules.  The actual module should reside
in: /lib/modules/.../misc/serial.o.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.16">17.16 "Cannot create lockfile. Sorry"</A>
</H2>

<P> When a port is "opened" by a program a lockfile is created in
/var/lock/.  Wrong permissions for the lock directory will not allow a
lockfile to be created there.  Use "ls -ld /var/lock" to see if the
permissions are OK: usually rwx for everyone (repeated 3 times).  If
it's wrong, use "chmod" to fix it.  Of course, if there is no "lock"
directory no lockfile can be created there.  For more info on
lockfiles see the Serial-HOWTO subsection: "What Are Lock
Files". 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.17">17.17 "Device /dev/ttyS? is locked."</A>
</H2>

<P> This means that someone else (or some other process) is supposedly
using the serial port.  There are various ways to try to find out what
process is "using" it.  One way is to look at the contents of the
lockfile (/var/lock/LCK...).  It should be the process id.  If the
process id is say 100 type "ps 100" to find out what it is.  Then if
the process is no longer needed, it may be gracefully killed by "kill
100".  If it refuses to be killed use "kill -9 100" to force it to be
killed, but then the lockfile will not be removed and you'll need to
delete it manually.  Of course if there is no such process as 100 then
you may just remove the lockfile but in most cases the lockfile should
have been automatically removed if it contained a stale process id
(such as 100).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="busy_err"></A> <A NAME="ss17.18">17.18 "/dev/tty? Device or resource busy" </A>
</H2>

<P> This means that the device you are trying to access (or use) is
supposedly busy (in use) or that a resource it needs (such as an IRQ)
is supposedly being used by another device (the resource is "busy").
This message is easy to understand if it only means that the device is
busy (in use).  But it often means that a resource is in use.  What
makes it even more confusing is that in some cases neither the device
not the resources that it needs are actually "busy".
<P>The ``resource busy'' part often means (example for <CODE>ttyS2</CODE>) ``You
can't use <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> since another device is using ttyS2's
interrupt.'' The potential interrupt conflict is inferred from what
"setserial" thinks.  A more accurate error message would be ``Can't
use <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> since the setserial data (and kernel data) indicates
that another device is using <CODE>ttyS2</CODE>'s interrupt''.  If two devices
use the same IRQ and you start up only one of the devices, everything
is OK because there is no conflict yet.  But when you next try to
start the second device (without quitting the first device) you get a
"... busy" error message.  This is because the kernel only keeps track
of what IRQs are actually in use and actual conflicts don't happen
unless the devices are in use (open).   The situation for I/O address
(such as 0x3f8) conflict is similar.
<P>This error is sometimes due to having two serial drivers: one a module
and the other compiled into the kernel.  Both drivers try to grab the
same resources and one driver finds them "busy".
<P>There are two possible cases when you see this message:
<OL>
<LI> There may be a real resource conflict that is being avoided.</LI>
<LI> Setserial has it wrong and the only reason <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> can't be
used is that setserial erroneously predicts a conflict.</LI>
</OL>
<P>What you need to do is to find the interrupt setserial thinks
<CODE>ttyS2</CODE> is using.  Look at /proc/tty/driver/serial (if you have
it).  You should also be able to find it with the "setserial" command
for <CODE>ttyS2</CODE>.   But due to a bug (reported by me in Nov. 2000) you
get the same "... busy" error message when you try this with
"setserial". 
<P>To try to resolve this problem reboot or: exit or gracefully kill all
likely conflicting processes.   If you reboot: 1. Watch the boot-time
messages for the serial ports.  2. Hope that the file that runs
"setserial" at boot-time doesn't (by itself) create the same conflict
again.
<P>If you think you know what IRQ say <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> is using then you may
look at /proc/interrupts to find what else (besides another serial
port) is currently using this IRQ.  You might also want to double
check that any suspicious IRQs shown here (and by "setserial") are
correct (the same as set in the hardware).  A way to test whether or
not it's a potential interrupt conflict is to set the IRQ to 0
(polling) using "setserial".  Then if the busy message goes away, it
was likely a potential interrupt conflcit.  It's not a good idea to
leave it permanently set at 0 since it will make the CPU work too
hard.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.19">17.19 "Input/output error" from setserial or stty</A>
</H2>

<P> You may have typed "ttys" instead of "ttyS".  You will see this
error message if you try to use the setserial command for any device
that is not a serial port.  It also may mean that the serial port is
in use (busy or opened) and thus the attempt to get/set parameters by
setserial or stty failed.  It could also mean that there isn't any
serial port at the IO address that setserial thinks your port is at.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.20">17.20 Overrun errors on serial port</A>

<H2><A NAME="ss17.21">17.21 Modem doesn't pick up incoming calls</A>
</H2>

<P> This paragraph is for the case where a modem is used for both
dial-in and dial-out.  If the modem generates a DCD (=CD) signal, some
programs (but not mgetty) will think that the modem is busy.
This will cause a problem when you are trying to dial out with a modem
and the modem's DCD or DTR are not implemented correctly.  The modem
should assert DCD only when there is an actual connection (ie someone
has dialed in), not when <CODE>getty</CODE> is watching the port.  Check to
make sure that your modem is configured to only assert DCD when there
is a connection (&amp;C1).  DTR should be on (asserted) by the
communications program whenever something is using, or watching the
line, like <CODE>getty</CODE>, <CODE>kermit</CODE>, or some other comm program.

<H2><A NAME="ss17.22">17.22 Port get characters only sporadically</A>
</H2>

<P> There could be some other program running on the port.  Use "top"
(provided you've set it to display the port number) or "ps -alxw".
Look at the results to see if the port is being used by another
program.  Be on the lookout for the gpm mouse program which often runs
on a serial port.

<H2><A NAME="ss17.23">17.23 Troubleshooting Tools</A>
</H2>

<P> These are some of the programs you might want to use in
troubleshooting: 
<UL>
<LI> "lsof /dev/ttyS*" will list serial ports which are open.</LI>
<LI> "setserial" shows and sets the low-level hardware configuration
of a port (what the driver thinks it is).  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#set_serial">What is Setserial</A> </LI>
<LI> "stty" shows and sets the configuration of a port (except for
that handled by "setserial").
See the Serial-HOWTO section: "Stty". </LI>
<LI> "modemstat" or "statserial" will show the current state of
various modem signal lines (such as DTR, CTS, etc.)</LI>
<LI> "irqtune" will give serial port interrupts higher
priority to improve performance.</LI>
<LI> "hdparm" for hard-disk tuning may help some more.</LI>
<LI> "lspci" shows the actual IRQs, etc. of hardware on the PCI bus.</LI>
<LI> "pnpdump --dumpregs" shows the actual IRQs, etc. of hardware for
PnP devices on the ISA bus.</LI>
<LI> Some "files" in the /proc tree (such as ioports, interrupts,
and tty/driver/serial).</LI>
</UL>
