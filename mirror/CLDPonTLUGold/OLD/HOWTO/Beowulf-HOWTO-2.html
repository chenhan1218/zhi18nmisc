<P>
<P>As the performance of commodity computer and network hardware
increase, and their prices decrease, it becomes more and more
practical to build parallel computational systems from off-the-shelf
components, rather than buying CPU time on very expensive
Supercomputers.  In fact, the price per performance ratio of a Beowulf
type machine is between three to ten times better than that for
traditional supercomputers.  Beowulf architecture scales well, it is
easy to construct and you only pay for the hardware as most of the
software is free.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Who should read this HOWTO ?</A>
</H2>

<P>This HOWTO is designed for a person with at least some exposure to the
Linux operating system.  Knowledge of Beowulf technology or
understanding of more complex operating system and networking
concepts is not essential, but some exposure to parallel computing
would be advantageous (after all you must have some reason to read
this document).  This HOWTO will not answer all possible questions you
might have about Beowulf, but hopefully will give you ideas and guide
you in the right direction.  The purpose of this HOWTO is to provide
background information, links and references to more advanced
documents.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 What is a Beowulf ?</A>
</H2>

<P><I>Famed was this Beowulf: far flew the boast of him, son of Scyld,
in the Scandian lands.  So becomes it a youth to quit him well with
his father's friends, by fee and gift, that to aid him, aged, in after
days, come warriors willing, should war draw nigh, liegemen loyal: by
lauded deeds shall an earl have honor in every clan.</I> Beowulf is
the earliest surviving epic poem written in English.  It is a story
about a hero of great strength and courage who defeted a monster
called Grendel.  See 
<A HREF="Beowulf-HOWTO-5.html#history">History</A> to find out
more about the Beowulf hero.
<P>There are probably as many Beowulf definitions as there are people who
build or use Beowulf Supercomputer facilities.  Some claim that one
can call their system Beowulf only if it is built in the same way as
the NASA's original machine.  Others go to the other extreme and call
Beowulf any system of workstations running parallel code.  My
definition of Beowulf fits somewhere between the two views described
above, and is based on many postings to the Beowulf mailing list:
<P>
<P>Beowulf is a multi computer architecture which can be used for
parallel computations.  It is a system which usually consists of one
server node, and one or more client nodes connected together via
Ethernet or some other network.  It is a system built using commodity
hardware components, like any PC capable of running Linux, standard
Ethernet adapters, and switches.  It does not contain any custom
hardware components and is trivially reproducible.  Beowulf also uses
commodity software like the Linux operating system, Parallel Virtual
Machine (PVM) and Message Passing Interface (MPI).  The server node
controls the whole cluster and serves files to the client nodes.  It
is also the cluster's console and gateway to the outside world.  Large
Beowulf machines might have more than one server node, and possibly
other nodes dedicated to particular tasks, for example consoles or
monitoring stations.  In most cases client nodes in a Beowulf system
are dumb, the dumber the better.  Nodes are configured and controlled
by the server node, and do only what they are told to do.  In a
disk-less client configuration, client nodes don't even know their IP
address or name until the server tells them what it is.  One of the
main differences between Beowulf and a Cluster of Workstations (COW)
is the fact that Beowulf behaves more like a single machine rather
than many workstations.  In most cases client nodes do not have
keyboards or monitors, and are accessed only via remote login or
possibly serial terminal.  Beowulf nodes can be thought of as a CPU +
memory package which can be plugged in to the cluster, just like a CPU
or memory module can be plugged into a motherboard.
<P>
<P> Beowulf is not a special software package, new network topology or
the latest kernel hack.  Beowulf is a technology of clustering Linux
computers to form a parallel, virtual supercomputer.  Although there
are many software packages such as kernel modifications, PVM and MPI
libraries, and configuration tools which make the Beowulf architecture
faster, easier to configure, and much more usable, one can build a
Beowulf class machine using standard Linux distribution without any
additional software.  If you have two networked Linux computers which
share at least the <CODE>/home</CODE> file system via NFS, and trust each
other to execute remote shells (rsh), then it could be argued that you
have a simple, two node Beowulf machine.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Classification</A>
</H2>

<P>Beowulf systems have been constructed from a variety of parts.  For the sake 
of performance some non-commodity components (i.e. produced by a single 
manufacturer) have been employed.   In order to account for the different 
types of systems and to make discussions about machines a bit easier, we 
propose the following simple classification scheme:
<P>CLASS I BEOWULF:
<P>This class of machines built entirely from commodity "off-the-shelf" parts.  
We shall use the "Computer Shopper" certification test to define commodity 
"off-the-shelf" parts.  (Computer Shopper is a 1 inch thick monthly 
magazine/catalog of PC systems and components.) The test is as follows:
<P>A CLASS I Beowulf is a machine that can be assembled
from parts found in at least 3 nationally/globally circulated
advertising catalogs.  
<P>The advantages of a CLASS I system are:
<UL>
<LI> hardware is available form multiple sources (low prices, easy maintenance)</LI>
<LI> no reliance on a single hardware vendor</LI>
<LI> driver support from Linux commodity</LI>
<LI> usually based on standards (SCSI, Ethernet, etc.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The disadvantages of a CLASS I system are:
<UL>
<LI>best performance may require CLASS II hardware</LI>
</UL>
<P>CLASS II BEOWULF
<P>A CLASS II Beowulf is simply any machine that does not pass the Computer 
Shopper certification test.  This is not a bad thing.  Indeed, it is merely a 
classification of the machine.
<P>The advantages of a CLASS II system are:
<UL>
<LI> Performance can be quite good!</LI>
</UL>
<P>The disadvantages of a CLASS II system are:
<UL>
<LI> driver support may vary</LI>
<LI> reliance on single hardware vendor</LI>
<LI> may be more expensive than CLASS I systems.</LI>
</UL>
<P>One CLASS is not necessarily better than the other.  It all depends on your 
needs and budget.  This classification system is only intended to make 
discussions about Beowulf systems a bit more succinct.  The "System Design" 
section may help determine what kind of system is best suited for your needs.
