<!--
backspace key!problems with

<P>Getting Delete and Backspace to work just right is nontrivial,
especially in a mixed environment, where you talk to console,
to <CODE>X</CODE>, to <CODE>bash</CODE>, to <CODE>emacs</CODE>, login remotely, etc.
You may have to edit several configuration files to tell all
of the programs involved precisely what you want.
On the one hand, there is the matter of which keys generate
which codes (and how these codes are remapped by e.g. <CODE>kermit</CODE>
or <CODE>emacs</CODE>), and on the other hand the question of what functions
are bound to what codes.
<P>People often complain `my backspace key does not work', as if this
key had a built-in function `delete previous character'.
Unfortunately, all this key, or any key, does is producing a code,
and one only can hope that the kernel tty driver and
all application programs can be configured such that
the backspace key indeed does function as a `delete previous character'
key.
<P>Most Unix programs get their tty input via the kernel tty driver
in `cooked' mode, and a simple <CODE>stty</CODE> command determines the
erase character. However, programs like <CODE>bash</CODE> and <CODE>emacs</CODE>
and <CODE>X</CODE> do their own input handling, and have to be convinced
one-by-one to do the right thing.

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If the character is erased, but in a funny way, then something is
wrong with your tty settings. If <CODE>echoprt</CODE> is set, then erased characters
are enclosed between <CODE>\</CODE> and <CODE>/</CODE>.
If <CODE>echoe</CODE> is not set, then the erase char is echoed
(which is reasonable when it is a printing character, like #).
Most people will want <CODE>stty echoe -echoprt</CODE>. Saying <CODE>stty sane</CODE>
will do this and more. Saying <CODE>stty -a</CODE> shows your current settings.
How come this is not right by default? It is, if you use the right
<CODE>getty</CODE>.
<P>Note that many programs (like <CODE>bash</CODE>, <CODE>emacs</CODE> etc.) have their own
keybindings (defined in <CODE>~/.inputrc</CODE>, <CODE>~/.emacs</CODE> etc.) and
are unaffected by the setting of the erase character.
<P>The standard Unix tty driver does not recognize a cursor, or keys
(like the arrow keys) to move the current position, and hence does not
have a command `delete current character' either. But for example
you can get <CODE>bash</CODE> on the console to recognize the Delete key by putting
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        set editing-mode emacs
        "\e[3~":delete-char

<P>Earlier, the console driver would do BS Space BS
(<CODE>\010\040\010</CODE>)
when it got a DEL (<CODE>\177</CODE>).
Nowadays, DEL's are ignored (as they should be,
since the driver emulates a vt100). Get a better getty, i.e.,
one that does not output DEL.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that (since XFree86-2.1) X reads the Linux settings of the keymaps
when initialising the X keymap. Although the two systems are not
100% compatible, this should mean that in many cases the use of
<CODE>xmodmap</CODE> has become superfluous.
<P>For example, suppose that you would like the Backspace key
to send a BackSpace (^H, octal 010) and the grey Delete key
a DEL (octal 0177). Add the following to <CODE>/etc/rc.local</CODE>
(or wherever you keep your local boot-time stuff):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        /usr/bin/loadkeys &lt;&lt; EOF
        keycode 14 = BackSpace
        keycode 111 = Delete
        EOF
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that this will only change the function of these keys
when no modifiers are used. (You need to specify a keymaps line
to tell which keymaps should be affected if you want to change
bindings on more keymaps.)
The Linux kernel default lets
Ctrl-Backspace generate BackSpace - this is sometimes useful
as emergency escape, when you find you can only generate DELs.
<P>The left Alt key is sometimes called the Meta key, and by
default the combinations AltL-X are bound to the symbol MetaX.
But what character sequence is MetaX?
That is determined (per-tty) by the Meta flag, set by the command
<CODE>setmetamode</CODE>. The two choices are: ESC X or X or-ed with 0200.

Of course you can bind other commands to other keys in the same way.
Note that various major and minor modes redefine keybindings.
For example, in incremental search mode one finds the code
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        (define-key map "\177" 'isearch-delete-char)
        (define-key map "\C-h" 'isearch-mode-help)

This means that it may be a bad idea to use the above two
global-set-key commands. There are too many places where
there are built-in assumptions about ^H = help and DEL = delete.
That doesn't mean that you have to setup keys so that Backspace
generates DEL. But if it doesn't then it is easiest to remap
them at the lowest possible level in emacs.

Recent versions of emacs have a function <CODE>keyboard-translate</CODE>

Note that under X emacs can distinguish between Ctrl-h and the
Backspace key (regardless of what codes these produce on the console),
and by default emacs will view the Backspace key as DEL
(and do deletion things, as bound to that character, rather than
help things, bound to ^H). One can distinguish Backspace and Delete,
e.g. by
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

        (global-unset-key [backspace] )
        (global-set-key [backspace] 'delete-backward-char)

<P>The netscape FAQ, however, says:
<PRE>
        Why doesn't my Backspace key work in text fields? 
        By default, Linux and XFree86 come with the Backspace and Delete keys
        misconfigured. All Motif programs (including, of course, Netscape
        Navigator) will malfunction in the same way.

        The Motif spec says that Backspace is supposed to delete the previous
        character and Delete is supposed to delete the following character.
        Linux and XFree86 come configured with both the Backspace and Delete
        keys generating Delete.

        You can fix this by using any one of the xmodmap, xkeycaps, or
        loadkeys programs to make the key in question generate the BackSpace
        keysym instead of Delete.

        You can also fix it by having a .motifbind file; see the man page
        for VirtualBindings(3).

        Note: Don't use the *XmText.translations or *XmTextField.translations
        resources to attempt to fix this problem. If you do, you will blow
        away Netscape Navigator's other text-field key bindings.

Add the following lines to your .xinitrc file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
xmodmap &lt;&lt;-EOF

keycode 107 =  Delete

<P>This will definitely work for a PC 101 or 102 key keyboard
with any Linux/XFree86 layout.
<P>The important part to making Motif apps like Netscape work properly
is adding osfBackSpace to keycode 22 in addition to BackSpace.

<P>
<!--

<!--

<P>When people have problems with backspace, they tend to look at their termcap
(or terminfo) entry for the terminal, and indeed, there does exist a kb
(or kbs) capability describing the code generated by the Backspace key.
However, not many programs use it, so unless you are having problems with one
particular program only, probably the fault is elsewhere.
Of course it is a good idea anyway to correct your termcap (terminfo) entry.
