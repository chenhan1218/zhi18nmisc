</H2>

<P> 
Although most PCI modems are "winmodems" without a
Linux driver (and will not work under Linux), other PCI serial cards
(usually modem cards) will often work OK under Linux.  Some need no
special support in the serial driver and work fine under Linux once
setserial is used to configure them.  Other PCI cards need special
support in the kernel.  Some of these cards are supported by kernel
2.4 (and in later versions of the 2.3 series).  Kernel 2.2 has no such
support.  If your modem (or serial port) happens to be supported, then
you shouldn't need to do anything to PnP configure it.  The new serial
driver will read the id number digitally stored on the card to
determine how to support the card.  It should assign the I/O address
to it, determine it's IRQ, etc.  So you don't need to use "setserial"
for it.  
<P>If you have a
PCI internal modem which you are convinced is not a winmodem 
but it will not work because the latest serial driver doesn't support
it, you can help in attempting to create a driver for it.  To do this
you'll need to contact the maintainer of the serial driver, Theodore
(Ted) Y.  Ts'o.  
But first check out the modem list site 
<A HREF="http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html">http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html</A> for the latest info
on PCI modems and related topic.  You will need to email Ted Ts'o a
copy of the output of "lspci -vv" with full information about the
model and manufacturer of the PCI modem (or serial port).  Then he
will try to point you to a test driver which might work for it.  You
will then need to get it, compile it and possibly recompile your
kernel.  Then you will test the driver to see if it works OK for you
and report the results to Ted Ts'o.  If you are willing to do all the
above (and this is the latest version of this HOWTO) then email the
needed info to him at: 
<A HREF="mailto:tytso@mit.edu">mailto:tytso@mit.edu</A>.
<P>PCI modems are not well standardized.  Some use main memory for
communication with the PC.  It you see 8-digit hexadecimal addresses
it's not likely to work with Linux.  Some require special enabling of
the IRQ.  The output of "lspci" can help determine if one can be
supported.  If you see a 4-digit IO port and no long memory address,
the modem might work by just telling "setserial" the IO port and the
IRQ.  Some people have gotten a 3COM 3CP5610 PCI Modem to work that
way.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="irq_io_conf"></A> <A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Configuring Overview </A>
</H2>

<P> In many cases, configuring will happen automatically and you have
nothing to do.  But sometimes you need to configure (or just want to
check out the configuration).  If so, first you need to know about the
two parts to configuring the serial port under Linux:
<P>The first part (low-level configuring) is assigning it an IO address,
IRQ, and name (such as ttyS2).  This IO-IRQ pair must be set in both
the hardware and told to the serial driver.  We might just call this
"io-irq" configuring for short.  The <CODE>setserial</CODE> is used to tell
the driver.  PnP methods, jumpers, etc, are used to set the hardware.
Details will be supplied later.  If you need to configure but don't
understand certain details it's easy to get into trouble.
<P>The second part (high-level configuring) is assigning it a speed (such
as 38.4k bits/sec), selecting flow control, etc.  This is often done
by communication programs such as PPP, minicom, or by getty (which you
may run on the port so that others may log into your computer).
However you will need to tell these programs what speed you want, etc.
by using a menu or a configuration file.  This high-level configuring
may also be done with the <CODE>stty</CODE> program.  <CODE>stty</CODE> is also useful
to view the current status if you're having problems.
See also the Serial-HOWTO section: "Stty".
When Linux starts, some effort is made to detect and configure
(low-level) a few serial ports.  Exactly what happens depends on your
BIOS, hardware, Linux distribution, etc.  If the serial ports work OK,
there may be no need for you to do any configuring.  Application
programs often do the high-level configuring but you may need to
supply them with the required information.  With Plug-and-Play serial
ports (often built into an internal modem), the situation has become
more complex.  Here are cases when you need to do low-level
configuring (set IRQ and IO addresses):
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Plan to use more than 2 serial ports</LI>
<LI> Installing a new serial port (such as an internal modem)</LI>
<LI>  Having problems with serial port(s)</LI>
</UL>
<P>For kernel 2.2+ you may be able to use more that 2 serial ports
without low-level configuring by sharing interrupts.  This only works
if the serial hardware supports it and may be no easier than low-level
configuring.  See 
<A HREF="#int_share-2.2">Interrupt sharing and Kernels 2.2+</A><P>The low-level configuring (setting the IRQ and IO address) seems to
cause people more trouble (than high-level), although for many it's
fully automatic and there is no configuring to be done.  Thus most all
of this section is on that topic.  Until the serial driver knows the
correct IRQ and IO address the port will not work at all.  It may not
even be found by Linux.  Even if it can be found, it may work
extremely slow if the IRQ is wrong.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-17.html#slow_">Extremely Slow: Text appears on the screen slowly after long delays</A>.
<P>In the Wintel world, the IO address and IRQ are called "resources" and
we are thus configuring certain resources.  But there are many other
types of "resources" so the term has many other meanings.  In review,
the low-level configuring consists of putting two values (an IRQ
number and IO address) into two places: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI> the device driver (often by running "<CODE>setserial</CODE>" at 
boot-time)</LI>
<LI> memory registers of the serial port hardware itself </LI>
</OL>
<P>You may watch the start-up (= boot-time) messages.  They are usually
correct.  But if you're having problems, there's a good chance that
some of these messages don't show the true configuration of the
hardware (and they are not supposed to).  See 
<A HREF="#boot_mesgs">I/O Address &amp; IRQ: Boot-time messages</A>.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Common mistakes made re low-level configuring</A>
</H2>

<P> Here are some common mistakes people make:
<UL>
<LI>setserial command: They run it (without the "autoconfig" and
auto_irq options) and think it has checked out the hardware (it
hasn't).  </LI>
<LI>setserial messages:  They see them displayed on the screen at
boot-time (or by giving the setserial command) and erroneously think
that the result always shows how their hardware is actually
configured.</LI>
<LI>/proc/interrupts: When their serial device isn't in use they
don't see its interrupt there, and erroneously conclude that their
serial port can't be found (or doesn't have an interrupt set).</LI>
<LI>/proc/ioports and /proc/tty/driver/serial: People think this
shows the actual hardware configuration when it only shows about the
same info (possibly erroneous) as setserial.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="boot_mesgs"></A> <A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 I/O Address &amp; IRQ: Boot-time messages </A>
</H2>

<P> In many cases your ports will automatically get low-level
configured at boot-time (but not always correctly).  To see what is
happening, look at the start-up messages on the screen.  Don't neglect
to check the messages from the BIOS before Linux is loaded (no
examples shown here).  These BIOS messages may be frozen by pressing
the Pause key.  Use Shift-PageUp to scroll back to the messages after
they have flashed by.  Shift-PageDown will scroll in the opposite
direction.  The <CODE>dmesg</CODE> command may be used at any time to view
some of the messages but it often misses important ones.  Here's an
example of the start-up messages (as of mid 1999).  Note that ttyS00
is the same as /dev/ttyS0.  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
At first you see what was detected (but the irq is only a wild guess):

Serial driver version 4.27 with no serial options enabled
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
ttyS02 at 0x03e8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A

Later you see what was saved, but it's not necessarily correct either:

Loading the saved-state of the serial devices...
/dev/ttyS0 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
/dev/ttyS1 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
/dev/ttyS2 at 0x03e8 (irq = 5) is a 16550A
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that there is a slight disagreement: The first message shows
ttyS2 at irq=4 while the second shows it at irq=5.  Your may only have
the first message.  In most cases the last message is the correct one.
But if your having trouble it may be misleading.  Before reading the
explanation of all of this complexity in the rest of this section, you
might just try using your serial port and see if it works OK.  If so
it may not be essential to read further.
<P>The second message is from the <CODE>setserial</CODE> program being run at
boot-time.  It shows what the device driver thinks is the correct
configuration.  But this too could be wrong.  For example, the irq
could actually be set to irq=8 in the hardware (both messages wrong).
The irq=5 could be there because someone incorrectly put this into a
configuration file (or the like).  The fact that Linux sometimes gets
IRQs wrong is because it doesn't by default probe for IRQs.  It just
assumes the "standard" ones (first message) or accepts what you told
it when you configured it (second message).  Neither of these is
necessarily correct.  If the serial driver has the wrong IRQ the
serial port is very slow or doesn't seem to work at all.
<P>The first message is a result of Linux probing the serial ports but it
doesn't probe for IRQs.  If a port shows up here it exists but the
IRQ may be wrong.  Linux doesn't check IRQs because doing so is not
foolproof.  It just assumes the IRQs are as shown because they are the
"standard" values.  Your may check them manually with <CODE>setserial</CODE>
using the <CODE>autoconfig</CODE> and <CODE>auto_irq</CODE> options but this isn't
guaranteed to be correct either.
<P>The data shown by the BIOS messages (which you see at first) is what
is set in the hardware.  If your serial port is Plug-and-Play PnP then
it's possible that the <CODE>isapnp</CODE> will run and change these settings.
Look for messages about this after Linux starts.  The last serial port
message shown in the example above should agree with the BIOS messages
(as possibly modified by isapnp).  If they don't agree then you either
need to change the setting in the port hardware or use setserial to
tell the driver what is actually set in the hardware.
<P>Also, if you have Plug-and-Play (PnP) serial ports, Linux will not
find them unless the IRQ and IO has been set inside the hardware by
Plug-and-Play software.  Prior to kernel 2.4 this was a common reason
why the start-up messages did not show a serial port that physically
exists.  The PC hardware (a PnP BIOS) may automatically low-level
configure this.  PnP configuring will be explained later.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="what_is_io_irq"></A> <A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 What is the current IO address and IRQ of my Serial Port ? </A>
</H2>

<P> If your serial port seems to work OK, then you may type "setserial
-g /dev/ttyS*", look at /proc/tty/driver/serial, or inspect the
start-up messages.  If you serial port doesn't work (or is very slow)
then you need to read further.
<P>There are really two answers to the question "What is my IO and
IRQ?" 1. What the device driver thinks has been set (This is what
setserial usually sets and shows).  2. What is actually set in the
hardware.  They both should be the same.  If they're not it spells
trouble since the driver has incorrect info on the physical serial
port.  If the driver has the wrong IO address it will try to send data
to a non-existing serial port --or even worse, to some other device.
If it has the wrong IRQ the driver will not get interrupt service
requests from the serial port, resulting in a very slow or no
response.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-17.html#slow_">Extremely Slow: Text appears on the screen slowly after long delays</A>.  If it has the wrong model of
UART there is also apt to be trouble.  To determine if both I0-IRQ
pairs are identical you must find out how they are set in both the
driver and the hardware.
<P>
<H3>What does the device driver think?</H3>

<P> This is easy to find out.  Just look at the start-up messages or
type "setserial -g /dev/ttyS*".   If everything works OK then what
it tells you is likely also set in the hardware.  There are some other
ways to find this info by looking at "files" in the /proc directory.
Be warned that there is no guarantee that the same is set in the
hardware.
<P><CODE>/proc/ioports</CODE> will show the IO addresses that the drivers are using.
<CODE>/proc/interrupts</CODE> shows the IRQs that are used by drivers of 
currently running processes (that have devices open).  It shows how
many interrupts have actually be issued.
<CODE>/proc/tty/driver/serial</CODE> shows most of the above, plus the
number of bytes that have been received and sent (even if the device
is not now open).
<P>Note that for the IO addresses and IRQ assignments, you are only seeing
what the driver thinks and not necessarily what is actually set in the
hardware.  The data on the actual number of interrupts issued and
bytes processed is real however.  If you see a large number of
interrupts and/or bytes then it probably means that the device is (or
was in the case of bytes) working.  If there are no bytes received
(rx:0) but bytes were transmitted (tx:3749 for example), then only one
direction of flow is working (or being utilized).
<P>Sometimes a showing of just a few interrupts doesn't mean that the
interrupt is actually being physically generated by any serial port.
Thus if you see almost no interrupts for a port that you're trying to
use, that interrupt might not be set in the hardware and it implies
that the driver is using the wrong interrupt.  To view
/proc/interrupts to check on a program that you're currently running
(such as "minicom") you need to keep the program running while you
view it.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="io-irq_in_hdw"></A> What is set in my serial port hardware ? </H3>

<P> How do you find out what IO address and IRQ are actually set in
the device hardware?  Perhaps the BIOS messages will tell you
some info before Linux starts booting.  Use the shift-PageUp key to
step back thru the boot-time messages and look at the very first ones
which are from the BIOS.  This is how it was before Linux started.
Setserial can't change it but isapnp or pciutils can and starting with
kernel 2.4, these will be built into the serial driver.  
<P>One crude method is try probing with setserial using the "autoconfig"
option.  You'll need to guess the addresses to probe at.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#set_serial">What is Setserial</A>.  For a PCI serial port, use
the "lspci" command (for kernels &lt;2.2 look at /proc/pci).  If your
serial port is is Plug-and-Play see the next two subsections.
<P>For a port set with jumpers, its how the jumpers were set.  If the
port is not Plug-and-Play (PnP) but has been setup by using a DOS
program then it's set at whatever the person who ran that program set
it to.
<P>
<H3>What is set in my PnP serial port hardware ? </H3>

<P> PnP ports don't store their configuration in the hardware when the
power is turned off.  This is in contrast to Jumpers (non-PnP) which
remain the same with the power off.  If you have an ISA PnP port, it
can reach a state where it doesn't have any IO address or IRQ and is
in effect disabled.  It should still be possible to find the port
using the <CODE>pnpdump</CODE> program.
<P>For Plug-and-Play (PnP) on the ISA bus one may try the <CODE>pnpdump</CODE>
program (part of <CODE>isapnptools</CODE>).  If you use the --dumpregs option
then it should tell you the actual IO address and IRQ set in the port.
The address it "trys" is not the device's IO address, but a special
<P>For PnP ports checking on how it's configured under DOS/Windows may not
be of much help.  Windows stores its configuration info in its
Registry which is not used by Linux.  It may supply the BIOS's
non-volatile memory with some info but it may not be kept in sync with
the current Window configuration in the Registry ??  If you let a PnP
BIOS automatically do the configuring when you start Linux (and have
told the BIOS that you don't have a PnP operating system when running
Linux) then Linux should use whatever configuration is in the BIOS's
non-volatile memory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="choose_IRQ"></A> <A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 Choosing Serial IRQs </A>
</H2>

<P> If you have Plug-and-Play ports then either a PnP BIOS or the
serial driver may configure all your devices for you and then you may
not need to choose any IRQs.  PnP determines what it thinks is best
and assigns them.  But if you use the tools in Linux for Plug-and-Play
(isapnp and pcitools) or jumpers then you have to choose.  If you
already know what IRQ you want to use you could skip this section
except that you may want to know that IRQ 0 has a special use (see the
following paragraph).
<P>
<H3>IRQ 0 is not an IRQ</H3>

<P> While IRQ 0 is actually the timer (in hardware) it has a special
meaning for setting a serial port with setserial.  It tells the driver
that there is no interrupt for the port and the driver then will use
polling methods.  This is quite inefficient but can be tried if there
is an interrupt conflict or mis-set interrupt.  The advantage of
assigning this is that you don't need to know what interrupt is set in
the hardware.  It should be used only as a temporary expedient until
you are able to find a real interrupt to use.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="int_share-2.2"></A> Interrupt sharing and Kernels 2.2+ </H3>

<P> The general rule is that every device should use a unique IRQ and
not share them.  But there are situations where sharing is permitted
such as with most multi-port boards.  Even when it is permitted, it
may not be as efficient since every time a shared interrupt is given a
check must be made to determine where it came from.  Thus if it's
feasible, it's nice to allocate every device its own interrupt.
<P>Prior to kernel 2.2, serial IRQs could be shared with each other only
for most multiport boards.  Starting with kernel 2.2 serial IRQs may
be sometimes shared between all serial ports.  In order for sharing to
work in 2.2 the kernel must have been compiled with
CONFIG_SERIAL_SHARE_IRQ, and the serial port hardware must support
sharing (so that if two serial cards put different voltages on the
same interrupt wire, only the voltage that means "this is an
interrupt" will prevail).  Thus even if you have 2.2, it may be best
to avoid sharing.
<P>
<H3>What IRQs to choose?</H3>

<P> The serial hardware often has only a limited number of IRQs it can
be set at.  Also you don't want IRQ conflicts.  So there may not be
much of a choice.  Your PC may normally come with <CODE>ttyS0</CODE> and
<CODE>ttyS2</CODE> at IRQ 4, and <CODE>ttyS1</CODE> and <CODE>ttyS3</CODE> at IRQ 3.  Looking
at <CODE>/proc/interrupts</CODE> will show which IRQs are being used by
programs currently running.  You likely don't want to use one of
these.  Before IRQ 5 was used for sound cards, it was often used for a
serial port.
<P>Here is how Greg (original author of Serial-HOWTO) set his up in
/etc/rc.d/rc.serial.  rc.serial is a file (shell script) which runs at
start-up (it may have a different name of location).  For versions of
"setserial" after 2.15 it's not always done this way anymore but this
example does show the choice of IRQs.

<P>There is really no Right Thing to do when choosing interrupts.  Just
make sure it isn't being used by the motherboard, or any other boards.
2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12 or 15 are possible choices.  Note that IRQ 2
is the same as IRQ 9.  You can call it either 2 or 9, the serial
driver is very understanding.  If you have a very old serial board it
may not be able to use IRQs 8 and above. 
<P>Make sure you don't use IRQs 1, 6, 8, 13 or 14!  These are used by
your motherboard.  You will make her very unhappy by taking her IRQs.
When you are done, double-check <CODE>/proc/interrupts</CODE> when
programs that use interrupts are being run and make sure there are no
conflicts.

<H2><A NAME="choose_address"></A> <A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 Choosing Addresses --Video card conflict with ttyS3</A>
</H2>

<P> The IO address of the IBM 8514 video board (and others like it) is
allegedly 0x?2e8 where ? is 2, 4, 8, or 9.  This may conflict with the
IO address of <CODE>ttyS3</CODE> at 0x02e8.  Your may think that this shouldn't
happen since the addresses are different in the high order digit (the
leading 0 in 02e8).  You're right, but a poorly designed serial port
may ignore the high order digit and respond to any address that ends
in 2e8.  That is bad news if you try to use <CODE>ttyS3</CODE> (ISA bus) at
this IO address.
<P>For the ISA bus you should try to use the default addresses shown
below.  Addresses shown represent the first address of an 8-byte
range.  For example 3f8 is really the range 3f8-3ff.  Each serial
device (as well as other types of devices that use IO addresses) needs
its own unique address range.  There should be no overlaps
(conflicts).  Here are the default addresses for commonly used serial
ports on the ISA bus:

<P>Suppose there is an address conflict (as reported by <CODE>setserial -g
/dev/ttyS*</CODE>) between a real serial port and another port which
does not physically exist (and shows UART: unknown).  Such a conflict
shouldn't cause problems but it sometimes does in older kernels.  To
avoid this problem don't permit such address conflicts or delete
/dev/ttySx if it doesn't physically exist.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="io-irq_methods"></A> <A NAME="ss6.8">6.8 Set IO Address &amp; IRQ in the hardware (mostly for PnP)</A>
 </H2>

<P> After it's set in the hardware don't forget to insure that it also
gets set in the driver by using <CODE>setserial</CODE>.  For non-PnP serial
ports they are either set in hardware by jumpers or by running a DOS
program ("jumperless") to set them (it may disable PnP).  The rest of
this subsection is only for PnP serial ports.  Here's a list of the
possible methods of configuring PnP serial ports:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Using a PnP BIOS CMOS setup menu
(usually only for external 
modems
on ttyS0 (Com1) and ttyS1 (Com2))</LI>
<LI> Letting a PnP BIOS automatically configure a PnP serial port
See 
<A HREF="#bios_conf">Using a PnP BIOS to I0-IRQ Configure</A></LI>
<LI> Doing nothing if you have both a PnP serial port and a PnP
Linux operating system (see Plug-and-Play-HOWTO).</LI>
<LI> Using <CODE>isapnp</CODE> for a PnP serial port non-PCI)</LI>
<LI> Using pciutils (pcitools) for the PCI bus</LI>
</UL>
<P>The IO address and IRQ must be set (by PnP) in their registers each
time the system is powered on since PnP hardware doesn't remember how
it was set when the power is shut off.  A simple way to do this is to
let a PnP BIOS know that you don't have a PnP OS and the BIOS will
automatically do this each time you start.  This might cause problems
in Windows (which is a PnP OS) if you start Windows with the BIOS
thinking that Windows is not a PnP OS.  See Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.
<P>Plug-and-Play was designed to automate this io-irq configuring,
but for Linux at present, it has made life more complicated.  The
standard kernels for Linux don't support plug-and-play very well.  If
you use a patch to the Linux kernel to covert it to a plug-and-play
operating system, then all of the above should be handled
automatically by the OS.  But when you want to use this to automate
configuring devices other that the serial port, you may find that
you'll still have to configure the drivers manually since many Linux
drivers are not written to support a Linux PnP OS.  If you use
<CODE>isapnptools</CODE> or the BIOS for configuring plug-and-play this will
only put the two values into the registers of the serial port section
of the modem card and you will likely still need to set up setserial.
None of this is easy or very well documented as of early 1999.  See
Plug-and-Play-HOWTO and the isapnptools FAQ.

<H3><A NAME="bios_conf"></A> Using a PnP BIOS to I0-IRQ Configure </H3>

<P> While the explanation of how to use a PnP OS or isapnp for io-irq
configuring should come with such software, this is not the case if
you want to let a PnP BIOS do such configuring.  Not all PnP BIOS can
do this.  The BIOS usually has a CMOS menu for setting up the first
two serial ports.  This menu may be hard to find and for an "Award"
BIOS it was found under "chipset features setup"  There is often
little to choose from.  Unless otherwise indicated in a menu, these
first two ports normally get set at the standard IO addresses and
IRQs.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-9.html#dev_nos">Serial Port Device Names &amp; Numbers</A><P>Whether you like it or not, when you start up a PC a PnP BIOS starts
to do PnP (io-irq) configuring of hardware devices.  It may do the job
partially and turn the rest over to a PnP OS (which you probably don't
have) or if thinks you don't have a PnP OS it may fully configure all
the PnP devices but not configure the device drivers.  This is what
you want but it's not always easy to figure out exactly what the PnP
BIOS has done.
<P>If you tell the BIOS that you don't have a PnP OS, then the PnP BIOS
should do the configuring of all PnP serial ports --not just the first
two.  An indirect way to control what the BIOS does (if you have
Windows 9x on the same PC) is to "force" a configuration under
Windows.  See Plug-and-Play-HOWTO and search for "forced".  It's
easier to use the CMOS BIOS menu which may override what you 
"forced" under Windows.  There could be a BIOS option that can set or
disable this "override" capability.
<P>If you add a new PnP device, the BIOS should change its PnP
configuration to accommodate it.  It could even change the io-irq of
existing devices if required to avoid any conflicts.  For this
purpose, it keeps a list of non-PnP devices provided that you have
told the BIOS how these non-PnP devices are io-irq configured.  One
way to tell the BIOS this is by running a program called ICU under
DOS/Windows.
<P>But how do you find out what the BIOS has done so that you set up the
device drivers with this info?  The BIOS itself may provide some info,
either in its setup menus of via messages on the screen when you turn
on your computer.  See 
<A HREF="#io-irq_in_hdw">What is set in my serial port hardware?</A><H2><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9 Giving the IRQ and IO Address to Setserial</A>
</H2>

<P> Once you've set the IRQ and IO address in the hardware (or arranged
for it to be done by PnP) you also need to insure that the "setserial"
command is run each time you start Linux.  See the subsection
