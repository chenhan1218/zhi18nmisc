<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1 Netwinders</A>
</H2>

<P>For the Netwinders (which uses the ARM SA110 RISC chip - a lovely British 
processor), there are two versions of the Cyber2000 framebuffer driver -
one for 2.0.x kernels and one for 2.2.x kernels. It is quite straightforward
to enable and use this driver on both kernels, however, the older version is
hardcoded for depth and resolution (blech), but the good news is that the newer
version in the 2.2.x kernels is much more flexible, but currently in a state
of flux as it is still in development. To get this up and running, your best 
bet is to read the documentation that comes with the ARM port of the kernel
sources. 
<P>The Netwinders uses a VGA compatible chipset, but unfortunately noone has 
ported vgafb to it yet. That might happen if someone has some time on their 
hands. [I would do it if someone would give me a NetWinder to play with] 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.2">13.2 Acorn Archimedes</A>
</H2>

<P>Acorns have always had framebuffer support since the Linux 1.9.x days. However 
the Acornfb driver in 2.2.x is totally new since the generic framebuffer 
interface changed during the development of 2.1.x kernels (which, of course, 
became 2.2.x). As previously, it is a simple matter to activate the driver and
set depths and resolutions.

</H2>

<P>Surprisingly, there is even a framebuffer driver for the Psion 5 and the Geofox!
I have been told that it displays the Penguin quite well. [Someone please donate
me a Psion 5!]
