<P>NNs are models of biological neural networks and some are not, but 
historically, much of the inspiration for the field of
NNs came from the desire to produce artificial systems capable 
of sophisticated, perhaps "intelligent", computations similar to
those that the human brain routinely performs, and thereby 
possibly to enhance our understanding of the human brain. 
<P>Most NNs have some sort of "training" rule whereby the weights
of connections are adjusted on the basis of data. In other
words, NNs "learn" from examples (as children learn to 
recognize dogs from examples of dogs) and exhibit some capability for
generalization beyond the training data. 
<P>NNs normally have great potential for parallelism, since the computations 
of the components are largely independent of each
other. Some people regard massive parallelism and high connectivity to 
be defining characteristics of NNs, but such
requirements rule out various simple models, such as simple 
linear regression (a minimal feedforward net with only two units
plus bias), which are usefully regarded as special cases of NNs.
<P>Some definitions of Neural Network (NN) are as follows:
<UL>
<LI> According to the DARPA Neural Network Study :
A neural network is a system composed of many simple processing 
elements operating in parallel whose function is
determined by network structure, connection strengths, and the 
processing performed at computing elements or nodes.</LI>
<LI> According to Haykin: A neural network is a massively parallel distributed processor that has a natural propensity for storing experiential
knowledge and making it available for use. It resembles the brain in two respects: 
<UL>
<LI>Knowledge is acquired by the network through a learning process. </LI>
<LI>Interneuron connection strengths known as synaptic weights are used to store the knowledge. </LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI> According to Nigrin: A neural network is a circuit composed of a 
very large number of simple processing elements that are neurally based.
Each element operates only on local information. Furthermore each 
element operates asynchronously; thus there is no
overall system clock. </LI>
<LI> According to Zurada: Artificial neural systems, or neural networks, are physical cellular systems which can acquire, store, and utilize
experiential knowledge.</LI>
