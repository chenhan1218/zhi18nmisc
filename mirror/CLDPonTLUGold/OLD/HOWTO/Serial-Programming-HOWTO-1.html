<P>This is the Linux Serial Programming HOWTO.  All about how to program
communications with other devices / computers over a serial line under
Linux. Different techniques are explained: Canonical I/O (only
complete lines are transmitted/received), asyncronous I/O, and waiting
for input from multiple sources.
<P>This document does not describe how to set up serial ports, because
this has been described by Greg Hankins in the Serial-HOWTO.
<P>I have to emphasize that I am not an expert in this field, but have
had problems with a project that involved such communication. The code
examples presented here were derived from the miniterm code available
from the LDP programmers guide
(<CODE>ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/LDP/programmers-guide/lpg-0.4.tar.gz</CODE>
and mirrors)
in the examples directory. 
<P>Since I wrote this document in June 1997, I have moved to WinNT to
satisfy customers need, so I have not built up more in depth
knowledge. If anybody has any comments, I will gladly incorporate them
into this document (see sect. Feedback). If someone would like to take
over and do a better job, please e-mail me.
<P>All examples were tested using a i386 Linux Kernel 2.0.29.
