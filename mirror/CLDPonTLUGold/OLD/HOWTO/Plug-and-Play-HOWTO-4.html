<H2><A NAME="conf_pnp_bios"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Setting up a PnP BIOS </A></H2>

<P> When the computer is first turned on, the BIOS runs before the
operating system is loaded.  Modern BIOSs are PnP and can configure
some or all of the PnP devices.  Here are some of the choices
which may exist in your BIOS's CMOS menu:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 
<A HREF="#bios_pnp_os">Do you have a PnP operating  system?</A></LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="#bios_resources">How are bus-resources to be controlled?</A></LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="#bios_reset">Reset the configuration?</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="bios_pnp_os"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Do you have a PnP operating system? </A>
</H2>

<P> In any case the PnP BIOS will PnP-configure the hard-drive, video
card, and keyboard to make the system bootable.  If you said you had a
PnP OS it will leave it up to the operating system (or device drivers)
to finish the configuration job.  If you said no PnP OS then the BIOS
should configure everything.  If you only run Linux on your PC, you
should probably tell it truthfully that you don't have a PnP operating
system If you also run MS Windows on your PC and said it was a PnP OS
when you installed Windows, then you might try saying that you have a
PnP OS to keep Windows 95/98 happy (but it might cause problems for
Linux.  For Windows 2000 it's claimed that Windows worked OK even if you
say you don't have a PnP OS.  In this case Windows 2000 will report
finding new hardware (even though it already knew about the hardware
but didn't know how the BIOS Pnp-configured it).
<P>If you say you have a PnP OS then you rely on the Linux device drivers
and possibly the program isapnp to take care of the bus-resource
configuring.  This often works OK but sometimes doesn't.  Fibbing to
Linux this way has sometimes actually fixed problems.  This could be
because the BIOS didn't do it's job right but Linux alone did.
<P>If you tell the BIOS you don't have a PnP OS, then the BIOS will do
the configuring itself.  Unless you have added new PnP devices, it
should use the configuration which it has stored in its non-volatile
memory (ESCD).  See 
<A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO-5.html#escd_">The BIOS's ESCD Database</A>.
If the last session on your computer was with Linux, then there should
be no change in configuration.  See 
<A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO-5.html#bios_conf">BIOS Configures PnP</A>.  But if the last session was with Windows9x (which
is PnP) then Windows could have modified the ESCD.  It supposedly does
this only if you "force" a configuration or install a legacy device.
See 
<A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO-5.html#W9x_ESCD">Using Windows to set ESCD</A>.  Device
drivers that do configuring may modify what the BIOS has done.  So
will the isapnp or PCI Utilities programs.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Interoperability with Windows</H3>

<P> If you are running both Linux and Windows on the same PC, how do
you answer the BIOS's question: Do you have a PnP OS?  Normally (and
truthfully) you would say no for Linux and yes for Windows.  If you're
truthful, everything should work OK.  But it's a lot of bother to have
to set up the BIOS's CMOS menu manually each time you want to switch
OSs.  To fix this you need to fib about either Linux or Windows.  If
you fib, everything may not work OK but probably can (with some effort)
be made to work OK.
<P>If you intend on fibbing, should you tell the truth about Windows or
Linux?   This depends on how good your Linux of Windows is about
configuring itself if you fib about it.  Both Windows 2000 and Linux
seem to be getting better about coping with such fibs.
<P>
<H3>Fibbing to LinuxIf you say that you have a PnP OS, then Linux may work OK if all thedrivers and isapnp (if you use it) are able to configure OK.  Perhapsupdating of the Linux OS and/or drivers will help.</H3>

<H3>Fibbing to Windows9x</H3>

<P>Another solution is to set the CMOS for no PnP OS, including when
you start Windows.  Now you are fibbing to Windows and since Windows
is seemingly much more sophisticated in handling PnP.  One would
expect Windows9x to be able to cope with with hardware that has been
fully configured by the BIOS but it can't.  But it's reported that
Windows 2000 can cope with this.  One might expect that even if
Windows9x didn't realize that the hardware was already configured, it
would set the configuration of the physical devices per it's registry
and then then everything would work OK.  
<P>But it doesn't seem to happen this way.  It seems that Windows9x may
just tell its device drivers what has been stored in the Windows'
Registry.  But the actual hardware configuration (done by the BIOS) is
what was stored in the ESCD and may not be the same as the Registry =>
trouble.  So for Windows to work OK you need to get the Registry to
contain the bus-resource configuration which the BIOS creates from the
ESCD.
<P>One way to try to get the Registry and the ESCD the same is to install
(or reinstall) Windows when the BIOS is set for "not a PnP OS".  This
should present Windows with hardware configured by the BIOS.  If this
configuration is without conflicts, Windows will hopefully leave it
alone and save it in it's Registry.  Then the ESCD and the registry
are in sync.  If this works for you (and this is the latest version of
this HOWTO), let me know as I only have one report of this working out
OK.  
<P>Another method is to remove devices that are causing problems in
Windows by clicking on "remove" in the Device Manager.  Then reboot with
"Not a PnP OS" (set it in the CMOS as you start to boot).  Windows
will then reinstall the devices, hopefully using the bus-resource
settings configured by the BIOS.  Be warned that Windows will likely
ask you to insert the Window installation CD since it sometimes can't
find the driver files (and the like) even though they are still
there.  A workaround for this is to select "skip file" and continue.
<P>As a test I "removed" a NIC card which used a Novell compatible
driver.  Upon rebooting, Windows reinstalled it with Microsoft
Networking instead of Novell.  This meant that the Novell Client
needed to be reinstalled --a lot of unnecessary work.
<P>
<H3>Fibbing to Windows 2000</H3>

<P>If you have Windows 2000, it's claimed that fibbing to it will work
out OK (if you said it was a PnP-OS when you first installed Windows
2000).  When you change to not a PnP-OS, Windows 2000 is reported to
automatically PnP-reconfigure it's devices and tell you that it's
finding new hardware and installing new devices.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="bios_resources"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 How are bus-resources to be controlled? </A>
 </H2>

<P> This may involve just deciding how to
allocate IRQ and DMA bus-resources.  If set to "auto", the BIOS will
do the allocation.  If set to manual, you manually reserve some IRQ's
for use on "legacy" (non-pnp) ISA cards.  The BIOS may or may not
otherwise know about such legacy cards.  The BIOS will only know about
these legacy cards if you ran ICU (or the like) under Windows to tell
the BIOS about them.  If the BIOS knows about them, then try using
"auto".  If it doesn't know about them, then manually reserve the
IRQ's needed for the legacy ISA cards and let the rest be for the BIOS
PnP to allocate.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="bios_reset"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Reset the configuration? </A>
</H2>

<P> This will erase the BIOSs ESCD data-base of how your PnP devices
should be configured as well as the list of how legacy (non-PnP)
devices are configured.  Never do this unless you are convinced that
this data-base is wrong and needs to be remade.  It was stated
somewhere that you should do this only if you can't get your computer
to boot.  If the BIOS loses the data on legacy devices, then you'll
need to run ICA again under DOS/Windows to reestablish this data.
