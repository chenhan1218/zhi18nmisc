<H2><A NAME="s6">6. FAQ: Voodoo Graphics (tm)? 3Dfx? </A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Who is 3Dfx?</A>
</H2>

<P>3Dfx is a San Jose based manufacturer of 3D graphics 
accelerator hardware for arcade games, game consoles,
and PC boards.
Their official website is
<A HREF="http://www.3dfx.com/">www.3dfx.com</A>. 3Dfx does not sell any boards,
but other companies do, e.g. Quantum3D.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Who is Quantum3D?</A>
</H2>

<P>Quantum3D started as a 3Dfx spin-off, manufacturing
high end accelerator boards based on 3Dfx chip
technology for consumer and business market, and
supplying arcade game technology. See
their home page at
<A HREF="http://www.quantum3d.com/">www.quantum3d.com</A>
for additional information. For general inquiries
regarding Quantum3D,
please send mail to
<A HREF="mailto:info@quantum3d">info@quantum3d</A>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 What is the Voodoo Graphics (tm)?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Voodoo Graphics (tm) is a chipset manufactured by 3Dfx. It
is used in hardware acceleration boards for the PC.
See the HOWTO section on supported hardware.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 What is the Voodoo Rush (tm)?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Voodoo Rush (tm) is a derivate of the Voodoo Graphics (tm) that
has an interface to cooperate with a 2D VGA
video accelerator, effectively supporting
accelerated graphics in windows. This combo 
is currently not supported with Linux.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 What is the Voodoo 2 (tm)?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Voodoo 2 (tm) is the successor of the Voodoo Graphics (tm) chipset,
featuring several improvements. It is announced
for late March 1998, and annoucements of Voodoo 2 (tm)
based boards have been published e.g. by Quantum 3D,
by Creative Labs, Orchid Technologies, and
Diamond Multimedia.
<P>The Voodoo 2 (tm) is supposed to be backwards compatible.
However, a new version of Glide will have to be
ported to Linux. 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 What is VGA pass-though?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Voodoo Graphics (tm) (but not the Voodoo Rush (tm)) boards are
add-on boards, meant to be used with a regular
2D VGA video accelerator board. In short, the
video output of your regular VGA board is used
as input for the Voodoo Graphics (tm) based add-on board,
which by default passes it through to the display
also connected to the Voodoo Graphics (tm) board. If the
Voodoo Graphics (tm) is used (e.g. by a game), it will
disconnect the VGA input signal, switch the
display to a 640x480 fullscreen mode with the
refresh rate configured by SST variables and
the application/driver, and generate the video
signal itself. The VGA doesn't need to be aware
of this, and won't be.
<P>This setup has several advantages: free choice
of 2D VGA board, which is an issue with Linux,
as XFree86 drivers aren't available for all
chipsets and revisions, and a cost effective 
migration path to accelerated 3D graphics. It 
also has several disadvantages: an application
using the Voodoo Graphics (tm) might not re-enable video
output when crashing, and regular VGA video
signal deteoriates in the the pass-through
process.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 What is Texelfx or TMU?</A>
</H2>

<P>Voodoo Graphics (tm) chipsets have two units. The first one interfaces
the texture memory on the board, does the texture mapping,
and ultimately generates the input for the second unit
that interfaces the framebuffer. This one is called
Texelfx, aka Texture Management Unit, aka TMU. The neat
thing about this is that a board can use two Texelfx
instead of only one, like some of
the Quantum3D Obsidian boards did, effectively doubling the
processing power in some cases, depending on the application.
<P>As each Texelfx can address 4MB texture memory, a dual
Texelfx setup has an effective texture cache of up to 8MB.
This can be true even if only one Texelfx is actually
needed by a particular application, as textures can be
distributed to both Texelfx, which are used depending
on the requested texture. Both Texelfx are used together
to perform certain operations as trilinear filtering and
illumination texture/lightmap passes (e.g. in glQuake)
in a single pass instead of the two passes that are
required with only one Texelfx. To actually exploit the
theoretically available speedup and cache size increase,
a Glide application has to use both Texelfx properly.
<P>The two Texelfx can not be used separately to
each draw a textured triangle at the same time. A triangle
is always drawn using whatever the current setup is,
which can be to use both Texelfx for a single pass
operation combining two textures, or one Texelfx
for only a single texture. Each Texelfx can only
access its own memory.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8 What is a Pixelfx unit?</A>
</H2>

<P>Voodoo Graphics (tm) chipsets have two units. The second one interfaces
the framebuffer and ultimately generates the depth buffer
and pixel color updates. This one is called Pixelfx. The
neat thing here is that two Pixelfx units can cooperate
in SLI mode, like with some of the Quantum3D Obsidian boards,
effectively doubling the frame rate.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9 What is SLI mode?</A>
</H2>

<P>SLI means "Scanline Interleave". In this mode, two Pixelfx
are connected and render in alternate turns, one handling
odd, the other handling even scanlines of the actual output.
Inthis mode, each Pixelfx stores only half of the image
and half of the depth buffer data in its own local
framebuffer, effectively doubling the number of pixels.
<P>The Pixelfx in question can be on the same board,
or on two boards properly connected. Some Quantum3D
Obsidian boards support SLI with Voodoo Graphics (tm).
<P>As two cards can decode the same PCI addresses and receive
the same data, there is not necessarily additional bus
bandwidth required by SLI. On the other hand, texture
data will have to be replicated on both boards, thus
the amount of texture memory effectively stays the same.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.10">6.10 Is there a single board SLI setup?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are now two types of Quantum3D SLI boards.
The intial setup used two boards, two PCI slots,
and an interconnect (e.g. the Obsidian 100-4440).
The later revision which performs identically is
contained on one full-length PCI board (e.g.
Obsidian 100-4440SB). Thus a single board SLI
solution is possible, and has been done.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.11">6.11 How much memory? How many buffers?</A>
</H2>

<P>The most essential difference between different boards
using the Voodoo Graphics (tm) chipset is the amount and
organization of memory. Quantum3D used a three digit
scheme to descibe boards. Here is a slightly modifed
one (anticipating Voodoo 2 (tm)). Note that if you use
more than one Texelfx, they need the same amount of
texture cache memory each, and if you combine two
Pixelfx, each needs the same amount of frame buffer
memory. 
<HR>
<PRE>
    "SLI / Pixelfx / Texelfx1 / Texelfx2 "
</PRE>
<HR>

It means that a common 2MB+2MB board would be a
<CODE>1/2/2/0</CODE> solution, with the minimally
required total 4Mb of memory. A Canopus Pure 3D
would be <CODE>1/2/4/0</CODE>, or 6MB. An Obsidian-2220
board with two Texelfx would be <CODE>1/2/2/2</CODE>,
and an Obsidian SLI-2440 board would be <CODE>2/2/4/4</CODE>.
A fully featured dual board solution (2 Pixelfx, each
with 2 Texelfx and 4MB frame buffer, each Texelfx 4 MB
texture cache) would be <CODE>2/4/4/4</CODE>, and the
total amount of memory would be
<CODE>SLI*(Pixelfx+Texelfx1+Texelfx2)</CODE>, or 24 MB.   
<P>So there. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.12">6.12 Does the Voodoo Graphics (tm) do 24 or 32 bit color?</A>
</H2>

<P>No. The Voodoo Graphics (tm) architecture uses 16bpp internally.
This is true for  Voodoo Graphics (tm), Voodoo Rush (tm) and Voodoo 2 (tm)
alike. Quantum3D claims to implement 22-bpp effective color depth
with an enhanced 16-bpp frame buffer, though. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.13">6.13 Does the Voodoo Graphics (tm) store 24 or 32 bit z-buffer per pixel?</A>
</H2>

<P>No. The Voodoo Graphics (tm) architecture uses 16bpp internally
for the depth buffer, too. This again is true for  Voodoo Graphics (tm),
Voodoo Rush (tm) and Voodoo 2 (tm) alike. Again, Quantum3D claims
that using the floating point 16-bits per pixel (bpp) depth
buffering provides 22-bpp effective Z-buffer precision.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.14">6.14 What resolutions does the Voodoo Graphics (tm) support?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Voodoo Graphics (tm) chipset supports up to 4 MB frame buffer
memory. Presuming double buffering and a depth buffer,
a 2MB framebuffer will support a resolution of 640x480.
With 4 MB frame buffer, 800x600 is possible.
<P>Unfortunately 960x720 is not supported. The Voodoo Graphics (tm)
chipset requires that the amount of memory for a particular
resolution must be such that the vertical and horizontal
resolutions must be evenly divisible by 32. The video
refresh controller, though can output any particular
resolution, but the "virtual" size required for the memory
footprint must be in dimensions evenly divisible by 32.
So, 960x720 actually requires 960x736 amount of memory,
and 960x736x2x3 = 4.04MBytes.
<P>However, using two boards with SLI, or a dual Pixelfx
SLI board means that each framebuffer will only have
to store half of the image. Thus 2 times 4 MB in SLI
mode are good up to 1024x768, which is the maximum
because of the overall hardware design. You will be
able to do 1024x768 tripled buffered with Z, but you
will not be able to do e.g. 1280x960 with double
buffering.
<P>Note that triple buffering (no VSync synchonization 
required by the application), stereo buffering (for
interfacing LCD shutters) and other more demanding
setups will severely decrease the available resolution.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.15">6.15 What texture sizes are supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>The maximum texture size for the Voodoo Graphics (tm) chipset 
is 256x256, and you have to use powers of two. Note
that for really small textures (e.g. 16x16) you
are better off merging them into a large texture,
and adjusting your effective texture coordinates
appropriately.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.16">6.16 Does the Voodoo Graphics (tm) support paletted textures?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Voodoo Graphics (tm) hardware and Glide support the palette
extension to OpenGL. The most recent version of
Mesa does support the 
<CODE>GL_EXT_paletted_texture</CODE>
and 
<CODE>GL_EXT_shared_texture_palette</CODE> extensions.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.17">6.17 What about overclocking?</A>
</H2>

<P>If you want to put aside considerations about warranty
and overheating, and want to do overclocking to boost
up performance even further, there is related info out
on the web. The basic mechanism is to use
Glide environment variables to adjust the clock.
<P>Note that the actual recommended clock is board
dependend. While the default clock speed is 50 Mhz,
the Diamond Monster 3D property sheet lets you set up
a clock of 57 MHz. It all comes down to the design of
a specific board, and which components are used with
the Voodoo Graphics (tm) chipset - most notably access speed of
the RAM in question. If you exceed the limits of your
hardware, rendering artifacts will occur to say the
least. Reportedly, 57 MHz usually works, while 60 MHz
or more is already pushing it.
<P>Increasing the clock frequency also means increasing
the waste heat disposed in the chips, in a nonlinear
dependency (10% increase in frequency means a lot
larger increase in heating). In consequence, for permanent
overclocking you might want to educate yourself about
ways to  add cooling fans to the board in a way that does
not affect warranty. A very recommendable source is
the "3Dfx Voodoo Heat Report" by Eric van Ballegoie,
available on the web.
