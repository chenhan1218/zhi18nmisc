<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Is the Serial Port Obsolete?</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P> The answer is yes, but ... The serial port is somewhat obsolete
but it's still needed, especially for Linux.  The serial port has many
shortcomings but almost all new PC's seem to come with them them.
Linux supports ordinary telephone modems only if they work thru a
serial port.
<P>The serial port must pass data between the computer and the external
cable.  Thus it has two interfaces and both of these interfaces are
slow.  First we'll consider the interface via external cable to the
outside world.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 EIA-232 Cable Is Low Speed &amp; Short Distance</A>
</H2>

<P> The conventional EIA-232 serial port is inherently low speed and
is severely limited in distance.  Ads often read "high speed" but it
can only work at "high speed" over very short distances such as to a
modem located right next to the computer.  Compared to a network card,
even this "high speed" is low speed.  All of the serial cable wires
use a common ground return wire so that twisted-pair technology
(needed for high speeds) can't be used without additional hardware.
More modern interfaces for serial ports exist but they are not
standard on PC's like the EIA-232 is.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-18.html#non_232">Successors to EIA-232</A>.  Some multiport serial cards support
them.
<P>It is somewhat tragic that the RS-232 standard from 1969 did not use
twisted pair technology which could operate about a hundred times
faster.  Twisted pairs have been used in telephone cables since the
late 1800's.  In 1888 (over 110 years ago) the "Cable Conference"
reported its support of twisted-pair (for telephone systems) and
pointed out its advantages.  But over 80 years after this approval by
the "Cable Conference", RS-232 failed to utilize it.   Since RS-232
was originally designed for connecting a terminal to a low speed modem
located nearby, the need for high speed and longer distance
transmission was apparently not recognized.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Inefficient Interface to the Computer</A>
</H2>

<P> To communicate with the computer, any I/O device needs to have
an address so that the computer can write to it and read from it.  For
this purpose many I/O devices (such as serial ports) use a special
type of address known as an I/O addresses (sometimes called an I/O
port).   It's actually a range of addresses and the lower address in
this range is the base address.  If someone only says (or writes)
"address" it likely really means "base address" 
<P>Instead of using I/O, addresses some I/O devices read and write
directly from/to main memory.  This provides more bandwidth since the
conventional serial I/O system only moves a byte at a time.  There are
various ways to read/write directly to main memory.  One way is called
shared memory I/O (where the shared memory is usually on the same card
as the I/O device).  Other methods are DMA (direct memory access) on
the ISA bus and  what is about the same as DMA (only much faster):
"bus mastering" on the PCI bus.  These methods are a lot faster than
those used for the serial port.  Thus the conventional serial port
with its interrupt driven (every 14 bytes) interface and single bytes
transfers on a bus which could accommodate 4 (or 8) bytes at a time is
not suited for very high speed I/O.
