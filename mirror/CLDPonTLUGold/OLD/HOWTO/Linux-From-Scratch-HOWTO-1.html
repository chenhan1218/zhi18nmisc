<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What's this all about?</A>
 </H2>

<P>Having used a number of different Linux distributions, I was never fully
satisfied with either of those. I didn't like the way the bootscripts were
arranged, or I didn't like the way certain programs were configured by default
and more of those things. I came to realize that when I want to be totally
satisfied with a Linux system, I have to build my own Linux system from scratch.
Ideally only using the source code. No pre-compiled packages of any kind. No
help from some sort of cdrom or bootdisk that would install some basic utilities.
You would use your current Linux system and use that one to build your own.
<P>This, at one time, wild idea seemed very difficult and at times almost
impossible. The reason for most problems were due to my lack of knowledge about
certain programs and procedures. After sorted out all kinds of dependency problems,
compilation problems, etcetera, a manually Linux system was created and fully
operational. I called this system and LFS system which stands for LinuxFromScratch.

<P>2.1.5 - March 26th, 2000
<P>This is not a full list of modified things. Because v2.0 is a major release,
only the major changes are mentioned and not the minor ones.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Directory structure modified - LFS is FHS compliant now. Perhaps not 100%,
but getting there.</LI>
<LI>New Glibc installation method</LI>
<LI>New GCC installation method</LI>
<LI>Eliminated the need for the pre-compiled Debian packages.</LI>
<LI>Totally revised software installation method - eliminated the need of all
the statically linked packages in former chapter 6.1. </LI>
<LI>Various bugs fixed in software installation</LI>
<LI>Installed a few more programs from the util-linux package</LI>
<LI>Added the installation of the Bzip2 program</LI>
<LI>Explained in greater detail what the $LFS is all about - how to
and how not to use it.</LI>
<LI>Simplified installation procedures for all packages in chapters 5 through
9.1</LI>
<LI>Moved the installation of Glibc and GCC to chapter 7 in stead of having
their own chapters which isn't necessary.</LI>
<LI>Modified Internet servers chapter: separated into Network Daemons and Network
Clients chapter. Internet chapter has merged with these two new chapters.</LI>
<LI>Switched chapters 13 and 14 (X and Internet) and merged the chapters about
X and Window Maker into chapter 14.</LI>
<LI>We're using a new Man program. This one is easier to use and configure
than the man-db one we previously used. Both versions perform nearly the same
jobs.</LI>
<LI>Added new chapter 13: Resources. This chapter contains a number of books
and HOWTOs you'll find useful to read during or after building an LFS system.</LI>
<LI>Chapter 3: Fixed bzip2 link</LI>
<LI>Chapter 7.2.42: Simplified Util-Linux installation method</LI>
<LI>Chapter 3.1: Changed procps location</LI>
<LI>Chapter 7.2: Switched installation of Vim and Util-Linux (as we need an
editor to install Util-Linux)</LI>
<LI>Chapter 7.3.33: Fixed procps installation.</LI>
<LI>Chapter 5.2: stripped inittab file so it won't complain about missing files
at boot time.</LI>
<LI>Chapter 6: Rewrote kernel installation</LI>
<LI>Chapter 10.3: Fixed Apache bootscript</LI>
<LI>Chapter 10.3.2: Removed section about modifying the httpd.conf file. No
longer necessary. Added the addition of /usr/apache/man to the /usr/share/misc/man.conf
file</LI>
<LI>Chapter 11.1: Provided a fixed mailx package with a working Makefile file
to simplify the installation procedure</LI>
<LI>Chapter 11.3.1: Added the --shared switch to configure so that Zlib is
installed as a dynamic library rather than a static one.</LI>
<LI>Chapter 11.6: Have Lynx link against the Ncurses library in stead of the
Slang.</LI>
<LI>Chapter 12: The newer man-db already has the X11/man directory in it's
man_db.config file</LI>
</UL>
<P>2.2 - April 3rd, 2000
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The linuxfromscratch.org and linuxfromscratch.com domains are now operational.
All former links to huizen.dds.nl/~glb and tts.ookhoi.dds.nl have been
replaced by the appropriate links on www.linuxfromscratch.org</LI>
<LI>After the reboot in chapter 7.3, the swap partition is made active before
we start compiling software.</LI>

the moderator(s) can do this). This list is primarily used for announcements
of new versions of this document.
<P>If you're subscribed to the lfs-discuss list you don't need to be subscribed
to the lfs-announce list as well. Everything that is sent over the lfs-announce
list is also sent over the lfs-discuss list.
