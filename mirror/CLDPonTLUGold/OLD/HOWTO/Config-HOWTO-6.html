<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Feedback</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Perhaps even more than other HOWTOs, this one needs and welcomes your
suggestions, criticisms, and contributions. Not only is feedback welcome:
it's necessary. If you think something is missing or wrong, please email me.
If you have a distribution other than Red Hat/Mandrake and your config files
are different or placed in other directories, please tell me and I'll
include your tips. My aim is making life with Linux as easy as possible.
<P>Linux has a huge number of packages, so it's impossible to include
directions for all of them. Please keep your requests/suggestions pertinent
to the ``most reasonable'' programs---I'll leave it to your common sense.

<P>Many thanks to all other HOWTO authors and man pages writers/maintainers,
whose work I've shamelessly pilfered; and to all people who provided me with
feedback.
<P>I hope you'll find this work useful, though. Whenever I install a new Linux
box, I actually do...
