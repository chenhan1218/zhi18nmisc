</H2>

<P>I want to thank Arnt Gulbrandsen whom I cause to suffer through the
drafts to this work and who provided many useful suggestions.  I also
want to thank the numerous people that have e-mailed suggestions and
notes.
<P>
<P>This will never be a finished document; please send me mail about
your problems and successes.  You can help make this a better HOWTO.
So please send comments and/or questions or money to janl@linpro.no.
Or buy my DNS book.  See the bibliography for information about that.
If you send e-mail and want an answer please show the simple courtesy
of <EM>making sure</EM> that the return address is correct and working.
Also, <B>please</B> read the 
<A HREF="DNS-HOWTO-10.html#qanda">qanda</A> section
before mailing me.  Another thing, I can only understand Norwegian and
English.
<P>
<P>This is a HOWTO.  I have maintained it as part of the LDP since
1995.  I have, during 2000, written a book on the same subject.  I
want to say that, though this HOWTO is in many ways much like the book
it is <EM>not</EM> a watered down version concocted to market the
book.  You will however find the book in the bibliography at the end
of this HOWTO.  The readers of this HOWTO have helped me understand
what is difficult to understand about DNS.  This has helped the book,
but the book has also helped me to think more about what this HOWTO
needs.  The HOWTO begot the book.  The book begot version 3 of this
HOWTO.  My thanks to the book publisher, Que, that took a chance on me
:-)

<P>This HOWTO is dedicated to Anne Line Norheim Langfeldt.  Though she
will probably never read it since she's not that kind of girl.
