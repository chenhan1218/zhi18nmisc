<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Configuring the other internal to-be MASQed machines </A></H2>

<P>Besides setting the appropriate IP address for each internal MASQed machine, you should also set each internal machine with the appropriate gateway IP address of the Linux MASQ server and required DNS servers. In general, this is rather straight forward. You simply enter the address of your Linux host (usually 192.168.0.1) as the machine's gateway address. 
<P>For the Domain Name Service, you can add in any DNS servers that are available. The most apparent one should be the one that your Linux server is using. You can optionally add any "domain search" suffix as well. 
<P>After you have properly reconfigured the internal MASQed machines, remember to restart their appropriate network services or reboot them. 
<P>The following configuration instructions assume that you are using a Class C network with 192.168.0.1 as your Linux MASQ server's address. Please note that 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.0.255 are reserved TCP/IP address. 
<P>
<P>As it stands, the following Platforms have been tested as internal MASQed machines.  This is only an EXAMPLE of all of the compatible OSes out there:
