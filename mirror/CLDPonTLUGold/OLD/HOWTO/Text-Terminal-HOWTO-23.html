<H2><A NAME="s23">23. Appendix D: Notes by Brand/Model</A></H2>

<P> Here are notes by brand name that were too specific to a certain
terminal to be put elsewhere in this HOWTO.  If you have some info to
contribute on a certain terminal that is not covered elsewhere, it
could go here.  Various models often have much in common which only
need be written about in one place.  It would be nice if for each
terminal model, there were a set of links linking to the documentation
relevant to that model (including escape codes).  There are so many
models of terminals that such a task would be quite onerous and I,
David Lawyer (as of 1998), have no intention of attempting this.  If
most terminal manufacturers would only make their manuals available on
the net, then all this might not be needed.  Note that some VT (DEC)
manuals are now available on the Internet.

<H2><A NAME="ss23.1">23.1 CIT</A>
</H2>

<P> CIT terminals were made in Japan in the 1980's for CIE Terminals.
They ceased to be imported in the late 1980's.  The company, CIE,
still makes CItoh printers (in 1997) but has no parts for its
abandoned terminals.  Ernie at (714) 453-9555 in Irvine CA sells (in
1997) some parts for models 224, 326, etc. but has nothing for the 80
and 101.  (The document you are now reading was written mostly on the
101e.)
<P>To save the Set-Up parameters press ^S when in Set-Up mode.
cit80: Contrast: knob on rear of terminal,
cit101e: Brightness: use up/down arrow keys in Set-Up mode.

<H2><A NAME="ibm_"></A> <A NAME="ss23.2">23.2 IBM Terminals </A>
</H2>

<P> Don't confuse IBM terminals with IBM PC monitors.  Many IBM
terminals don't use ASCII but instead use an 8-bit EBCDIC code.  It's
claimed that in EBCDIC the bit order of transmission is reversed from
normal with the high-order bit going first.  The IBM mainframe
communication standards are a type of synchronous communication in
block mode (sends large packets of characters).  Two standards are
"BISYNC" and "SNA" (which includes networking standards).  Many of
their terminals connect with coax cable (RG62A/U) and naive persons
may think the "BNC" connecter on the terminal is for ethernet (but
it's not).
<P>While this IBM system is actually  more efficient than what is
normally used in Linux, terminals meeting this IBM standard will not
currently work with Linux.  However, some IBM terminals are
asynchronous ASCII terminals and should work with Linux on PC's.  The
numbers 31xx may work with the exception that 317x and 319x are not
ASCII terminals.  Before getting an IBM terminal, make sure there is a
termcap (terminfo) for it.  If their isn't, it likely will not work
with Linux.  Even if there is a terminfo, it may not work.  For
example, there is a termcap for 327x but the 3270 is an EBCDIC
synchronous terminal.
<P>The 3270 series includes the 3278 (late 1970's), 3279 with color and
graphics, and the 3274 terminal controller (something like the 3174).
They may be used for both BISYNC and SNA.  The 3290 has a split screen
(splits into quarters).
<P>The synchronous IBM terminals don't connect directly to the IBM
mainframe, but connect to a "terminal controller" (sometimes called
"cluster controller" or "communication controller").  Some of these
controllers can convert a synchronous signal to asynchronous so that in
this case a synchronous terminal could indirectly connect to a
Unix-like host computer via its serial port.  But there is still a
major problem and that is block transmission.  See section 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-22.html#block">Block Mode</A>.

<P> It's claimed that the Aux port is DCE and uses a straight-thru
cable.

<H2><A NAME="teletype"></A> <A NAME="ss23.3">23.3 Teletypes </A>
</H2>

<P> These are antiques and represent the oldest terminals.  They are
like remotely controlled typewriters but are large and noisy.  Made by
the Teletype Corp., the first models were made in the 1920's and
predate the computer by over 30 years.  Early models used
electro-mechanical relays and rotating distributors instead of
electronics.  Their Baudot code was only 5-bits per character as
compared to 7-bit ASCII.  See the book "Small Computer Systems
Handbook" by Sol Libes, Hayden Books, 1978: pp. 138-141 ("Teletypes").

<H2><A NAME="ss23.4">23.4 VT (DEC)</A>
</H2>

<P> Digital Equipment Corporation made the famous VT series of
terminals including the commonly emulated VT100.  In 1995 they sold
their terminal business to SunRiver which is now named Boundless
Technologies.  Detailed VT terminal information, some manuals, and
history is at 
<A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/">http://www.vt100.net/</A>.  Other information is
available at 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html">Shuford's Website</A>.  Information on current products is available
from the Boundless website.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-20.html#internet_">Terminal Info on the Internet</A>.
<P>VT220: Some have a BNC connector for video output (not for input).
Sometimes people erroneously think this is for an ethernet connection.
<P>VT520: Supports full DTR/DSR flow control.
<P>Dorio: Can emulate many other terminals.  The "sco unix console" is
claimed to be a powerful emulation using the "scoansi" terminfo.

</H2>

<P> For specs on terminals see 
<A HREF="http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/wyseterm.asp">http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/wyseterm.asp</A>.  This
will also lead to some FAQ's for terminal numbers under 100 (such as
WY60).  For the specs on more recent terminals see See 
<A HREF="http://www.wyse.com/products/gpt/index.htm">Wyse terminals</A>.

<H3>Wyse 60</H3>

<P> Display adjustments (must remove cover): Brightness VR202, Height
VR302, Width VR101 (also affects height).  If you want to use it in
Native Personality, then the arrow-key codes will conflict with the
codes used in vi (such as ^L).  To fix this set "Application key mode"
with ESC &nbsp; 3.  This results in the arrow keys sending 0xd1 - 0xd4.
Due to a bug in the readline interface of the Bash shell, you need to
edit /etc/inputrc so that the arrow keys will work in Bash.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-16.html#bash_bug">Bugs in Bash</A>

    the default.

<P>HINTS on use of WY-99GT User's Guide:  
Note that much that is missing from this Guide may be found in the
WY-99GT Programmer's Guide.  The VT100 emulation (personality) is 
known as ANSI and uses ANSI key codes per p. A-10+ even though the
keyboard may be ASCII.  A sub-heading on p. A-13 "ASCII Keyboard" also
pertains to VT100 because it has an "ANSI KEY ..." super-heading a few
pages previously.  But not all ASCII keyboard headings pertain to
VT100 since they may fall under a non-ANSI personality super-heading
which may found be a few pages previously.  Appendix H is the "ANSI
Command Guide" except for the VT52 (ANSI) personality which is found
in Appendix G.
<P>
<H3>Wyse 150</H3>

<P> When exiting set-up using F12, hitting space changes "no" to "yes"
to save the set-up.  The sentence to the left of this no/yes is about
"vertical alignment" and has nothing to do with this no/yes for saving
the set-up (confusing menu design).
