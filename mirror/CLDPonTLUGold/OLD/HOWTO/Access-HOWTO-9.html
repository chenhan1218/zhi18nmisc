<H2><A NAME="memmap-braille"></A> <A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Braille terminals driven from Screen Memory</A>
</H2>

<P>These are Braille terminals that can read the screen memory
directly in a normal text mode.  It is possible to use it to work with
Linux for almost all of the things that a seeing user can do on the
console, including installation.  However, it has a problem with the
scrolling of the normal Linux kernel, so a kernel patch needs to be
applied.  See 
<A HREF="#memmap-patch">Patching the Kernel for Braillex and Brailloterm</A>.
<P>
<H3>Braillex </H3>

<P>The Braillex is a terminal which is designed to read directly from
the Screen memory, thus getting round any problems with MS-DOS
programs which don't behave strangely.  If you could see it on screen,
then this terminal should be able to display it in Braille.  In Linux,
unfortunately, screen handling is done differently from MS-DOS, so
this has to be changed somewhat.  
<P>To get this terminal to work, you have to apply the patch given below
in section 
<A HREF="#memmap-patch">Patching the Kernel</A>.  Once
this is done, the Braillex becomes one of the most convenient ways to
use Linux as it allows all of the information normally available to a
seeing person to be read.  Other terminals don't start working until
the operating system has completely booted.
<P>The Braillex is available with two arrangements of Braille cells (80x1
or 40x2) and there is a model, called the IB 2-D which also has a
vertical bar to show information about all of the lines of the screen
(using 4 programmable dots per screen line)
<P>

Price: 8,995  (pounds sterling) or 11495 UKP for 2-D

<H3>Brailloterm</H3>

<P>``What is Brailloterm?
<P>
<P>It's a refreshable display Braille, made by KTS
Kommunikations-Technik Stolper GmbH.  It has 80 Braille cells in an
unique line. Each cell has 8 dots that are combined (up/down) to
represent a character. By default, Brailloterm shows me the line in
which the screen cursor is. I can use some functions in Brailloterm to
see any line in the screen.'' - <I>Jose Vilmar Estacio de Souza</I>
<A HREF="mailto:jvilmar@embratel.net.br">&lt;jvilmar@embratel.net.br&gt;</A><P>
<P>Jose then goes on to say that the terminal can also use the serial
port under DOS but that it needs a special program.  I don't know if
any of the ones for Linux would work.
<P>
<P>As with Braillex, this needs a special patch to the kernel work
properly.  See section 
<A HREF="#memmap-patch">Patching the Kernel</A>.

<H3><A NAME="memmap-patch"></A> Patching the Kernel for Braillex and Brailloterm</H3>

<P>This probably also applies to any other terminals which read
directly from screen memory to work under MS-DOS.  Mail me to confirm
any terminals that you find work.  This does not apply and will
actually lose some features for terminals driven using the BRLTTY
software.
<P>
<P>I am told this patch applies to all Kernels version 1.2.X.  It
should also work on all Kernel versions from 1.1.X to 1.3.72, with
just a warning from patch (I've tested that the patch applies to
1.3.68 at least).  <B>From 1.3.75 the patch is no longer needed</B>
because the Kernel can be configured not to scroll using `<CODE>linux
no-scroll</CODE>' at the LILO prompt.  See the Boot Prompt HOWTO for more
details.

</OL>
<P>
<P>Apply those patches and you should be able to use the Braille terminal
as normal to read the Linux Console. 
<P>
<P>Put in words, the patch just means `change the 1 to a 0 in the
first line of the function <CODE>scrup</CODE> which should be near line 603 in the
file drivers/char/console.c'.  The main thing about <CODE>patch</CODE> is that
program understands this, and that it knows how to guess what to do
when the Linux developers change things in that file.
<P>
<P>If you want to use a more modern kernel with completely disabled
scrolling, (instead of the boot prompt solution I already mentioned),
please use the following patch.  <B>This does not apply to kernels
earlier than 1.3.75</B>.

<P>The principle of operation of these terminal is very close to that
of a CRT terminal such as the vt100.  They connect to the serial port
and the computer has to run a program which sends them output.  At
present there are two known programs for Linux.  <CODE>BRLTTY</CODE>, see section

<P>This Braille terminal is supported by the <CODE>BRLTTY</CODE>

The extra five cells over a standard display are used for status
information.

<H3>Braille Lite</H3>

<P>This is more a portable computer than a terminal.  It could,
however, be used with BRLTTY version 0.22 (but not newer versions) as
if it was a normal Braille terminal.  Unfortunately, many of the
features available with the CombiBraille cannot be used with the
Braille Lite.  This means that it should be avoided for Linux use
where possible.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Speech Synthesisers</A>
</H2>

<P>Speech synthesisers normally connect to the serial port of a PC.
Useful features include
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Braille labels on parts</LI>
<LI>Many voices to allow different parts of document to be spoken
differently </LI>
<LI>Use with headphones (not available on all models)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The critical problem is that the quality of the speech.  This is much
more important to someone who is using the speech synthesiser as their
main source of information than to someone who is just getting neat
sounds out of a game.  For this reason T.V. Raman seems to only
recommend the DECTalk.  Acceptable alternatives would be good.
<P>
<H3>DECTalk Express</H3>

<P>This is a hardware speech synthesiser.  It is recommended for use
with Emacspeak and in fact the DECTalk range are the only speech
synthesisers which work with that package at present.  This
synthesiser has every useful feature that I know about.  The only
disadvantage that I know of at present is price.

<H3>SPO256-AL2 Speak and Spell chip.</H3>

<P>Some interest has been expressed in using this chip in self built
talking circuits.  I'd be interested to know if anyone has found this
useful.  A software package <CODE>speak-0.2pl1.tar.gz</CODE> was produced by
David Sugar 
<A HREF="mailto:dyfet@tycho.com">&lt;dyfet@tycho.com&gt;</A>.  My suspicion, though, is
that the quality of the output wouldn't be good enough for regular use.
