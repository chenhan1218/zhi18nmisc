<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Configuring a NetRom port.</A></H2>

<P>The NetRom protocol relies on, and uses the AX.25 ports you have created.
The NetRom protocol rides on top of the AX.25 protocol. To configure NetRom
on an AX.25 interface you must configure two files. One file describes the
Netrom interfaces, and the other file describes which of the AX.25 ports
will carry NetRom. You can configure multiple NetRom ports, each with its
own callsign and alias, the same procedure applies for each.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Configuring <CODE>/etc/ax25/nrports</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>The first is the <CODE>/etc/ax25/nrports</CODE> file. This file describes
the NetRom ports in much the same way as the <CODE>/etc/ax25/axports</CODE>
file describes the AX.25 ports. Each NetRom device you wish to create
must have an entry in the <CODE>/etc/ax25/nrports</CODE> file. Normally
a Linux machine would have only one NetRom device configured that would
use a number of the AX.25 ports defined. In some situations you might
wish a special service such as a BBS to have a seperate NetRom alias and
so you would create more than one.
<P>This file is formatted as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
name callsign  alias  paclen   description
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Where:
<DL>
<DT><B>name</B><DD><P>is the text name that you wish to refer to the port by.
<DT><B>callsign</B><DD><P>is the callsign that the NetRom traffic from this port
will use. Note, this is <B>not</B> that address that users should connect
to to get access to a <EM>node</EM> style interface. (The node program is covered
later). This callsign/ssid should be unique and should not appear elsewhere
in either of the <CODE>/etc/ax25/axports</CODE> or the <CODE>/etc/ax25/nrports</CODE>
files.
<DT><B>alias</B><DD><P>is the NetRom alias this port will have assigned to it.
<DT><B>paclen</B><DD><P>is the maximum size of NetRom frames transmitted by this port.
<DT><B>description</B><DD><P>is a free text description of the port.
</DL>
<P>An example would look something like the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
netrom  VK2KTJ-9        LINUX   236     Linux Switch Port
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This example creates a NetRom port known to the rest of the NetRom network
as `<CODE>LINUX:VK2KTJ-9</CODE>'.
<P>This file is used by programs such as the <EM>call</EM> program.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Configuring <CODE>/etc/ax25/nrbroadcast</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>The second file is the <CODE>/etc/ax25/nrbroadcast</CODE> file. This file may
contain a number of entries. There would normally be one entry for each
AX.25 port that you wish to allow NetRom traffic on.
<P>This file is formatted as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
axport min_obs def_qual worst_qual verbose
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Where:
<DL>
<DT><B>axport</B><DD><P>is the port name obtained from the
<CODE>/etc/ax25/axports</CODE> file. If you do not have an entry in
<CODE>/etc/ax25/nrbroadcasts</CODE> for a port then this means that no NetRom
routing will occur and any received NetRom broadcasts will be ignored for that
port.
<DT><B>min_obs</B><DD><P>is the minimum obselesence value for the port.
<DT><B>def_qual</B><DD><P>is the default quality for the port.
<DT><B>worst_qual</B><DD><P>is the worst quality value for the port, any routes under
this quality will be ignored.
<DT><B>verbose</B><DD><P>is a flag determining whether full NetRom routing broadcasts
will occur from this port or only a routing broadcast advertising the node
itself.
</DL>
<P>An example would look something like the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
radio    1       200      100         1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Creating the NetRom Network device</A>
</H2>

<P>When you have the two configuration files completed you must create the
NetRom device in much the same way as you did for the AX.25 devices.
This time you use the <EM>nrattach</EM> command. The <EM>nrattach</EM> works in
just the same way as the <EM>axattach</EM> command except that it creates
NetRom network devices called `<CODE>nr[0-9]</CODE>'. Again, the first time you
use the <EM>nrattach</EM> command it creates the `<CODE>nr0</CODE>' device, the second
time it creates the `<CODE>nr1</CODE>' network devices etc. To create the network
device for the NetRom port we've defined we would use:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# nrattach netrom
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This command would start the NetRom device (<CODE>nr0</CODE>) named <CODE>netrom</CODE>
configured with the details specified in the <CODE>/etc/ax25/nrports</CODE>
file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Starting the NetRom daemon</A>
</H2>

<P>The Linux kernel does all of the NetRom protocol and switching, but does not
manage some functions. The NetRom daemon manages the NetRom routing tables
and generates the NetRom routing broadcasts. You start NetRom daemon with
the command:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /usr/sbin/netromd -i
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You should soon see the <CODE>/proc/net/nr_neigh</CODE> file filling up with
information about your NetRom neighbours.
<P>Remember to put the <CODE>/usr/sbin/netromd</CODE> command in your
<EM>rc</EM> files so that it is started automatically each time you reboot.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 Configuring NetRom routing. </A>
</H2>

<P>                                                                      
You may wish to configure static NetRom routes for specific hosts.
The <EM>nrparms</EM> command enables you to do this. Again, the <EM>man</EM> page
offers a complete description, but a simple example might be:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /usr/sbin/nrparms -nodes VK2XLZ-10 + #MINTO 120 5 radio VK2SUT-9
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This command would set a NetRom route to <CODE>#MINTO:VK2XLZ-10</CODE> via a neighbour
<CODE>VK2SUT-9</CODE> on my AX.25 port called `<CODE>radio</CODE>'.
<P>
<P>You can manually create entries for new neighbours using the <EM>nrparms</EM>
command as well. For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /usr/sbin/nrparms -routes radio VK2SUT-9 + 120
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This command would create <CODE>VK2SUT-9</CODE> as a NetRom neighbour with a quality
of <CODE>120</CODE> and this will be locked and will not be deleted automatically.
