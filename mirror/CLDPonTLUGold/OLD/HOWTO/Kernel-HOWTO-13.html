<P>
<P>The author and maintainer of the Linux Kernel-HOWTO is Brian Ward
(<CODE>bri@cs.uchicago.edu</CODE>). Please send me any comments, additions,
corrections (Corrections are, in particular, the most important to me.).
<P>
<P>You can take a look at my `home page' at one of these URLs:

</PRE>
<P>
<P>Even though I try to be attentive as possible with mail, please remember
that I get a <I>lot</I> of it every day, so it may take a little time to
get back to you. Especially when emailing me with a question, please try
extra hard to be clear and detailed in your message. If you're writing
about non-working hardware (or something like that), I need to know what
your hardware configureation is. If you report an error, don't just say
``I tried this but it gave an error;'' I need to know what the error was.
I would also like to know what versions of the kernel, gcc, and libc you're
using. If you just tell me you're using this-or-that distribution, it won't
tell me much at all. I don't care if you
ask simple questions; remember, if you don't ask, you may never get an
answer! I'd like to thank everyone who has given me feedback.
<P>If your question does not relate to the kernel, or is in some language that
I don't understand, I may not answer.
<P>
<P>If you mailed me and did not get an answer within a resonable amount of
time (three weeks or more), then chances are that I accidentally deleted your
message or something (sorry). Please try again.
<P>
<P>I get a lot of mail about thing which are actually hardware problems or
issues. That's OK, but please try to keep in mind that I'm not familiar
with all of the hardware in the world. I use AMD processors, Adaptec and
Sybios SCSI controllers, and IBM SCSI disks.

<P>Version -0.1 was written on October 3, 1994. This document is available in
SGML, PostScript, TeX, roff, and plain-text formats.

</H2>

<P>The ``Tips and tricks'' section is a little small. I hope to expand on it
with suggestions from others.
<P>So is ``Additional packages.''
<P>More debugging/crash recovery info needed.
