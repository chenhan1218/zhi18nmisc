This is a modified version of wdb-1.3a2 which provides a gateway to a the
WWW for PostgreSQL. This version also requires a Browser that is capable of
handling HTML Tables for the tabular output. This is not required by the
original wdb and can be fairly easily reverted.
<P>You can try out CASI Tape and Image Query. You can have a peek at the
Form Definition File (FDF) which is used to create the CASI Tape and Image
Query too, which includes a JOIN of 2 tables.
<P>This release contains all files necessary to install and run WDB-P95 as an
interface to your PostgreSQL databases. To port this system to other
database should be relatively easy - provided that it supports standard SQL
and has a Perl interface.
<H2><A NAME="ss24.2">24.2 Does the PostgreSQL server, pgperl, and httpd have to be on the same host?</A>
</H2>

<P>No - the PostgreSQL server does not have to be on the same host. As WDB-P95
is called by the http daemon, they have to be on the same host. - And as
WDB-P95 was written to use Pg.pm - pgperl has to be on the same host too.
Pgperl was written using the libpq library, so it will be able to access
any PostgreSQL server anywhere in the net, just like any other PostgreSQL
client. As illustrated below
<P>(WWW Client (Netscape)) => (HTTP Server (NCSA's http) + WDB-P95 + pgperl + libpq)=> (PostgreSQL server)
<P>Curly brackets () represent machines.
<P>Each machine can be of a different type : NT, SUN, HP, ... but you need the
libpq interface library for the machine type where you plan to use WDB-P95,
as you need it to compile pgperl. (The system was designed to use HTML
tables so a recent WWW client is best)
