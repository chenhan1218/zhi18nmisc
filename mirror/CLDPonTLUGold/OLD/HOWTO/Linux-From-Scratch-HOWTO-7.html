<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Installing basic system software</A> </H2>

<P>In this chapter we will install all the software that belongs to a basic
Linux system. After you're done with this chapter you have a fully working
Linux system. The remaining chapters deals with optional issues such as setting
up networking, Internet servers + clients (telnet, ftp, http, email), setting
up Internet itself and the X Window System. You can skip chapters at your own
discretion. If you don't plan on going online with the LFS system there's little
use to setup Internet for example.
<P>There are a number of packages that need to be already installed before
we can start installing all the basic system software. A typical configure
scripts needs programs like rm, grep, sed, mv, cat, cp, diff. You need to be
able to ungzip and untar archives, you need to link programs after you have
compiled the objects files. All these (and a few more) programs needs to be
available before we can install anything else. These programs are going to
be linked statically. The reasoning behind this is that your normal Linux system
may have a different C Library version than the LFS system is going to have.
The programs you install in this section will be linked against the C Library
of your normal Linux system. This may cause library conflicts if you run those
programs on the LFS system. Therefore we have to link those programs statically.
During the installation of the basic system software set, we will re-install
the statically linked software so that they are linked dynamically against
the C library on the LFS system.
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 About debugging symbols</A>
 </H2>

<P>Every program and library is default compiled with debugging symbols. This
means you can run a program or library through a debugger and the debugger's
output will be more user friendly. These debugging symbols also enlarge the
program or binary significantly. This document will not install software without
debugging symbols (as I don't know if the majority of readers do or don't debug
software). In stead, you can remove those symbols manually if you want with
the <CODE>strip</CODE> program.
<P>To remove debugging symbols from a binary (must be an a.out or ELF binary)
run <CODE>strip --strip-debug filename</CODE> You can use wild cards if you need to strip
debugging symbols from multiple files (use something like <CODE>strip --strip-debug
$LFS/usr/bin/*</CODE>).
<P>Before you wonder if these debugging symbols would make a big difference,
here are some statistics:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A static Bash binary with debugging symbols: 2.3MB</LI>
<LI>A static Bash binary without debugging symbols: 645KB</LI>
<LI>A dynamic Bash binary with debugging symbols: 1.2MB</LI>
<LI>A dynamic Bash binary without debugging symbols: 478KB</LI>
<LI>$LFS/usr/lib (glibc and gcc files) with debugging symbols: 87MB</LI>
<LI>$LFS/usr/lib (glibc and gcc files) without debugging symbols: 16MB</LI>
</UL>
<P>Sizes may vary depending on which compiler has been used and which C library
version is used to link dynamic programs against, but your results will be
very similar if you compare programs with and without debugging symbols. After
I was done with this chapter and stripped all debugging symbols from all LFS
binaries and libraries I regained a little over 102 MB of disk space. Quite
the difference. The difference would be even greater when I would do this at
the end of this document when everything is installed.

<H3>Installing GCC on the normal system if necessary </H3>

<P>In order to compile Glibc-2.1.3 you need to have gcc-2.95.2 installed.
Any version from 2.8 and up would do, but 2.95.2 is recommended. Many glibc-2.0
based systems have gcc-2.7.2.3 installed and you can't compile glibc-2.1 with
that compiler. Therefore we will install gcc-2.95.2. also on the normal system,
but without overwriting the existing compiler. Before you install gcc on your
normal system, make sure whether you need it or not. Run <CODE>gcc --version</CODE> and
check if the version number it reports equals or is higher than 2.8. If not,
you need to install gcc-2.95.2. If you experience difficulties compiling glibc
later on, you might want to install gcc-2.95.2 anyways.

<H3>Creating necessary symlinks </H3>

<P>The system needs a few symlinks to ensure every program is able to find
the compiler and the pre-processor. Some programs run the cc program, others
run the gcc program, some programs expect the cpp program to be in /lib (which
is /usr/lib on the LFS system) and others expect to find it in /usr/bin.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create those symlinks by running:</LI>

installed (i686-unknown-linux in my case). You will most likely find two different
directories.

<P>A note on the glibc-crypt package:
<P>
<PRE>
-*-*-*-*-*-
The add-on is not included in the main distribution of the GNU 
C library because some governments, mostly notable those of 
France, Russia and the US, have very restrictive rules 
governing the distribution and use of encryption software. 
Please read the node "Legal Problems" in the manual for more 
details.
 
In particular, the US does not allow export of this software 
without a license, including via the Internet. So please do not 
download it from the main FSF FTP site at ftp.gnu.org if you 
are outside of the US. This software was completely developed 
outside the US.

<P>"This software" refers to the glibc-crypt package at ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/glibc/.
This law only affects people who don't live in the US. It's not prohibited
to import DES software, so if you live in the US you can import it from that
German site.

<H3>Copying old NSS Library files </H3>

<P>If your normal Linux system runs libc-2.0.x, you need to copy the NSS library
files to the LFS partition. Certain statically linked programs still depend
on the NSS library, especially programs that need to lookup usernames, userid's
and groupid's. You can check which C Library version your normal Linux system
uses by running: <CODE>ls -l libc.so.*</CODE>
<P>Your system uses glibc-2.0 if the output looks like: /lib/libc.so.6 -&gt;
libc-2.0.7.so
<P>Your system uses glibc-2.1 is the output looks like: /lib/libc.so.6 -&gt;
libc-2.1.2.so
<P>If your have a libc-2.0.x.so file (where x is the micro version number
such as 7) copy the NSS Library files by running: <CODE>cp -av /lib/*nss* $LFS/lib</CODE>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Installing basic systsem software</A>
 </H2>

<P>The installation of all the software is pretty straightforward and you'll
think it's so much easier and shorter to give the generic installation instructions
for each package and only explain how to install something if a certain package
requires an alternate installation method. Although I agree with you on this
aspect, I, however, choose to give the full instructions for each and every
package. This is simply to avoid any possible confusion and errors. Before
you continue with this document you have to restart your system and boot into
the LFS system. But before you do that, you need to determine which partition
is used as your swap partition. This information can usually be found in the
/etc/fstab file. Check this file for a line similar to this one: <EM>/dev/hda6
none swap sw 0 0</EM>
<P>The 4th field in a line must contain 'sw'. That line represents a swap
partition. All you need to remember is it's designation (which is /dev/hda6
in my case but this will probably be different on your system). When you have
determined which partition is the swap partition, you can reboot your computer
now and continue from here.
<H3>Remounting partition and activating swap </H3>

<P>Before the software can be installed we need to remount the partition in
read-write mode. Also, we need to activate the swap partition so that we won't
risk running out of memory during large compilation processes (such as compiling
gcc):

<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Removing old NSS Library files</A>
 </H2>

<P>If you have copied the NSS Library files from your normal Linux system
to the LFS system (because your normal system runs glibc-2.0) it's time to
remove them now by running:
<P>
<PRE>
rm /lib/libnss*.so.1 /lib/libnss*2.0*
 
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Configuring the software</A>
 </H2>

<P>Now that all software is installed, all that we need to do to get a few
programs running properly is to create their configuration files.
<H3>Configuring Glib </H3>

<P>We need to create the /etc/nsswitch.conf file. Although glibc should provide
defaults when this file is missing or corrupt, it's defaults don't work work
well with networking which will be dealt with in a later chapter. Also, our
timezone needs to be setup.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create a new file /etc/nsswitch.conf containing:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
# Begin /etc/nsswitch.conf
passwd: files
group: files
shadow: files
 
hosts: files dns
networks: files
 
protocols: db files
services: db files
ethers: db files
rpc: db files
 
netgroup: db files
# End /etc/nsswitch.conf
 
</PRE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Run the tzselect script and answer the questions regarding your timezone</LI>
<LI>When you're done, the program will give you the file location you need.</LI>
<LI>Create the localtime symlink by running: ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/&lt;tzselect's
output&gt; /etc/localtime</LI>
</UL>
<P>tzselect's output can be something like "EST5EDT" or "Canada/Eastern". The
symlink you would create with that information would be ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/EST5EDT
/etc/localtime or ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Canada/Eastern /etc/localtime
<H3>Configuring LILO </H3>

<P>We're not going to create lilo's configuration file from scratch, but we'll
use the file from your normal Linux system. This file is different on every
machine and thus I can't create it here. Since you would want to have the same
options regarding lilo as you have when you're using your normal Linux system
you would create the file exactly as it is on the normal system.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create the /mnt/original directory</LI>
<LI>Mount your normal Linux system on this mount point by running mount /dev/xxx
/mnt/original (replace /dev/xxx with your normal partition's designation).</LI>
<LI>Copy the lilo configuration file and kernel images that lilo uses by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
cp /mnt/original/etc/lilo.conf /etc
cp /mnt/original/boot/* /boot
 
</PRE>
<P>If your normal Linux system does not have (all of) it's kernel images in
/mnt/original/boot, then check your /etc/lilo.conf file for the location of
those files and copy those as well to the location where /etc/lilo.conf expects
them to be. Or you can copy them to /boot regardless and modify the /etc/lilo.conf
file so it contains the new paths for the images as you have them on the LFS
system. Either way works fine, it's up to you how you want to do it.
<H3>Configuring Sysklogd </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create the /var/log directory by running: mkdir /var/log</LI>
<LI>Create the /etc/syslog.conf file containing the following:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
# Begin /etc/syslog.conf
 
auth,authpriv.* -/var/log/auth.log
*.*;auth,authpriv.none -/var/log/sys.log
daemon.* -/var/log/daemon.log

mail.* -/var/log/mail.log
user.* -/var/log/user.log

# End /etc/syslog.conf
 
</PRE>
<H3>Configuring Shadow Password Suite </H3>

<P>This package contains the utilities to modify user's passwords, add new
users/groups, delete users/groups and more. I'm not going to explain to you
what 'password shadowing' means. You can read all about that in the doc/HOWTO
file. There's one thing you should keep in mind, if you decide to use shadow
support, that programs that need to verify passwords (examples are xdm, ftp
daemons, pop3d, etc) need to be 'shadow-compliant', eg. they need to be able
to work with shadowed passwords.
<P>If you decide you don't want to use shadowed passwords (after you're read
the doc/HOWTO document), you still use this archive since the utilities in
this archive are also used on system which have shadowed passwords disabled.
You can read all about this in the HOWTO. Also note that you can switch between
shadow and non-shadow at any point you want.
<P>Now is a very good moment to read section #5 of the doc/HOWTO file.
You can read how you can test if shadowing works and if not, how to disable
it. If it doesn't work and you haven't tested it, you'll end up with an unusable
system after you logout of all your consoles, since you won't be able to login
anymore. You can easily fix this by passing the init=/sbin/sulogin parameter
to the kernel, unpack the util-linux archive, go to the login-utils directory,
build the login program and replace the /bin/login by the one in the util-linux
package. Things are never hopelessly messed up (at least not under Linux),
but you can avoid a hassle by testing properly and reading manuals ;)
<H3>Configuring Sysvinit </H3>

<P>After you have made the following modification to the /etc/inittab file,
you will be able to logon to it as you are used to (using the agetty and login
programs). Sulogin won't be used anymore for normal logins.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Edit the /etc/inittab file and modify it so it contains the following:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
# Begin /etc/inittab

# End /etc/inittab

<H3>Creating /var/run/utmp file </H3>

<P>Programs like login, shutdown and others want to write to the /var/run/utmp
file. This file contains information about who is currently logged in. It also
contains information on when the computer was last shutdown. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create the /var/run/utmp file by running: touch /var/run/utmp</LI>
<LI>Give it the proper file permissions by running: chmod 644 /var/run/utmp</LI>
