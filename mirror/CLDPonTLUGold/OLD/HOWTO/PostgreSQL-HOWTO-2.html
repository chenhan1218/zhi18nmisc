<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Laws of Physics apply to Software!</A></H2>

<P>In this chapter, it will be shown how science plays an important role in the creation of
various objects like software, this universe, mass, atoms, energy and even yourself! 
This chapter also shows why knowledge of science is very important before you start 
using the products of science.
<P>The golden rule is - <I>"You MUST not use a product without 
understanding how it is created!!"</I> This rule applies
to everything - database sytems, computer system, operating system, this universe and 
even your own human body! It means that you should have complete source 
code and information about the system. It is important to understand how human body
and atoms inside human body works since humans are creating PostgreSQL, MS Windows95 etc..
<P>Creation is a very important step. Persons who are using the objects of science
must know how it is created. This applies to even computer systems and PostgreSQL.
A majority of people do not have knowledge of science and hence do not 
know how systems like MS Windows NT/95, Oracle, human body and this universe are 
created. A vast majority of people do not 
know what made the universe and MS Windows 95/NT
and what is inside it. Complex systems are built from very
simple basic building blocks like - millions of universes are created, 
each universe in turn has millions of super-clusters, each super-cluster has 
millions of galaxies, each galaxy has millions of stars, some stars 
have many planets, each planet in turn is made up 
billions of atoms.<I>(In the history of this world, <B>only one universe was 
created by a man</B> in ancient India eons ago, but no other case had been 
reported in the modern history. There is only one man-made universe)</I> Creating 
an universe is a much more advanced 
technology and is more advanced than the atomic bomb which was dropped on 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki causing 
<B>horrible destruction</B>. 
Modern nuclear weapons are so tiny and powerful 
that if such a single nuclear bomb is dropped in pacific ocean then it 
can completely vaporise the planet earth! 
The total variety of weapons are infinity. There are weapons to
even terminate the universes (it is not a good idea to give nuke weapons
technology to every person). Nuclear weapons and other 
more <B>powerful divine weapons</B> were used 
in the battle field in ancient India! Nobody believed Albert 
Eienstein (a scientist of 1900's) when he said nuclear weapons can 
be made which can vaporise big cities. 
<P>Software like MS Windows 95 is created simply by "C"
and assembler language programs which simply uses 1 and 0 and <I><B>universes like 
ours are created simply by dashing TWO dissimilar but proper of combination of 
tiny atomic particles of other dimensions.</B></I>
<I>(Something interesting happened <B>just before</B> dashing of tiny particles)</I>
A human body is created by dashing two dissimilar but 
proper combination of tiny cells!! 
<I>(Something interesting happened <B>just before</B> dashing of tiny cells)</I>
Humans inherited the properties of this universe.
The universe you are
currently living in was NOT there - all the atoms inside the universe was not there 
and not even TIME was existing!! Baby universe was born during <B>big bang</B> and
started expanding and kept growing. Even today our universe is still expanding and
is not static!! 
A person from another universe by name <B>'Brahma'</B> created 
this universe you are currently living in. 
<I><B>Knowledge is the MOTHER of this universe!!</B></I>
'Brahma' loved on 'Mother knowledge' before the baby universe in which 
you are living was born!!
It is a deal similar to how you were born! 
Without any 'genes' from
Mother Knowledge it is not possible create even a small "C" program!
<P>At some point our universe will close down (in a big crunch) and all 
the atoms inside the universe will completely vanish and dissappear!
All the atoms that you see inside this universe will be gone!
<P>Total number of universes that can be created 
is <B>INFINITY</B> and similarly total number of operating systems that 
can be created is also <B>infinity</B>!! It is infinite cyclic process
where universes are born and then later die down. There are millions of universes,
which are classified into 3 major categories. 
Infinite number universes and infinite
variety of multi-dimensional atoms collapse down 
into few <I>primary-dimensional-universe</I>. And primary-dimensional universes collapse
down into one single focus entity called <I>'eeshwar'</I> 
(eeshara is a <B><I>sanskrit</I></B> word).
Very advanced mathematical equations support this theory.
<P>The laws of science and statistics favour the open-source 
code system like PostgreSQL and Linux. 
As the internet speed is increasing everyday, and
internet is becoming more and MORE reliable, the open-source code system will 
gain very rapid momentum.
And, if rules of statistics and laws of physics are correct, awareness of science
grows and when <B>IGNORANT</B> people start learning science then the 
closed source-code systems will eventually vanish from this planet.
<P>Developing a project like PostgreSQL requires resources like energy and time, hence
PostgreSQL is a product of energy and time.
Since energy and time can be explained only by 
science, there is a direct co-relation between 
physics and software projects like PostgreSQL, Linux.
Laws of science (Physics) applies everywhere and at all the times,
to anything that you do, even while you are developing the software projects.
<P>Physics is in action even while you are talking (sound waves), walking 
(friction between ground and your feet), reading a book or writing software. 
Every science in this world has a deep root in mathematics, including
PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL uses 'Modern Algebra' which is a tiny branch of mathematics.
Modern algebra deals with 'Set Theory', 'Relational Algebra', science of Groups, Rings, 
Collections, Sets, Unions, Intersections, Exclusions, Domains, Lists, etc...
<P>The software like PostgreSQL is existing today because of the energy and time.
And mass and energy are ONE and the <B>SAME</B> entity.
There are infinite number of methods to <I>unlock</I> mass and 
convert it into enery. Mass is a highly concentrated energy.
The fact that mass and energy are same was unknown to people 100 years ago!
And even <B>today</B> it is unknown to world population that internet is the 
largest software "power house" and the largest "software company" in the world!
<P>Cells in the human brains consume energy while processing
(creating software), by converting the chemical energy from food into electrical and 
heat energy.
Even while you are reading this paragraph, the cells in your brain are burning out the
fuel and are using tiny amounts of energy.
All of these implies that human brain is a thermodynamic heat engine.
Because human brain is a thermodynamic engine, the laws of thermodynamics applies to brain
and hence thermodynamics has indirect effects on software like PostgreSQL.
<P>There can be infinite number of colors, computer langauages, computer chip designs and
theories but there CANNOT be ONE SINGLE PERFECT color, computer language, design or system!
What you can have is only a  NEAR PERFECT color(wavelength), system, database, or theory!
<B>Nature is like a <I>KALIEDOSCOPE</I></B> - there are infinite number of dimensions, infinite variety 
particles of other dimensions but they all combine into very few primary 
dimensions and vice-versa. 
<P>By combining the energies of
millions of people around the world via internet it is possible to achieve
a <B>NEAR PERFECT</B> system (including a database software system). Individually, 
the energy of each
person will be minute, but by networking a large number of people, the
total energy will be huge which can be focused on a 
project to generate a near perfect system.
<P>The energy is measured in Joules, kiloJoules or kilograms of mass, and time is
measured in seconds or hours.
And power is energy divided by time and is measured in Watts or kiloWatts .
<HR>
<PRE>
        Energy of each person = y Joules
or in terms of mass
        Energy of each person = y grams
The conversion factor between mass and energy is E = m * c * c  
where 'c' is the speed of light and 'm' is the mass.
        Time = 8 hours (This is constant since each person has only 8 hours a day)
        Power = Energy / Time
                  = (y / (8 * 60 * 60) ) Watts
        Total Power of the world = n * (y / (8 * 60 * 60) ) Watts
where n = number of persons working on the project.
</PRE>
<HR>

From the above equation it is clear that increasing the 'n' will greatly improve
the quality of product. Greater the 'n' then greater will be the power (in KiloWatts).
You can wonder how much total 
energy (in KiloJoules) and total power (in KiloWatts)
the global internet can focus on a system like Linux and PostgreSQL!
<P>It is very clear that internet can network a vast number of people, which implies
internet has a lot of energy and time which can produce much higher quality 
software products in much shorter time as 
compared to commercial companies. Even very big companies like Microsoft 
and IBM cannot overpower and overrule the laws of Physics but 
will eventually <B>SURRENDER UNTO</B> laws of science!
<P>Conclusion is - because of laws of science, 'open source code' system like PostgreSQL, Linux
will prevail and will be always much better than 'closed source code' system 
and it is possible to prove this statement scientifically. Man should not waste 
time creating too many duplicate software products.
