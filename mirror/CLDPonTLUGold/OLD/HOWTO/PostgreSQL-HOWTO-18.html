<H2><A NAME="s18">18. Web-Application-Servers for PostgreSQL</A></H2>

<P>Several Web-Application-Servers work with PostgreSQL both open-source and
commercial versions. The popular open-source Web-Application-Servers are
Perl based Application Servers like Mason, WIRM, Velocigen,
Enhydra(Java) and Zope(Python) and commercial Web-Application-Servers are IBM Websphere,
BEA Weblogic. 
<P>It is recommeded that you use secure web server like Apache + mod_ssl + OpenSSL.
See Redhat StrongHold secure server at 
<A HREF="http://www.c2.net/products/sh3">http://www.c2.net/products/sh3</A>.
<P>Web Application Servers can be classified according to the
programming language which they support.
You must choose a Web Application server based on the 
programming language which <B>you like the most</B>. 
<P>Classifications of Web Application servers are:
<UL>
<LI> Based on <B>PERL</B> language</LI>
<LI> Based on <B>PHP</B> language (which is similar to PERL, little Java-like)</LI>
<LI> Based on <B>Python</B> language (Object oriented scripting language)</LI>
<LI> Based on <B>Java</B> language (Sun Microsystems Java)</LI>
<LI> Based on <B>Tcl</B> language (Tcl/Tk - called "Tickle" scripting language)</LI>
<LI> Based on <B>C++</B> language (C++ and CORBA)</LI>
<LI> Based on <B>Pike</B> (C++ like scripting language)</LI>

<H2><A NAME="perlserv"></A> <A NAME="ss18.1">18.1 PERL Web Application Servers </A>
</H2>

<P>Perl language has a very long life just like "C" language, and Perl will be 
in use for <B>a long time </B> in the future! Perl runs <B>3 times</B>
faster than Java for some operations (but Java runs faster than perl 
for some operations).
Java is a very complex system with virtual machine and interpreter which makes
it extremely slow, unstable and unreliable. Perl is very simple, fast and object oriented.
<P>Also Perl programs can be easily compiled for even better performance. Use
Perl2Exe which is a command line utility for converting
perl scripts to executable files

<LI> Apache-Perl integration project
With mod_perl it is possible to write Apache modules entirely in Perl. In addition,
the persistent interpreter embedded in the server avoids the overhead of starting an
external interpreter and the penalty of Perl start-up time.

are also many powerful extensions, including XML taglibs, XSLT 
rendering, and new events not originally part of the ASP API.

<LI> WIRM (Web Interface Repository Manager) is a Perl-based 
application server that provides a
high-level programming environment for developing web
information systems. The WIRM consists of an
object-relational database and a suite of Perl interfaces for
visualizing, integrating and analyzing heterogeneous
multimedia data. WIRM provides facilities for creating
context-sensitive views over a multimedia database,
allowing developers to rapidly build dynamic web sites that
adapt their content and presentation to multiple classes of
end-users.

Embperl gives you the power to embed Perl code in your HTML documents. Using Perl
means being able to use a very elaborate programming language, which is widely
used for WWW purposes. You can also use hundreds of Perl modules which have
already been written - including DBI - for database access to a growing number of
database systems.

<LI> ePerl 
<A HREF="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/eperl">http://www.engelschall.com/sw/eperl</A>
interprets an ASCII file bristled with Perl 5 program statements
by evaluating the Perl 5 code while passing through the plain ASCII
data. It can operate in various ways: As a stand-alone Unix filter or
integrated Perl 5 module for general file generation tasks and as a
powerful Webserver scripting language for dynamic HTML page
programming.

<LI> AxKit 
<A HREF="http://www.axkit.org">http://www.axkit.org</A> is an XML Application Server for 
Apache (and mod_perl). It provides 
on-the-fly conversion from XML to any format, such as
HTML, WAP or text using either W3C standard techniques, or 
flexible custom code. AxKit also uses a built-in Perl
interpreter to provide some amazingly powerful techniques for XML transformation. 

The emphasis with AxKit is on separation of content from 
presentation. The pipelining technique that AxKit uses
allows content to be converted to a presentable format in 
stages, allowing certain platforms to see data differently to
others. AxKit allows web designers to focus on web site
design, content developers to work on a purely content basis,
and webmasters to focus on their core competencies.</LI>

VelociGen also makes new development easier with server-side XML tags, crash protection
and load balancing across multiple machines. 

VelociGen plugs seamlessly into any Web server on any platform, increasing
server performance and speeding the response
times of dynamic content driven web sites. VelociGen can process large volumes 
of simultaneous requests as much as 10x faster than Java Servlets
and 4x faster than Cold Fusion.
