<H2><A NAME="s5">5. FAQ: Requirements?</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 What are the system requirements?</A>
</H2>

<P>A Linux PC, PCI 2.1 compliant, a monitor capable 
of 640x480, and a 3D accelerator board based on
the 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics (tm). It will work on a P5 or P6,
with or without MMX. The current version does not
use MMX, but it has some optimized code paths for P6. 
<P>At one point, some 3Dfx statements seemed to
imply that using Linux Glide required using a
RedHat distribution. Note that while
Linux Glide has originally been ported in a
RedHat 4.1 environment, it has been used and
tested with many other Linux distributions,
including homebrew, Slackware, and Debian 1.3.1.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Does it work with Linux-Alpha?</A>
</H2>

<P>There is currently no Linux Glide distribution available
for any platform besides i586. As the Glide sources are
not available for distribution, you will have to
wait for the binary. Quantum3D has DEC Alpha support
announced for 2H97. Please contact Daryll Strauss
if you are interested in supporting this.
<P>There is also the issue of porting the the assembly
modules. While there are alternative C paths in the
code, the assembly module in Glide (essentially
triangle setup) offered significant performance gains
depending on the P5 CPU used.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Which 3Dfx chipsets are supported? </A>
</H2>

<P>Currently, the  3Dfx Voodoo Graphics (tm) chipset is supported
under Linux. The Voodoo Rush (tm) chipset is not yet supported.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Is the Voodoo Rush (tm) supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>The current port of Glide to Linux does not support
the Voodoo Rush (tm). An update is in the works.
<P>The problem is that at one point the Voodoo Rush (tm) driver
code in Glide depended on Direct Draw. There was
an SST96 based DOS portion in the library that could
theoretically be used for Linux, as soon as all
portions residing in the 2D/Direct Draw/D3D combo
driver are replaced.
<P>Thus Voodoo Rush (tm) based boards like the 
<EM>Hercules Stingray 128/3D</EM>
or <EM>Intergraph Intense Rush</EM> are not supported
yet.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Which boards are supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are no officially supported boards, as 3Dfx does
not sell any boards. This section does not attempt to 
list all boards, it will just give an overview, and
will list only boards that have been found to cause
trouble.
<P>It is important to recognize that Linux support for a given
board does not only require a driver for the 3D accelerator
component. If a board features its own VGA core as well,
support by either Linux SVGA or XFree86 is required as well
(see section about Voodoo Rush (tm) chipset).
Currently, an add-on solution is recommended, as it allows
you to choose a regular graphics board well supported for
Linux. There are other aspects discussed below.
<P>All Quantum3D Obsidian boards, independend of texture
memory, frame buffer memory, number of Pixelfx and
Texelfx units, and SLI should work. Same for all other
Voodoo Graphics (tm) based boards, like  Orchid Righteous 3D, Canopus
Pure 3D, Flash 3D, and Diamond Monster 3D.
Voodoo Rush (tm) based boards are not yet supported.
<P>Boards that are not based on 3Dfx chipsets (e.g. manufactured
by S3, Matrox, 3Dlabs, Videologic) do <EM>not</EM> work with the 3Dfx
drivers and are beyond the scope of this document.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 How do boards differ?</A>
</H2>

<P>As the board manufacturers are using the same chipset,
any differences are due to board design. Examples are
quality of the pass-through cable and connectors
(reportedly, Orchid provided better quality than
Diamond), availability of a TV-compliant video
signal output (Canopus Pure 3D), and, most notably,
memory size on board.
<P>Most common were boards for games
with 2MB texture cache and 2 MB framebuffer memory,
however, the Canopus Pure3D comes with a maximal
4 MB texture cache, which is an advantage e.g.
with games using dynamically changed textures,
and/or illumation textures (Quake, most notably).
The memory architecture of a typical Voodoo Graphics (tm)
board is described below, in a separate section.
<P>Quantum 3D offers the widest selection of 3Dfx-based
boards, and is probably the place to go if you are
looking for a high end Voodoo Graphics (tm) based board configuration.
Quantum 3D is addressing the visual simulation market,
while most of the other vendors are only targetting the
consumer-level PC-game market.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 What about AGP?</A>
</H2>

<P>There is no Voodoo Graphics (tm) or Voodoo Rush (tm) AGP board that I am
aware of. I am not aware of AGP support under Linux,
and I do not know whether upcmong AGP boards using
3Dfx technology might possibly be supported with
Linux.
