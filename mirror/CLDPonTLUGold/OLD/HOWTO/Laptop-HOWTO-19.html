<P>As mentioned in the introduction laptops sometimes have less resources if you compare them to desktops. To deal with limited space, memory, CPU speed and battery power, I have written this chapter.

<H2><A NAME="ss19.3">19.3 Small Space</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>There are different types of techniques to gain more disk space, such as sharing of space, freeing unused or redundant space, filesystem tuning and compression. Note: some of these techniques use memory instead of space. As you will see, there are many small steps necessary to free some space.

<LI>Stripping: Though many distributions come with stripped binaries today it is useful to check this. For details see <CODE>man strip</CODE>. To find every unstripped file you can use the <CODE>file</CODE> command or more convenient the tool <CODE>findstrip</CODE>. Attention: don't strip libraries, sometimes the wrong symbols are removed due to a bad programming technique. Or use the <CODE>--strip-unneeded</CODE> option.</LI>
<LI>Perforation: <CODE>zum(1)</CODE>reads a file list on stdin and attempts to perforate these files. Perforation means, that series of null bytes are replaced by <CODE>lseek</CODE>, thus giving the file system a chance of not allocating real disk space for those bytes. Example: <CODE>find . -type f | xargs zum</CODE> </LI>
<LI>Remove Odd Files and Duplicates: Check your system for core files, emacs recovery files &lt;#FILE#&gt; vi recovery files &lt;FILE&gt;.swp, RPM recovery files &lt;FILE&gt;.rpmorig and <CODE>patch</CODE> recovery files. Find duplicates, you may try <CODE>finddup</CODE>. Choose a system to name your backup, temporary and test files, e.g. with a signature at the end.
</LI>
<LI>Clean Temporary Files: , e.g. /tmp, there is even a tool <CODE>tmpwatch</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>Shorten the Log Files: usually the files in /var/log. </LI>
<LI>Remove Files: Remove files which are not &quot;necessary&quot; under all circumstances such as man pages, documentation /usr/doc and sources e.g. /usr/src .
</LI>
<LI>Unnecessary Libraries: You may use the <CODE>binstats</CODE> package to find unused libraries (Thanks to Tom Ed White).
</LI>
<LI>Filesystem: Choose a filesystem which treats disk space economically e.g. <CODE>rsfs</CODE>. Tune your filesystem e.g. <CODE>tune2fs</CODE>. Choose an appropriate partition and block size. </LI>
<LI>Reduce Kernel Size: Either by using only the necessary kernel features and/or making a compressed kernel image <CODE>bzImage</CODE>. </LI>
<LI>Compression: I didn't check this but AFAIK you may compress your filesystem with <CODE>gzip</CODE> and decompress it on the fly. Alternatively you may choose to compress only certain files. You can even execute compressed files with <CODE>zexec</CODE></LI>
<LI>Compressed Filesystems:
<P>- For e2fs filesystems there is a compression version available <CODE>e2compr</CODE> , see 
<A HREF="http://debs.fuller.edu/e2compr/">http://debs.fuller.edu/e2compr/</A> .
<P>- DMSDOS which enables your machine to access Windows95 compressed drives (drivespace, doublestacker). If you don't need DOS/Windows95 compatibility, i.e. if you want to compress Linux-only data, this is really discouraged by the author of the program. See 
<A HREF="http://fb9nt-ln.uni-duisburg.de/mitarbeiter/gockel/software/dmsdos/">http://fb9nt-ln.uni-duisburg.de/mitarbeiter/gockel/software/dmsdos/</A> .
</LI>
<LI>Partition Sharing: You may share swap-space (see Swap-Space-HOWTO) or data partitions between different OS (see <CODE>mount</CODE>). For mounting MS-DOS Windows95 compressed drives (doublespace, drivespace) you may use <CODE>dmsdos</CODE> 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/"> http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/</A>.</LI>
<LI>Libraries: Take another (older) library, for instance <CODE>libc5</CODE> , this library seems to be smaller than <CODE>libc6</CODE> aka <CODE>glibc2</CODE> .
</LI>
<LI>Kernel: If your needs are fitted with an older kernel version, you can save some space.
</LI>
<LI>GUI: Avoid as much Graphical User Interface (GUI) as possible.
</LI>
<LI>Tiny Distributions: There are some distributions available which fit from one 3.5&quot; floppy to 10MB disk space and fit for small memories, too. See appendix A and below.
</LI>
<LI>External Storage Devices (Hard Disks, ZIP Drives, NFS, SAMBA): Since many notebooks may be limited in their expandability, using the parallel port is an attractive option. There are external harddisks and ZIP Drives available. Usually they are also connectable via PCMCIA. Another way is using the resources of another machine through NFS or SAMBA etc.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss19.4">19.4 Harddisk Speed</A>
</H2>

<P>Use the tool <CODE>hdparm</CODE> to set up better harddisk performance. Though I have seen laptop disk enabled with <I>striping</I>, I can't see a reason to do so, because IMHO aka RAID0 striping needs at least two different disks to increase performance.
<P>See UNIX and LINUX Computing Journal:

<H3>Techniques</H3>

<P>Check the memory usage with <CODE>free</CODE> and <CODE>top</CODE>.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/mergemem/">Mergemem Project </A>. Many programs contain <I>memory areas of the same content</I> that remain undetected by the operating system. Typically, these areas contain data that have been generated on startup and remain unchanged for longer periods. With <CODE>mergemem</CODE> such areas are detected and shared. The sharing is performed on the operating system level and is invisible to the user level programs. <CODE>mergemem</CODE> is particularily useful if you run many instances of interpreters and emulators (like Java or Prolog) that keep their code in private data areas. But also other programs can take advantage albeit to a lesser degree.
<P>You may also reduce the <I>kernel size</I> as much as possible by removing any feature which is not necessary for your needs and by modularizing the kernel as much as possible.
<P>Also you may shutdown every service or <I>daemon</I> which is not needed, e.g. <CODE>lpd</CODE>, <CODE>mountd</CODE>, <CODE>nfsd</CODE> and close some <I>virtual consoles</I>. Please see Small-Memory-mini-HOWTO for details.
<P>And of coarse use <I>swap space</I>, when possible.
<P>If possible you use the resources of another machine, for instance with X, VNC or even <CODE>telnet</CODE>. For more information on Virtual Network Computing (VNC), see

<LI>If you don't need infrared support, disable it in the BIOS or shutdown the IrDA device driver. There are also some IrDA features of the kernel which are useful for saving power.

<LI>The &quot;noatime&quot; option when mouting filesystems tells the kernel
to <EM>not</EM> update the <I>access time</I> information of the file. This
information, although sometimes useful, is not used by most people (do
you know that <CODE>ls -lu</CODE> gives you the access time?). Therefore,
you can safely disable it, then preventing disk access each time you
<CODE>cat</CODE> a file. Here is an example of a /etc/fstab

<P>Many kernel features are related to laptops. For instance APM, IrDA, PCMCIA and some options for certain laptops, e.g. IBM ThinkPads. In some distributions they not configured. And the kernel is usually bigger than necessary. So it's seems a good idea to customize the kernel. Though this task might seem difficult for the beginner it is highly recommended. Since this involves dangerous operations you need to be careful. But, if you can install a better kernel successfully, you've earned your intermediate Linux sysadmin merit badge. - Since this topic is already covered in other documents I want handle this here.

<LI>BOA - &quot;Lightweight and High Performance WebServer. <CODE>boa</CODE> is a single-tasking HTTP server. That means that unlike traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple connections. It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP connections, and forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate processes.) Preliminary tests show boa is capable of handling several hundred hits per second on a 100 MHz Pentium.&quot;

<A HREF="http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~zvonler/dxpc">http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~zvonler/dxpc</A> is the alternative most people prefer. These systems act as proxy X11 servers and compress datastreams by well over 50 percent for normal requests, often reaching a reduction to 25 percent of the original bandwidth usage.
