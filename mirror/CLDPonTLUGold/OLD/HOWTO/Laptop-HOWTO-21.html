<LI>I found two books about PC hardware which contain a dedicated chapter about repairing laptops.

Title: Upgrading and Repairing PCs

Publisher: QUE Corporation.

Author: Marc Misani

Title: The Complete Hardware Upgrade and Maintainance Guide

Publisher: unknown

Both books don't know about Linux and both are quite short about laptops. The book by Marc Minasi provides a little more information about laptops.

Title: Maintain and Repair Your Notebook, Palmtop, or Pen Computer 

Publisher: McGraw Hill Text, September 1993

Review by Booknews, Inc. , January 1, 1994: A guide to performing routine maintenance and simple repairs to notebook, palmtop and pen computers. Covers such topics as how to diagnose and replace faulty LCD and plasma displays, and how to protect circuitry from electrostatic damage. Written with beginners in mind -- but some hardware experience would be helpful in understanding the subtleties and cautions involved. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or. Though this book seems outdated I don't know a newer one.

Title: The Undocumented PC 

Publisher: Addison Wesley Developers Press

Review by Craig Hart: There are two editions. Edition 1 has a purple cover, edition 2 has a grey marble background photo with brown-on-yellow text panel. Edition 2 is not much better than edition one - only about 10%; of the information has changed, although a lot of typographical errors have been corrected. This is an excellent book, because it not only lists the <I>raw</I> data required to program something, but it has lot's of explanations, how-to's and example programs.
