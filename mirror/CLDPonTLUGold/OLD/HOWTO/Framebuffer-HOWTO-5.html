<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Using framebuffer devices on Intel platforms</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 What is vesafb?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Vesafb is a framebuffer driver for Intel architecture that works with
VESA 2.0 compliant graphic cards. It is closely related to the framebuffer
device drivers in the kernel. 
<P>vesafb is a display driver that enables the use of graphical modes on your
Intel platform for bitmapped text consoles. It can also display a logo,
which is probably the main reason why you'd want to use vesafb :o) 
<P>Unfortunately, you can not use vesafb successfully with VESA 1.2 cards.
This is because these 1.2 cards do not use <EM>linear</EM> frame buffering.
Linear frame buffering simply means that the system's CPU is able to
access every bit of the display. Historically, older graphic adapters
could allow the CPU to access only 64K at a time, hence the limitations of
the dreadful CGA/EGA graphic modes! It may be that someone will write a
vesafb12 device driver for these cards, but this will use up precious
kernel memory and involve a nasty hack.
<P>There is however a potential workaround to add VESA 2.0 extensions for
your legacy VESA 1.2 card. You may be able to download a TSR type program
that will run from DOS, and used in cojunction with loadlin, can help
configure the card for the appropriate graphic console modes. Note that
this will not always work, as an example some Cirrus Logic cards such as
the VLB 54xx series are mapped to a range of memory addresses (for
example, within the 15MB-16MB range) for frame buffering which preludes
these from being used successfully with systems that have more than 32MB
of memory. There is a way to make this work, i.e. if you have a BIOS
option to leave a memory hole at 15MB-16MB range, it might work, Linux
doesn't support the use of memory holes. However there are patches for
this option though [Who has these and where do one gets them from?]. If
you wish to experiment with this option, there are plenty of TSR style
programs available, a prime example is UNIVBE, which can be found on the
Internet.
<P>Alternatively, you may be able to download kernel patches to allow your
VESA 1.2 card to work with the VESA framebuffer driver. For example, 
there are patches for use with older S3 boards (such as S3 Trio, S3 Virge)
that supports VESA 1.2. For these cards, you can pick up patches from

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 How do I activate the vesafb drivers? </A>
</H2>

<P>Assuming you are using menuconfig, you will need to do the following
steps:
<P>If your processor (on Intel platforms) supports MTRRs, enable this. It 
speeds up memory copies between the processor and the graphic card, but
not strictly necessary. You can of course, do this after you have the 
console device working.
<P><EM>IMPORTANT: For 2.1.x kernels, go into the Code Maturity Level menu, 
and enable the prompt for development and</EM><EM>or incomplete drivers. 
This is no longer necessary for the 2.2.x kernels.</EM> 
<P>Go into the Console Drivers menu, and enable the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>VGA Text Console</LI>
<LI>Video Selection Support</LI>
<LI>Support for frame buffer devices (experimental)</LI>
<LI>VESA VGA Graphic console</LI>
<LI>Advanced Low Level Drivers</LI>
<LI>Select Mono, 2bpp, 4bpp, 8bpp, 16bpp, 24bpp and 32bpp packed pixel
drivers</LI>
</UL>
<P>VGA Chipset Support (text only) - vgafb - used to be part of the list
above, but it has been removed as it is now deprecated and no longer
supported. It will be removed shortly. Use VGA Text Console (fbcon)
instead. VGA Character/Attributes is only used with VGA Chipset
Support, and doesn't need to be selected.
<P>Ensure that the Mac variable bpp packed pixel support is not enabled.
Linux kernel release 2.1.111 (and 112) seemed to enable this
automatically if Advanced Low Level Drivers was selected for the first
time. This no longer happens with 2.1.113. 
<P>There is also the option to compile in fonts into memory, but this isn't
really necessary, and you can always use kbd-0.99's (see section on fonts)
setfont utility to change fonts by loading fonts into the console device. 
<P>Make sure these aren't going to be modules. [Not sure if it's possible to
build them as modules yet - please correct me on this]
<P>You'll need to create the framebuffer device in /dev. You need one per
framebuffer device, so all you need to do is to type in mknod /dev/fb0 c 29 0
for the first one. Subsequent ones would be in multiples of 32, so for example
to create /dev/fb1, you would need to type in mknod /dev/fb1 c 29 32, and so on
up to the eighth framebuffer device (mknod /dev/fb7 c 29 224)
<P>Then rebuild the kernel, modify /etc/lilo.conf to include the VGA=ASK
parameter, and run lilo, this is required in order for you to be able to
select the modes you wish to use.
<P>Here's a sample LILO configuration (taken from my machine)
<P>
<PRE>
# LILO configuration file
boot = /dev/hda3
delay = 30 
prompt
vga = ASK # Let user enter the desired modes
image = /vmlinuz
  root = /dev/hda3
  label = Linux
  read-only # Non-UMSDOS filesystems should be mounted read-only for checking
</PRE>
<P>Reboot the kernel, and as a simple test, try entering 0301 at the VGA
prompt (this will give you 640x480 @ 256), and you should be able to see a
cute little Penguin logo.
<P>Note, that at the VGA prompt, you're required to type in the number in 
the format of "0" plus the 3 digit figure, and miss out the 'x'. This isn't
necessary if you're using LILO.
<P>Once you can see that's working well, you can explore the various VESA
modes (see below) and decide on the one that you like the best, and
hardwire that into the "VGA=x" parameter in lilo.conf. When you have
chosen the one you like the best, look up the equivalent hexadecimal number
from the table below and use that (i.e. for 1280x1024 @ 256, you just use 
"VGA=0x307"), and re-run lilo. That's all there it is to it. 
For further references, read the LoadLin/LILO HOWTOs.
<P><EM>NOTE!</EM> vesafb does not enable scrollback buffering as a default. You
will need to pass to the kernel the option to enable it. Use
video=vesa:ypan or video=vesa:ywrap to activate it. Both does the same
thing, but in different ways. ywrap is a lot faster than ypan but may not
work on slightly broken VESA 2.0 graphic cards. ypan is slower than ywrap
but a lot more compatible. This option is only present in kernel 2.1.116
and above. Earlier kernels did not have the ability to allow scrollback
buffering in vesafb.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 What VESA modes are available to me? </A>
</H2>

<P>This really depends on the type of VESA 2.0 compliant graphic card that
you have in your system, and the amount of video memory available. This is
just a matter of testing which modes work best for your graphic card.
<P>The following table shows the mode numbers you can input at the VGA prompt
or for use with the LILO program. (actually these numbers are plus 0x200
to make it easier to refer to the table)
<P>
<PRE>
Colours   640x400 640x480 800x600 1024x768 1152x864 1280x1024 1600x1200

32 bits |    ?       ?       ?        ?      0x164      ?
</PRE>
<P>Key: 8 bits = 256 colours, 15 bits = 32,768 colours, 16 bits = 65,536
colours, 24 bits = 16.8 million colours, 32 bits - same as 24 bits, but
the extra 8 bits can be used for other things, and fits perfectly with a
32 bit PCI/VLB/EISA bus.
<P>Additional modes are at the discretion of the manufacturer, as the VESA
2.0 document only defines modes up to 0x31F. You may need to do some
fiddling around to find these extra modes.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Got a Matrox card?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If you've got a Matrox graphic card, you don't actually need vesafb, you 
need the matroxfb driver instead. This greatly enhances the capabilities
of your card. Matroxfb will work with Matrox Mystique Millennium I &amp; II, 
G100 and G200. It also supports multiheaded systems (that is, if you have
two Matrox cards in your machine, you can use two displays on the same 
machine!). To configure for Matrox, you will need to do the following:
<P>You might want to upgrade the Matrox BIOS though, you can download the BIOS
upgrade from 
<PRE>
http://www.matrox.com/mgaweb/drivers/ftp_bios.htm
</PRE>
 Beware that
you will need DOS to do this. 
<P>Go into the Code Maturity Level menu, and enable the prompt for
development and/or incomplete drivers [note this may change for future
kernels - when this happens, this HOWTO will be revised]
<P>Go into the Console Drivers menu, and enable the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>VGA Text Console</LI>
<LI>Video Selection Support</LI>
<LI>Support for frame buffer devices (experimental)</LI>
<LI>Matrox Acceleration</LI>

<LI>Advanced Low Level Drivers</LI>
<LI>Select Mono, 2bpp, 4bpp, 8bpp, 16bpp, 24bpp and 32bpp packed pixel
drivers</LI>
</UL>
<P>Rebuild your kernel. Then you will need to modify your lilo.conf file to 
enable the Matroxfb device. The quickest and simplest way is re-use mine.

<P> 
<P>As far as is known, vesafb can't be modularised, although at some point
in time, the developer of vesafb may decide to modify the sources for
modularising. Note that even if modularising is possible, at boot time
you will not be able to see any output on the display until vesafb is
<EM>modprobed</EM>. It's probably a lot wiser to leave it in the kernel, for
these cases when there are booting problems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.9">5.9 How do I modify the cursor?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>[Taken from VGA-softcursor.txt - thanks Martin Mares!]
<P>Linux now has some ability to manipulate cursor appearance. Normally,
you can set the size of hardware cursor (and also work around some ugly
bugs in those miserable Trident cards--see #define TRIDENT_GLITCH in
drivers/char/ vga.c). In case you enable "Software generated cursor" in
the system configuration, you can play a few new tricks:  you can make
your cursor look like a non-blinking red block, make it inverse
background of the character it's over or to highlight that character and
still choose whether the original hardware cursor should remain visible
or not.  There may be other things I have never thought of.
<P>The cursor appearance is controlled by a 
<PRE>
&lt;ESC>[?1;2;3c
</PRE>
 escape
sequence where 1, 2 and 3 are parameters described below. If you omit any
of them, they will default to zeroes.
<P>Parameter 1 specifies cursor size (0=default, 1=invisible, 2=underline,
..., 8=full block) + 16 if you want the software cursor to be applied + 32
if you want to always change the background colour + 64 if you dislike
having the background the same as the foreground.  Highlights are ignored
for the last two flags.
<P>The second parameter selects character attribute bits you want to change
(by simply XORing them with the value of this parameter). On standard VGA,
the high four bits specify background and the low four the foreground. In
both groups, low three bits set colour (as in normal colour codes used by
the console) and the most significant one turns on highlight (or sometimes
blinking--it depends on the configuration of your VGA).
<P>The third parameter consists of character attribute bits you want to set.
Bit setting takes place before bit toggling, so you can simply clear a bit
by including it in both the set mask and the toggle mask.
<P>To get normal blinking underline, use: echo -e '\033[?2c'
To get blinking block, use:            echo -e '\033[?6c'
To get red non-blinking block, use:    echo -e '\033[?17;0;64c'
