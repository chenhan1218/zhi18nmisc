<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 NFS booting fails.</A>
</H2>

<P>Usually, the reason for this is that people have unpacked the tar archive
under IRIX, not Linux.  Since the representation of device files over
NFS is not standardized between various Unices, this fails.  The symptom
is that the system dies with the error message ``Warning: unable to open
an initial console.'' right after mounting the NFS filesystem.
<P>
<P>For now, the workaround is to use a Linux system (doesn't need to be MIPS)
to unpack the installation archive onto the NFS server.  The NFS server
itself may be any type of UNIX.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Self-compiled kernels crash when booting.</A>
</H2>

<P>When I build my own kernel, it crashes.  On an Indy the crash message
looks like the following (the same problem hits other machines as well
but may look completely different):

   PANIC: Unexpected exception
  
</PRE>
<P>This problem is caused by a still unfixed bug in Binutils newer than
version 2.7.  As a workaround, change the following line in arch/mips/Makefile
from:
<P>
<PRE>
   LINKFLAGS       = -static -N
 
</PRE>
<P>to:
<P>
<PRE>
   LINKFLAGS       = -static

</PRE>
<P>This problem only happens for Indys with very old PROM versions which cannot
handle the ELF binary format which Linux uses.  A solution for this problem
is in the works.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Where can I get the little endian firmware for my SNI?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>SNI's system can be operated in both big and little endian modes.  At this
time, Linux/MIPS only supports the little endian firmware.  This is somewhat
unlucky since SNI hasn't shipped that firmware for quite some time, since
they dropped Windows&nbsp;NT.
<P>When running in big endian mode, the firmware looks
similar to an SGI Indy which is already supported, therefore fixing the
SNI support will be relatively easy.  Interested hackers should contact
<A HREF="mailto:ralf@gnu.org">Ralf B&auml;chle (ralf@gnu.org)</A>.

</H2>

<P>
<PRE>
   collect2: ld terminated with signal 6 [Aborted]
 
</PRE>

This is a known bug in older binutils versions.  You will have to upgrade to
binutils 2.8.1 plus very current patches.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 My machine doesn't download the kernel when I try to netboot</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Your machine is replying to the BOOTP packets (you may verify this
using a packet sniffer like tcpdump or ethereal), but doesn't download the
kernel from your BOOTP server. This happens if your boot server is 
running a kernel of the 2.3 series or higher. The problem may be circumvented
by doing a "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc" as root on your
boot server.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 Bug in DHCP version 2</A>
</H2>

<P>When using DHCP version 2 you might see the following problem:
Your machines receives it's BOOTP reply 3 times but refuses to start TFTP.
You can fix this by doing a "unsetenv netaddr" in the PROM command monitor before you boot your
system. DHCP version 3 fixes that problem.
