For unclear reasons this brand new release is codenamed
the <B>Taylor2</B> release.
<P>New code names will appear as per industry standard guidelines
to emphasize the state-of-the-art-ness of this document.
<P>
<P>This document was written for two reasons, mainly because I got hold
of 3 old SCSI disks to set up my Linux system on and I was pondering
how best to utilise the inherent possibilities of parallelizing in a
SCSI system. Secondly I hear there is a prize for people who write
documents...
<P>This is intended to be read in conjunction with the Linux Filesystem
Structure Standard (FSSTND). It does not in any way replace it but tries to
suggest where physically to place directories detailed in the FSSTND,
in terms of drives, partitions, types, RAID, file system (fs),
physical sizes and other parameters that should be considered and
tuned in a Linux system, ranging from single home systems to large
servers on the Internet.
<P>
<P>The followup to FSSTND is called the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
and covers more than Linux alone. FHS versions 2.0 and 2.1 have been
released but there are still a few issues to be dealt with and even
longer before this new standard will have an impact on actual
distributions. FHS is not yet used in any distributions but Debian
has announced they will use it in Debian 2.1 which is their next
distribution.
<P>It is also a good idea to read the Linux Installation guides thoroughly
and if you are using a PC system, which I guess the majority still does,
you can find much relevant and useful information in the FAQs for the
newsgroup comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware especially for storage media.
<P>This is also a learning experience for myself and I hope I can start
the ball rolling with this HOWTO and that it perhaps can evolve
into a larger more detailed and hopefully even more correct HOWTO.
<P>
<P>First of all we need a bit of legalese. Recent development shows it is
quite important.

</H2>

<P>
<!--

<P>
<P>This release features a major restructuring and more additions
than I can list here especially on 
backup systems, hints and tips and even more on file system support.
Also there is now a new appendix with a shell script that helps
you characterise your system which is useful for debugging,
especially when asking others for help.
Also a section on troubleshooting has been added
as well as a subsection on mount options.
<P>This HOWTO now uses indexing and is based on SGMLtools version 1.0.5
and the old version will therefore not format this document properly.
<P>Also quite new is a number of new translations available.
Now a Chinese and also an Italian translation are under way.
<P>On the development front people are concentrating their energy towards
completing Linux 2.2 and until that is released there is not going to
be much news on disk technology for Linux.
<P>
<P>Also now the document is available in postscript
both for US letter as well as European A4 formats.
<P>The latest version number of this document can be gleaned from my
plan entry if you
