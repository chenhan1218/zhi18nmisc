<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA or
``PC Card'' support package.  It includes a set of loadable
kernel modules that 
implement a version of the Card Services applications program interface,
a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card manager daemon
that can respond to card insertion and removal events, loading and
unloading drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping'' of most
card types, so cards can be safely inserted and ejected at any time.
<P>This software is continually under development.  It probably contains
bugs, and should be used with caution.  I'll do my best to fix
problems that are reported to me, but if you don't tell me, I may
never know.  If you use this code, I hope you will send me your
experiences, good or bad!
<P>If you have any suggestions for how this document could be improved,
please let me know (<CODE>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What is the latest version, and where can I get it?</A>
</H2>

<P>The current major release of Card Services is version 3.1, and minor
updates or bug fixes are numbered 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and so on.
<P>Source code for the latest version is available by FTP at
<CODE>projects.sourceforge.net</CODE> in the <CODE>/pub/pcmcia-cs</CODE>
directory, as <CODE>pcmcia-cs-3.1.?.tar.gz</CODE>.  There will usually be
several versions here.  I generally only keep the latest minor release
for a given major release.  New major releases may contain relatively
untested code, so I also keep the latest version of the previous major
release as a relatively stable fallback; the current fallback is
3.0.14.  It is up to you to decide which version is more appropriate,
but the <CODE>CHANGES</CODE> file will summarize the most important
differences.
<P>The Linux PCMCIA FTP site is mirrored at <CODE>sunsite.unc.edu</CODE>
(and all sunsite mirror sites) in <CODE>/pub/Linux/kernel/pcmcia</CODE>.
<P>If you do not feel up to compiling the drivers from scratch,
pre-compiled drivers are included with current releases of most of the
major Linux distributions, including Slackware, Debian, Red Hat,
Caldera, SuSE, and Yggdrasil, among others.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 What systems are supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>This package should run on almost Intel-based Linux-capable laptop.
It also runs on Alpha-based platforms (i.e., the DEC Multia).  Work is
being done to make the package fully dual-endian, so that it will also
support PowerPC-based platforms (i.e., Apple Powerbooks).  Most 
common socket controllers are supported.  Card docks for
desktop systems should work as long as they use a supported
controller, and are plugged directly into the ISA or PCI bus, as
opposed to SCSI-to-PCMCIA or IDE-to-PCMCIA adapters.  The following
controllers are recognized by the supplied socket drivers:

</UL>
<P>Other controllers that are register compatible with the Intel i82365sl
will generally work, as well.
<P>Support for 32-bit CardBus cards is still somewhat experimental.
Drivers prior to version 3.0 only support 16-bit cards in CardBus
sockets.  Due to the rapid pace of technological change for laptop
hardware, new controllers appear frequently, and there may be delays
between when a new model appears on the market, and when driver
support becomes available.
<P>Toshiba has made available some documentation for their ToPIC95 and
ToPIC97 chipsets, however the information they have provided has not
really been adequate.  Despite conflicting reports to the contrary,
Toshiba has not made any effective effort to remedy this situation.
There are serious bugs in Linux support for the ToPIC chipsets, that
cannot be resolved until better documentation or help from Toshiba
becomes available.  I do not recommend use of Toshiba laptops at this
time.  For use of 16-bit cards, I recommend setting the bridge mode to
``PCIC'' in the BIOS setup; for CardBus cards, you are on your own.
<P>The Motorola 6AHC05GA controller used in some Hyundai laptops is not
supported.  The custom host controller in the HP Omnibook 600 is
also unsupported.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 What cards are supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>The current release includes drivers for a variety of ethernet cards,
a driver for modem and serial port cards, several SCSI adapter
drivers, a driver for ATA/IDE drive cards, and memory card drivers
that should support most SRAM cards and some flash cards.  The
<CODE>SUPPORTED.CARDS</CODE> file included with each release of Card Services
lists all cards that are known to work in at least one actual system.
<P>The likelihood that a card not on the supported list will work depends
on the type of card.  Essentially all modems should work with the
supplied driver.  Some network cards may work if they are OEM versions
of supported cards.  Other types of IO cards (frame buffers,
sound cards, etc) will not work until someone writes the appropriate
drivers.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 When will my favorite (unsupported) card become supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>Unfortunately, they usually don't pay me to write device drivers, so
if you would like to have a driver for your favorite card, you are
probably going to have to do at least some of the work.  Ideally, I'd
like to work towards a model like the Linux kernel, where I would be
responsible mainly for the ``core'' driver code and other authors
would contribute and maintain client drivers for specific cards.  The
<CODE>SUPPORTED.CARDS</CODE> file mentions some cards for which driver work is
currently in progress.  I will try to help where I can, but be warned
that debugging kernel device drivers by email is not particularly
effective.  
<P>Manufacturers interested in helping provide Linux support for their
products can contact me about consulting arrangements.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 Mailing lists and other information sources</A>
</H2>

<P>I used to maintain a database and mailing list of Linux PCMCIA users.
More recently, I've turned my web page for Linux PCMCIA information
into a ``HyperNews'' site, with a set of message lists for Linux
PCMCIA issues.  There are lists for installation and configuration
issues, for different types of cards, and for programming and
debugging issues.  The Linux PCMCIA information page is at
<A HREF="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net">http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net</A>.
Users can request email notification of new responses to particular
questions, or notification for all new messages in a given category.
I hope that this will become a useful repository of information, for
questions that go beyond the scope of the HOWTO.
<P>There is a Linux mailing list devoted to laptop issues, the
``linux-laptop'' list.  For more information, send a message
containing the word ``help'' to <CODE>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</CODE>.  To
subscribe, send a message containing ``subscribe linux-laptop'' to the
same address.  This mailing list might be a good forum for discussion
of Linux PCMCIA issues.
<P>The Linux Laptop Home Page at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop</A> has links
to many sites that have information about configuring specific types
of laptops for Linux.  There is also a searchable database of system
configuration information.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.8">1.8 Why don't you distribute binaries?</A>
</H2>

<P>For me, distributing binaries would be a significant hassle.  It is
complicated because some features can only be selected at compile
time, and because the modules are somewhat dependent on having
the ``right'' kernel configuration.  So, I would probably need to
distribute precompiled modules along with matching kernels.  Beyond
this, the greatest need for precompiled modules is when installing
Linux on a clean system.  This typically requires setting up drivers so
they can be used in the installation process for a particular Linux
distribution.  Each Linux distribution has its own ideosyncracies, and
it is not feasible for me to provide boot and root disks for even just
the common combinations of drivers and distributions.
<P>PCMCIA is now a part of many of the major Linux distributions,
including Red Hat, Caldera, Slackware, Yggdrasil, Craftworks, and
Nascent Technology.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.9">1.9 Why is the package so darned big?</A>
</H2>

<P>Well, first of all, it isn't actually that large.  All the driver
modules together take up about 500K of disk space.  The utility
programs add up to about 70K, and the scripts in <CODE>/etc/pcmcia</CODE>
are about 50K.  The core driver modules take up about 55K of system
memory.  The <CODE>cardmgr</CODE> daemon will generally be swapped out except
when cards are inserted or removed.  The total package size is
comparable to DOS/Windows Card Services implementations.
<P>Compared to DOS ``point enablers'', this may still seem like a lot of
overhead, especially for people that don't plan on using many of the
features of PCMCIA, such as power management or hot swapping.  Point
enablers can be tiny because they generally support only one or a
small set of cards, and also generally support a restricted set of
host controllers.  If someone were to write a genuinely ``generic''
modem enabler, it would end up incorporating much of the functionality
of Card Services, to handle cards from different vendors and the full
range of host controller variants.
