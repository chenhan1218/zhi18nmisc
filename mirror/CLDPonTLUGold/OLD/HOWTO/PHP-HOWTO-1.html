<P><I><B>Definition:</B> PHP is a simple, object-oriented,
interpreted, robust, secure, very high-performance, architecture neutral, portable,
dynamic scripting language. Everything inside "class"
keyword in PHP will be identical to Java language (in near future). And PHP is
designed such that it is 10 times faster than Java, since there is no virtual machine.
PHP is the international standard general purpose object oriented scripting language.</I>
<P>PHP stands for 'Hypertext Pre-Processor' and is a server 
side HTML scripting/programming language.
PHP is a tool that lets you create dynamic web pages. PHP-enabled web pages
are treated just like regular HTML pages and you can create and edit them
the same way you normally create regular HTML pages.
<P>PHP was kept the <B>"top secret and strictly confidential"</B> 
computer language by many companies in the world, but now had become 
the most well-known and most widely used object oriented scripting language for 
web, internet, e-commerce and business-to-business projects. 
Even today many competing companies keep PHP language as a 
highly confidential matter not disclosing to outsiders (competitors).
<P>PHP will storm the entire world and will take the IT industry by surprise!!
The power of PHP is that it is <B>cross-platform and runs everywhere!!</B>
It runs on Linux, Windows 95/98/NT, Windows 2000, Solaris, HPUX and all
flavors of unix.  PHP is write once and deploy anywhere and everywhere.
It runs on many web-servers like Apache, Microsoft IIS, etc..
<P>PHP runs 5 to 20 times faster than Java!! In actual benchmarks, PHP was
3.7 times faster than JSP (see 
<A HREF="PHP-HOWTO-10.html#benchmarks">benchmarks</A>
). PHP is extremely easy to use 
and you can develop very complex web/e-commerce applications 
very rapidly in a very short period of time. 
(In future PHP language will imitate most features of Java language and
Java programmers will <B>love</B> PHP. And PHP will have java keywords 
like class, extends, interface, implements, public, protected, private etc..).
<P>It has object oriented features and takes the best features from Java,
C++, PERL and "C" languages. PHP language is a <I>marriage</I> of
best features from Java, C++, PERL and C.
<P>PHP is the <B>real gem</B> of all the scripting/programming languges 
and will soon become the "MECCA" for programmers world-wide!! 
PHP has a huge user base and a large 
developer base as it runs on both Window95/NT/2000 and all flavors of unixes.
<P>PHP can be compiled and optimized to make it run even faster by using the
Zend Optimizer. Zend optimizer is integrated with PHP in PHP version 4.0.
<P>You would normally use a combination of 
PHP (70% code) + HTML/DHTML/XML (25% code) + Javascript (5% code client side validations) 
for your e-commerce projects.
