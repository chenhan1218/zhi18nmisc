<P><B>A first stab at DNS config, very useful for dialup, cable-modem
and ADSL users.</B>
<P>
<P>On Red Hat and Red Hat related distributions you can achieve the
same practical result as this HOWTO's first section by installing the
packages <CODE>bind</CODE>, <CODE>bind-utils</CODE> and caching-nameserver.  If you
use Debian simply install <CODE>bind</CODE> and <CODE>bind-doc</CODE>.  Of course just
installing those packages won't teach you as much as reading this
HOWTO.  So install the packages, and then read along verifying the
files they installed.
<P>
<P>A caching only name server will find the answer to name queries and
remember the answer the next time you need it.  This will shorten the
waiting time the next time significantly, especially if you're on a
slow connection.
<P>
<P>First you need a file called <CODE>/etc/named.conf</CODE> (Debian:
<CODE>/etc/bind/named.conf</CODE>).  This is read when named starts.  For
now it should simply contain:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
// Config file for caching only name server

options {
        directory "/var/named";

        // Uncommenting this might help if you have to go through a
        // firewall and things are not working out.  But you probably
        // need to talk to your firewall admin.

        // query-source port 53;
};

zone "." {
        type hint;
        file "root.hints";
};

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        file "pz/127.0.0";
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The Linux distribution packages may use different file names for
each kind of file mentioned here; they will still contain about the
same things.
<P>
<P>The `<CODE>directory</CODE>' line tells named where to look for files.  All
files named subsequently will be relative to this.  Thus <CODE>pz</CODE>
is a directory under <CODE>/var/named</CODE>, i.e.,
<CODE>/var/named/pz</CODE>.  <CODE>/var/named</CODE> is the right directory
according to the <EM>Linux File system Standard</EM>.
<P>
<P>The file named <CODE>/var/named/root.hints</CODE> is named in this.
<CODE>/var/named/root.hints</CODE> should contain this: (<EM>If you cut
and paste this file from an electronic version of this document,
please note that there should be <B>no</B> leading spaces in the file,
i.e. all the lines should start with a non-blank character.  Some
document processing software will insert spaces at beginning of the
lines, causing some confusion.  In that case please remove the leading
spaces</EM>)

<HR>
<P>
<P>Next, you need a <CODE>/etc/resolv.conf</CODE> looking something like
this: (<EM>Again: Remove spaces!</EM>)
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
search subdomain.your-domain.edu your-domain.edu
nameserver 127.0.0.1
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The `<CODE>search</CODE>' line specifies what domains should be searched
for any host names you want to connect to.  The `<CODE>nameserver</CODE>' line
specifies the address of your nameserver, in this case your own
machine since that is where your named runs (127.0.0.1 is right, no
matter if your machine has another address too).  If you want to list
several name servers put in one `<CODE>nameserver</CODE>' line for
each. (Note: Named never reads this file, the resolver that uses named
does. Note 2: In some resolv.conf files you find a line saying
"domain".  That's fine, but don't use both "search" and "domain", only
one of them will work).
<P>
<P>To illustrate what this file does: If a client tries to look up
<CODE>foo</CODE>, then <CODE>foo.subdomain.your-domain.edu</CODE> is tried
first, then <CODE>foo.your-domain.edu</CODE>, and finally <CODE>foo</CODE>.
You may not want to put in too many domains in the search line, as it
takes time to search them all.
<P>
<P>The example assumes you belong in the domain
<CODE>subdomain.your-domain.edu</CODE>; your machine, then, is probably
called <CODE>your-machine.subdomain.your-domain.edu</CODE>.  The search
line should not contain your TLD (Top Level Domain, `<CODE>edu</CODE>' in this
case).  If you frequently need to connect to hosts in another domain
you can add that domain to the search line like this: (<EM>Remember to
remove the leading spaces, if any</EM>)
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
search subdomain.your-domain.edu your-domain.edu other-domain.com
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>and so on. Obviously you need to put real domain names in instead.
Please note the lack of periods at the end of the domain names.  This
is important; please note the lack of periods at the end of the domain
names.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="starting"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Starting named</A>
</H2>

<P>After all this it's time to start named.  If you're using a dialup
connection connect first.  Type `<CODE>ndc start</CODE>', and press return, no
options.  If that does not work try `<CODE>/usr/sbin/ndc start</CODE>'
instead.  If that back-fires see the 
<A HREF="DNS-HOWTO-10.html#qanda">qanda</A>
section.  If you view your syslog message file (usually called
<CODE>/var/adm/messages</CODE>, but another directory to look in is
<CODE>/var/log</CODE> and another file to look in is <CODE>syslog</CODE>) while
starting named (do <CODE>tail -f /var/log/messages</CODE>) you should see
something like:

<P>If there are any messages about errors then there is a mistake.
Named will name the file it is in.  Go back and check the file.  Run
"ndc restart" when you have fixed it.
<P>
<P>Now you can test your setup.  Traditionally a program called
<CODE>nslookup</CODE> is used for this.  These days <CODE>dig</CODE> is recommended:

<P>
<P>This time dig asked your named to look for the machine
<CODE>pat.uio.no</CODE>.  It then contacted one of the name server machines
named in your <CODE>root.hints</CODE> file, and asked its way from there.
It might take tiny while before you get the result as it may need to
search all the domains you named in <CODE>/etc/resolv.conf</CODE>.  Please
note the "aa" on the "flags:" line.  It means that the answer is
authoritative, that it is fresh from an authoritative server.  I'll
explain "authoritative" later.

<P>
<P>Note the lack of a "aa" flag in this answer. That means that named
did not go out on the network to ask this time, as the information is
in the cache now.  But the cached information <EM>might</EM> be out of
date (stale).  So you are informed of this (very slight) possibility
by the "aa" not being there.  But, now you know that your cache is
working.

<P>All OSes implementing the standard C API has the calls
gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.  These can get information from
several different sources.  Which sources it gets it from is
configured in <CODE>/etc/nsswitch.conf</CODE> on Linux (and some other
Unixes).  This is a long file specifying from which file or database
to get different kinds of data types.  It usually contains helpful
comments at the top, which you should consider reading.  After that
find the line starting with `<CODE>hosts:</CODE>'; it should read:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
hosts:      files dns

<P>(<EM>You remembered about the leading spaces, right? I won't mention
them again.</EM>)
<P>
<P>If there is no line starting with `<CODE>hosts:</CODE>' then put in the one

<CODE>resolv.conf</CODE>.
