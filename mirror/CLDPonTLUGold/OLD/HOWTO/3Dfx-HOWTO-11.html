<H2><A NAME="s11">11. FAQ: Troubleshooting?</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 Has this hardware been tested?</A>
</H2>

<P>See hardware requirements list above. I currently do not
maintain a conclusive list of vendors and boards, as no
particular board specific problems have been verified.
Currently, only 3Dfx and Quantum3D provide boards
for testing to the developers, so Quantum3D consumer
boards are a safe bet. Every other Voodoo Graphics (tm) based board
should work, too. I have reports regarding the
Orchid Righteous 3D, Guillemot Maxi 3D Gamer, and 
Diamond Monster 3D. 
<P>If you are a board manufacturer who wants to make
sure his Voodoo Graphics (tm), Voodoo Rush (tm) or Voodoo 2 (tm) boards work
with upcoming releases of Linux, Xfree86, Linux Glide
and/or Mesa, please contact me, and I will happily forward
your request to the persons maintaining the drivers in
question. If you are interested in support for Linux Glide
on other then the PC platfrom, e.g. DEC Alpha, please
contact the maintainer of Linux Glide Daryll Strauss, at
<A HREF="mailto:daryll@harlot.rb.ca.us">daryll@harlot.rb.ca.us</A><P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Failed to change I/O privilege?</A>
</H2>

<P>You need to be root, or <CODE>setuid</CODE> your
application to run a Glide based application.
For DMA, the driver accesses <CODE>/dev/mem</CODE>,
which is not writeable for anybody but root,
with good reasons. See the README in the
Glide distribution for Linux.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.3">11.3 Does it work without root privilege?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are compelling case where the setuid requirement is a
problem, obviously. There are currently solutions in
preparation, which require changes to the library internals
itself. 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4 Displayed images looks awful (single screen)?</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are using the analog pass through configuration,
the common SVGA or X11 display might look pretty bad.
You could try to get a better connector cable than
the one provided with the accelerator board (the
ones delivered with the Diamond Monster 3D are
reportedly worse then the one accompanying the
Orchid Righteous 3D), but up to a degree there will
inevitably be signal loss with an additional
transmission added.
<P>If the 640x480 full screen image created by the
accelerator board does look awful, this might indicate
a real hardware problem. You will have to contact
the board manufacturer, not 3Dfx for details, as
the quality of the video signal has nothing to do
with the accelerator - the board manufacturer chooses
the RAMDAC, output drivers, and other components
responsible.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 The last frame is still there (single or dual screen)?</A>
</H2>

<P>You terminated your application with Ctrl-C, or it
did not exit normally. The accelerator board will
dutifully provide the current content of the
framebuffer as a video signal unless told otherwise.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6 Powersave kicks in (dual screen)?</A>
</H2>

<P>When you application terminates in dual screen setups,
the accelerator board does not provide video output
any longer. Thus powersave kicks each time. To avoid
this, use
<HR>
<PRE>
setenv SST_DUALSCREEN 1
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.7">11.7 My machine seem to lock (X11, single screen)?</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are running X when calling a Glide
application, you probably moved the mouse out
of the window, and the keyboard inputs do
not reach the application anymore.
<P>If you application is supposed to run concurrently
with X11, it is recommend to expose a full screen
window, or use the <CODE>XGrabPointer</CODE> and 
<CODE>XGrabServer</CODE>
functions to redirect all inputs to the application
while the X server cannot access the display. Note
that grabbing all input with <CODE>XGrabPointer</CODE> and
<CODE>XGrabServer</CODE> does not qualify as well-behaved
application, and that your program might block the
entire system.
<P>If you experience this problem without running X,
be sure that there is no hardware conflict (see below).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.8">11.8 My machine locks (single or dual screen)?</A>
</H2>

<P>If the system definitely does not respond to any inputs
(you are running two displays and know about the loss
of focus), you might experience a more or less
subtle hardware conflict.
See installation troubleshooting section for details.
<P>If there is no obvious address conflict, there might
still be other problems (below). If you are writing your
own code the most common reason for locking is that you
didn't snap your vertices. See the section on snapping
in the Glide documentation.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.9">11.9 My machine locks (used with S3 VGA board)?</A>
</H2>

<P>It is possible you have a problem with memory
region overlap specific to S3. There is some
info and a patch to the so-called S3 problem
in the 3Dfx web site, but these apply to Windows
only. To my understanding, the cause of the problem
is that some S3 boards (older revisions of Diamond 
Stealth S3 968) reserve more memory space than
actually used, thus the Voodoo Graphics (tm) has to be mapped
to a different location. However, this has not
been reported as a problem with Linux, and might
be Windows-specific.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.10">11.10 No address conflict, but locks anyway?</A>
</H2>

<P>If you happen to use a motherboard with non-standard
or incomplete PCI support, you could try to 
shuffle the boards a bit. I am running an ASUS
TP4XE that has that non-standard modified "Media Slot",
i.e. PCI slot4 with additional connector for
ASUS-manufactured SCSI/Sound combo boards,
and I experienced severe problems while running a
Diamond Monster 3D in that slot. The system operates
flawlessly since I put the board in one of the 
regular slots.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.11">11.11 Mesa runs, but does not access the board?</A>
</H2>

<P>Be sure that you recompiled all the libraries (including
the toolkits the demo programs use - remember that
GLUT does not yet support Voodoo Graphics (tm)), and that you
removed the older libraries, run <CODE>ldconfig</CODE>,
and/or set your <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> properly.
Mesa supports several drivers in parallel (you could
use X11 SHM, off screen rendering, and Mesa Voodoo at
the same time), and you might have to create and
switch contexts explicitely (see <CODE>MakeCurrent</CODE>
function) if the Voodoo Graphics (tm) isn't chosen by default.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.12">11.12 Resetting dual board SLI?</A>
</H2>

<P>If a Quantum 3D Obsidian board using in an SLI setup
exits abruptly (i.e., the application crashes, or is
aborted by user), the boards are left in an undefined
state.  With the dual-board set, you can run a 
program called <CODE>resetsli</CODE> to reset them. Until
you run the <CODE>resetsli</CODE> program, you will not
be able to re-initialize the Obsidian board.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.13">11.13 Resetting single board SLI?</A>
</H2>

<P>The <CODE>resetsli</CODE> program mentioned above does not
yet work with a single board Obsidian SLI (e.g. the
Obsidian 100-4440SB). You will have to reboot your
system by reset in order to reset the board.
