<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Stage 2. Terminal to remote UNIX system</A></H2>

<P> 
<P>Arrange for what is called a "shell account" on some Unix
system.  Most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can provide this
service.  Use the terminal emulator program and a modem to
dial in.  Learn the basic Unix commands.  If the system has Emacs
installed, or you can persuade the system administrator to install it,
this is your second chance to learn it.  It is probably best to learn
it at this point, because administering a Unix system (the next stage)
will call for you to edit files.  Therefore, I include here my
suggestions for learning both Unix and Emacs.
<P>

</H2>

<P>When you arrange for a shell account, or set up a new account on your
own machine, you will have to decide on a username and a password.
Your username will also be used in your email address, so try to find
something short and memorable.  Your password is important, and should
be hard to guess.  That usually means at least six characters,
including at least one non-alphanumeric character.
<P>When a Unix system is ready for you to log in, it normally
displays a prompt ending with "login:".  At this point you should type
in your username.  It will then prompt you for your password, and will
turn off command echoing while you type it in.
<P>The command to finish a terminal session is <CODE>logout</CODE>.  
<P>There are many kinds of documentation available on a Linux system.
Traditionally, each command has a manual page which can be
displayed by the  <CODE>man</CODE> command.  For example, learn more about
the <CODE>cp</CODE> command by typing <CODE>man cp</CODE>.  Of course, this helps only if
you know or can guess the command name.  However, each man page has a
line near the beginning with the command name and a
short description of what the command does.  You can search a database
of these lines using the command <CODE>apropos</CODE>.  Thus, typing <CODE>apropos
working</CODE> will list lines that include the word "working".  Here's what
that command prints here:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd (n)               - Change working directory
pwd (n)              - Return the current working directory
Cwd (3pm)            - get pathname of current working directory
chdir (2)            - change working directory
fchdir (2)           - change working directory
get_current_dir_name (3) - Get current working directory
getcwd (3)           - Get current working directory
getwd (3)            - Get current working directory
pwd (1)              - print name of current/working directory
rcsclean (1)         - clean up working files
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The numbers in parentheses are sections of the manual.  User commands
are in section 1.  Functions called from within programs are in
sections 2 and 3.  Commands used mostly by the system administrator
are in section 8.  You can find out more about the on-line manual with
the command <CODE>man man</CODE>.
<P>The program that interprets your command is a "shell".  Under DOS,
COMMAND.COM is the shell.  Most Unix shells are descendents of either
the Bourne shell <CODE>sh</CODE> or the C shell <CODE>csh</CODE>.  The shell most
commonly used with Linux is the "Bourne again shell", or <CODE>bash</CODE>.
Many Unix commands that were once separate programs are built into
bash.  Help for these is also built in.  For example, typing <CODE>help
cd</CODE> will display a short description of the <CODE>cd</CODE> command.  Typing
<CODE>help</CODE> by itself will display a list of all the builtin commands.
Unfortunately, it is shown in two columns.  If you find this
confusing, you can pipe the list through <CODE>colrm</CODE> to eliminate one
column.  Type <CODE>help|colrm 37</CODE> to show just the first column, and
<CODE>help|colrm 1 36</CODE> to show just the second column.
<P>Many Linux programs from the Free Software Foundation are best
documented in info pages.  For example, the C compiler documentation
can be displayed by typing <CODE>info gcc</CODE>.
<P>Under Unix, commands normally accept options starting with a
minus sign rather than the forward slash used under DOS.  In a path,
directory names are separated by forward slashes rather than backward
slashes.  Both operating systems have a "standard input", by default
the keyboard, and a "standard output", by default the display screen.
You can redirect the standard input using "&lt;", and redirect the output
using "&gt;".  You can use the output from one command as the input of
another by separating the two commands with "|".  This is called the
"pipe" symbol.
<P>
<P>If a program gets "stuck", here is a sequence of keystrokes to
try:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Control-Q.  You may have sent a control-S, which halts
all output, without realizing it.  The control-Q will restart it.</LI>
<LI>Control-D, which signals "end of file" under Unix (similar to control-Z
under DOS), in case the program expects input which you are not
prepared to supply.</LI>
<LI>Control-C is an interrupt, which may halt the program.</LI>
<LI>Control-Z puts the program in the background.  At this point you may
simply log out, although you will be warned about the background
process and will have to repeat the <CODE>logout</CODE> command.  You can instead
kill the process, as follows: Run <CODE>ps</CODE> with no arguments.  It will
list a header line, then one line for each of your processes.  The
first item on each line is the process id number, or PID.  The command
used to start the process (or at least the beginning of it) appears at
the end of the line.  If the PID were 117, you would kill the process
with the command <CODE>kill -9 117</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>If running Linux from the console, alt-2, or some other
alt-number combination, will switch to a different virtual console.  
You can log in there just as if you had
sat down to a different terminal.</LI>
<LI>If your machine is connected to a network, you can log in from
another machine.</LI>
<LI>Control-alt-del should reboot the computer nondestructively.</LI>
<LI>As a last resort, you can hit "reset" or cycle the power.
This will leave the filesystems in an invalid state, since some
buffers will not have been written to disk.  The kernel will discover
this while booting, and will take time to check and repair the
filesystems.  Actual data loss is unlikely unless you had something
else going on at the time.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="emacs"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Learning Emacs</A>
</H2>

<P>When you start Emacs, you will normally list on the command line one
or more files which you will be editing.  To edit a file named
"foobar" with Emacs, you would enter the command <CODE>emacs foobar</CODE>.
If you enter the command <CODE>emacs</CODE> with no arguments, GNU Emacs will
print out an introduction which includes the first five commands you
need to learn, approximately as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
   Type C-h for help;   (`C-' means use CTRL key.)
   Type C-x u to undo changes.
   Type C-h t for a tutorial on using Emacs.
   Type C-h i to enter Info, which you can use to read GNU documentation.
   To kill the Emacs job, type C-x C-c.
</PRE>
<P>Note the way Emacs documentation refers to key combinations.
C-h means hold the control key down while typing "h".  You will also
run into key combinations like M-v, which is pronounced "meta v".  The
tutorial suggests holding down the key labeled "edit" or "meta" then
typing "v".  I have never run across a keyboard with those keys, so I
always use the escape key instead: typing "Esc" then "v" (two separate
keystrokes).  After using Emacs for a long time, I discovered that
under Linux, the left "Alt" key works like a "meta" key.  You may want
to use this.  On the other hand, some of these key combinations may
conflict with your screen reader or communications program under DOS.
Using the escape key is more reliable.
<P>Three of the above commands start with C-h, which may be treated as a
backspace by your communications program.  In that case, you may
access the help command using the long form M-x help.  Conversely, you
may find that pressing the backspace key starts the help command.
This issue is treated in the Emacs FAQ, which is available within
Emacs using C-h F or M-x help F.  Look for the question "Why does the
`Backspace' key invoke help?".  In the mean time, you can end the help
session with the command C-g.  (This is the keyboard-quit command,
which cancels any prefix keys you have typed.)
<P>You may also find that C-s and C-q are unavailable because they are
used for flow control (XON and XOFF).  You should look at the question
"How do I handle C-s and C-q being used for flow control?" in the FAQ.
For the particular command C-x C-s (save buffer), you may substitute
the command C-x s (save-some-buffers).  The former command saves the
current buffer, while the latter asks the user about each of the
modified buffers.
<P>Note in particular the command "C-h t" to start the Emacs tutorial.
That is one the first things you will want to try.  I will only make a
couple of comments on the tutorial.  To move the cursor, it gives the
four commands C-f, C-b, C-p, and C-n (for forward, back, previous
line, and next line).  These commands always work.  However, with a
properly installed Emacs, the regular arrow keys should also work.
Try them out and use them if you are more comfortable with them.
Similarly, you may be able to use home, end, page down, and page up
keys in place of the standard commands C-a, C-e, C-v, and M-v.
Finally, all Emacspeak commands begin with C-e.  Once you start using
Emacspeak, you will have to type it twice to get the end of line
function.  (The "End" key should be unaffected by Emacspeak.)
