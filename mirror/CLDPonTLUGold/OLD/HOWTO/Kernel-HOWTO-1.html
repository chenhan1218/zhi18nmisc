<P>
<P>Should you read this document? Well, see if you've got any of the following
symptoms:
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> ``Arg! This wizzo-46.5.6 package says it needs kernel
release 2.8.193 and I still only have release 1.0.9!''</LI>
<LI> There's a device driver in one of the newer kernels that
you just gotta have</LI>
<LI> You really have no idea at all how to compile a kernel</LI>
<LI> ``Is this stuff in the README <I>really</I> the whole story?''</LI>
<LI> You came, you tried, it didn't work</LI>
<LI> You need something to give to people who insist on asking you to
install their kernels for them</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Read this first! (I mean it)</A>
</H2>

<P>Some of the examples in this document assume that you have GNU <CODE>tar</CODE>,
<CODE>find</CODE>, and <CODE>xargs</CODE>. These are quite standard; this should
not cause problems. It is also assumed that
you know your system's filesystem structure; if you don't, it is critical
that you keep a written copy of the <CODE>mount</CODE> command's output during
normal system operation (or a listing of <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE>, if you can
read it). This information is important, and does not change unless you
repartition your disk, add a new one, reinstall your system, or something
similar.
<P>
<P>The latest ``production'' kernel version at the time of this writing was
2.2.9, meaning that the references and examples correspond to that
release. Even though I try to make this document as version-independent as
possible, the kernel is constantly under development, so if you get a
newer release, it will inevitably have some differences. Again, this should
not cause major problems, but it may create some confusion.
<P>
<P>There are two versions of the linux kernel source, ``production'' and
``development.'' Production releases are the even-minor-numbered releases;
1.2.x was production, 2.0.x is production, as well as 2.2.x. These kernels
are considered to be the
most stable, bug-free versions available at the time of release. The
development kernels (2.1.x, 2.3.x, etc) are meant as testing kernels, for
people willing to test out new and possibly very buggy kernels. You have
been warned.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 A word on style</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE>Text that looks like this</CODE> is either something that appears on
your screen, a filename, or something that can be directly typed in, such as a
command, or options to a command (if you're looking
at a plain-text file, it doesn't look any different). Commands and other
input are frequently quoted (with ` '), which causes the following
classic punctuation problem: if such an item appears at the end of a sentence
in quotes, people often type a `.' along with the command, because the
American quoting style says to put the period inside of the quotation
marks. Even though common sense (and unfortunately, this assumes that the
one with the ``common sense'' is used to the so-called American style of
quotation) should tell one to strip off the
punctuation first, many people simply do not remember, so I will place
it outside the quotation marks in such cases. In other words, when
indicating that you should type ``<CODE>make config</CODE>'' I would write 
`<CODE>make config</CODE>', not `<CODE>make config</CODE>.'
