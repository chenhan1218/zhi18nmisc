<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Important questions and their answers </A></H2>

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 What does the kernel do, anyway? </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The Unix kernel acts as a mediator for your programs and your hardware.
First, it does (or arranges for) the memory management for all of the
running programs (processes), and makes sure that they all get a fair (or
unfair, if you please) share of the processor's cycles. In addition, it
provides a nice, fairly portable interface for programs to talk to your
hardware.
<P>
<P>There is certainly more to the kernel's operation than this, but these
basic functions are the most important to know.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Why would I want to upgrade my kernel? </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Newer kernels generally offer the ability to talk to more types of
hardware (that is, they have more device drivers), they can have better
process management, they can run faster than the older versions, they
could be more stable than the older versions, and they fix silly bugs in
the older versions. Most people upgrade kernels because they want the
device drivers and the bug fixes.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 What kind of hardware do the newer kernels support? </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>See the Hardware-HOWTO. Alternatively, you can look at the
`<CODE>config.in</CODE>' file in the linux source, or just find out
when you try `<CODE>make config</CODE>'.
This shows you all hardware supported by the
standard kernel distribution, but not everything that linux supports; many
common device drivers (such as the PCMCIA drivers and some tape drivers) are
loadable modules maintained and distributed separately.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 What version of gcc and libc do I need? </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Linus recommends a version of gcc in the <CODE>README</CODE> file included with
the linux source. If you don't have this version, the documentation in the
recommended version of gcc should tell you if you need to upgrade your libc.
This is not a difficult procedure, but it is important to follow the
instructions.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 What's a loadable module? </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>These are pieces of kernel code which are not
linked (included) directly in the kernel. One compiles them separately,
and can insert and remove them into the running kernel at almost any
time. Due to its flexibility, this is now the preferred way to code certain
kernel features. Many popular device drivers, such as the PCMCIA
drivers and the QIC-80/40 tape driver, are loadable modules.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 How much disk space do I need? </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>It depends on your particular system configuration. First, the compressed
linux source is nearly 14 megabytes large at version 2.2.9. Many sites keep
this even after unpacking.
Uncompressed and built with a moderate configuration, it takes up another 67
MB.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 How long does it take? </A>
</H2>

<P>With newer machines, the compilation takes dramatically less time than
older ones; an AMD K6-2/300 with a fast disk can do a 2.2.x kernel in about
four minutes. As for old Pentiums, 486s, and 386s, if you plan to compile
one, be prepared to wait, possibly hours, days..
<P>If this troubles you, and you happen to have a faster machine around to
compile on, you can build on the fast machines (assuming you give it the
right parameters, that your ulilities are up-to-date, and so on), and then
transfer the kernel image to the slower machine.
