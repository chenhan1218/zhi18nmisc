<!--NIS/YP, theory of operation--></H2>

<P>Within a network there must be at least one machine acting as a NIS
server. You can have multiple NIS servers, each serving different NIS
"domains" - or you can have cooperating NIS servers, where one is the
master NIS server, and all the other are so-called slave NIS servers
(for a certain NIS "domain", that is!) - or you can have a mix
of them...
<P>Slave servers only have copies of the NIS databases and receive these
copies from the master NIS server whenever changes are made to the
master's databases.  Depending on the number of machines in your
network and the reliability of your network, you might decide to
install one or more slave servers.  Whenever a NIS server goes down or
is too slow in responding to requests, a NIS client connected to that
server will try to find one that is up or faster.
<P>NIS databases are in so-called DBM format, derived from ASCII
databases.  For example, the files <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> and
<CODE>/etc/group</CODE> can be directly converted to DBM format using
ASCII-to-DBM translation software ("makedbm", included with the
server software). The master NIS server should have both, the ASCII
databases and the DBM databases.
<P>Slave servers  will be notified of any change to the NIS maps, (via the
"yppush" program), and automatically retrieve the necessary changes in
order to synchronize their databases. NIS clients do not need to do
this since they always talk to the NIS server to read the information
stored in it's DBM databases.
<P>Old ypbind versions do a broadcast to find a running NIS server.
This is insecure, due the fact that anyone may install a NIS server
and answer the broadcast queries. Newer Versions of ypbind
(ypbind-3.3 or ypbind-mt) are able to get the server from a
configuration file - thus no need to broadcast.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 How NIS+ works</A>
<!--NIS+!theory of operation--></H2>

<P>NIS+ is a new version of the network information nameservice from Sun.
The biggest difference between NIS and NIS+ is that NIS+ has
support for data encryption and authentication over secure RPC.
<P>The  naming  model of NIS+ is based upon a tree structure. Each node in
the tree corresponds to an NIS+ object, from which we have six types:
directory, entry, group, link, table and private.
<P>The NIS+ directory that forms the root of the NIS+ namespace is called
the root directory. There are two special NIS+ directories:
org_dir and groups_dir. The org_dir directory consists of all
administration tables, such as passwd, hosts, and mail_aliases. The
groups_dir directory consists of NIS+ group objects which are used for
access control. The collection of org_dir, groups_dir and their parent
directory is referred to as an NIS+ domain.
