<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 But first some dry theory</A>
</H2>

<P>First of all: you read all the stuff before here right? You have
to.
<P>
<P>Before we <EM>really</EM> start this section I'm going to serve you
some theory on and an example of how DNS works.  And you're going to
read it because it's good for you.  If you don't want to you should at
least skim it very quickly.  Stop skimming when you get to what should
go in your <CODE>named.conf</CODE> file.
<P>
<P>DNS is a hierarchical, tree structured, system.  The top is written
`<CODE>.</CODE>' and pronounced `root', as is usual for tree data-structures.
Under <CODE>.</CODE> there are a number of Top Level Domains (TLDs); the best
known ones are <CODE>ORG</CODE>, <CODE>COM</CODE>, <CODE>EDU</CODE> and <CODE>NET</CODE>, but there
are many more.  Just like a tree it has a root and it branches out.
If you have any computer science background you will recognize DNS as
a search tree, and you will be able to find nodes, leaf nodes and
edges.  The dots are nodes, the edges are on the names.
<P>
<P>When looking for a machine the query proceeds recursively into the
hierarchy starting at the root.  If you want to find the address of
<CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu.</CODE>, your nameserver has to start asking somewhere.
It starts by looking it its cache.  If it knows the answer, having
cached it before, it will answer right away as we saw in the last
section.  If it does not know it will remove parts from the name
starting at the left, checking if it knows anything about
<CODE>ai.mit.edu.</CODE>, then <CODE>mit.edu.</CODE>, then <CODE>edu.</CODE> and if not that
it does know about <CODE>.</CODE> because that was in the hints file.  It will
then ask a <CODE>.</CODE> server about <CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>. This <CODE>.</CODE>
server will not know the answer, but it will help your server on its
way by giving a referral, telling it where to look instead.  These
referrals will eventually lead your server to a nameserver that knows
the answer.  I will illustrate that now.  <CODE>+norec</CODE> means that dig
is asking non-recursive questions so that we get to do the recursion
ourselves.  The other options are to reduce the amount of dig produces
so this won't go on for too many pages:

<P>
<P>This time we got a "ANSWER SECTION", and an answer for our
question.  The "AUTHORITY SECTION" contains information about which
servers to ask about <CODE>ai.mit.edu</CODE> the next time.  So you can ask
them directly the next time you wonder about <CODE>ai.mit.edu</CODE> names.
<P>
<P>So starting at <CODE>.</CODE> we found the successive name servers for each
level in the domain name by referral.  If you had used your own DNS
server instead of using all those other servers, your named would
of-course cache all the information it found while digging this out
for you, and it would not have to ask again for a while.
<P>
<P>In the tree analogue each ``<CODE>.</CODE>'' in the name is a branching
point.  And each part between the ``<CODE>.</CODE>''s are the names of
individual branches in the tree.  One climbs the tree by taking the
name we want (<CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>) asking the root (<CODE>.</CODE>) or
whatever servers father from the root toward prep.ai.mit.edu we have
information about in the cache.  Once the cache limits are reached
the recursive resolver goes out asking servers, pursuing referrals
(edges) further into the name.
<P>
<P>A much less talked about, but just as important domain is
<CODE>in-addr.arpa</CODE>.  It too is nested like the `normal' domains.
<CODE>in-addr.arpa</CODE> allows us to get the host's name when we have its
address.  A important thing to note here is that the IP addresses are
written in reverse order in the <CODE>in-addr.arpa</CODE> domain.  If you have
the address of a machine: <CODE>192.148.52.43</CODE> named proceeds just like
for the <CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE> example: find <CODE>arpa.</CODE> servers.  Find
<CODE>in-addr.arpa.</CODE> servers, find <CODE>192.in-addr.arpa.</CODE> servers, find
<CODE>148.192.in-addr.arpa.</CODE> servers, find <CODE>52.148.192.in-addr.arpa.</CODE>
servers.  Find needed records for <CODE>43.52.148.192.in-addr.arpa.</CODE>
Clever huh? (Say `yes'.)  The reversion of the numbers can be
confusing for years though.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Our own domain</A>
</H2>

<P>Now to define our own domain.  We're going to make the domain
<CODE>linux.bogus</CODE> and define machines in it.  I use a totally bogus
domain name to make sure we disturb no-one Out There.
<P>
<P>One more thing before we start: Not all characters are allowed in
host names.  We're restricted to the characters of the English
alphabet: a-z, and numbers 0-9 and the character '-' (dash).  Keep to
those characters.  Upper and lower-case characters are the same for
DNS, so <CODE>pat.uio.no</CODE> is identical to <CODE>Pat.UiO.No</CODE>.
<P>
<P>We've already started this part with this line in <CODE>named.conf</CODE>:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        file "pz/127.0.0";
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>Please note the lack of `<CODE>.</CODE>' at the end of the domain names in
this file.  This says that now we will define the zone
<CODE>0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</CODE>, that we're the master server for it and
that it is stored in a file called <CODE>pz/127.0.0</CODE>.  We've already
set up this file, it reads:

</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>Please note the `<CODE>.</CODE>' at the end of all the full domain names in
this file, in contrast to the <CODE>named.conf</CODE> file above. Some people
like to start each zone file with a <CODE>$ORIGIN</CODE> directive, but
this is superfluous.  The origin (where in the DNS hierarchy it
belongs) of a zone file is specified in the zone section of the
<CODE>named.conf</CODE> file; in this case it's <CODE>0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</CODE>.
<P>
<P>This `zone file' contains 3 `resource records' (RRs): A SOA RR.  A
NS RR and a PTR RR.  SOA is short for Start Of Authority.  The `@' is a
special notation meaning the origin, and since the `domain' column for
this file says 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa the first line really means
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.   IN      SOA ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>NS is the Name Server RR.  There is no '@' at the start of this
line; it is implicit since the previous line started with a '@'.
Saves some typing that.  So the NS line could also be written
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.   IN      NS      ns.linux.bogus
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>It tells DNS what machine is the name server of the domain
<CODE>0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</CODE>, it is <CODE>ns.linux.bogus</CODE>.  'ns' is a
customary name for name-servers, but as with web servers who are
customarily named <CODE>www.</CODE><EM>something</EM> the name may be anything.
<P>
<P>And finally the PTR (Domain Name Pointer) record says that the host
at address 1 in the subnet <CODE>0.0.127.in-addr.arpa</CODE>, i.e., 127.0.0.1
is named <CODE>localhost</CODE>.
<P>
<P>The SOA record is the preamble to <EM>all</EM> zone files, and there
should be exactly one in each zone file.  It describes the zone, where
it comes from (a machine called <CODE>ns.linux.bogus</CODE>), who is
responsible for its contents (<CODE>hostmaster@linux.bogus</CODE>; you should
insert your e-mail address here), what version of the zone file this
is (serial: 1), and other things having to do with caching and
secondary DNS servers.  For the rest of the fields (refresh, retry,
expire and minimum) use the numbers used in this HOWTO and you should
be safe.  Before the SOA comes a mandatory line, the <CODE>$TTL 3D</CODE>
line.  Put it in all your zone files.
<P>
<P>Now restart your named (the command is <CODE>ndc restart</CODE>) and use
dig to examine your handy work.  <CODE>-x</CODE> asks for the inverse query:
<P>

<P>
<P>Two things must be noted about the SOA record.  <CODE>ns.linux.bogus</CODE>
<EM>must</EM> be a actual machine with a A record.  It is not legal to
have a CNAME record for the machine mentioned in the SOA record.  Its
name need not be `ns', it could be any legal host name.  Next,
hostmaster.linux.bogus should be read as hostmaster@linux.bogus.  This
should be a mail alias, or a mailbox, where the person(s) maintaining
DNS should read mail frequently.  Any mail regarding the domain will
be sent to the address listed here.  The name need not be
`hostmaster', it can be your normal e-mail address, but the e-mail
address `hostmaster' is often expected to work as well.
<P>
<P>There is one new RR type in this file, the MX, or Mail eXchanger
RR.  It tells mail systems where to send mail that is addressed to
<CODE>someone@linux.bogus</CODE>, namely to <CODE>mail.linux.bogus</CODE> or
<CODE>mail.friend.bogus</CODE>.  The number before each machine name is that
MX RR's priority.  The RR with the lowest number (10) is the one mail
should be sent to if possible.  If that fails the mail can be sent to
one with a higher number, a secondary mail handler, i.e.,
<CODE>mail.friend.bogus</CODE> which has priority 20 here.

<P>is correct.  I prefer the latter form, it's less to type.  There are
some BIND experts that disagree, and some that agree with this.  In a
zone file the domain should either be written out and ended with a
`<CODE>.</CODE>' or it should not be included at all, in which case it
defaults to the origin.
<P>
<P>I must stress that in the named.conf file there should <EM>not</EM> be
`<CODE>.</CODE>'s after the domain names.  You have no idea how many times a
`<CODE>.</CODE>' too many or few have fouled up things and confused the h*ll
out of people.
<P>
<P>So having made my point here is the new zone file, with some extra
information in it as well:

<P>
<P>There are a number of new RRs here: HINFO (Host INFOrmation) has
two parts; it's a good habit to quote each.  The first part is the
hardware or CPU on the machine, and the second part the software or OS
on the machine.  The machine called 'ns' has a Pentium CPU and runs
Linux 2.0.  CNAME (Canonical NAME) is a way to give each machine
several names.  So www is an alias for ns.
<P>
<P>CNAME record usage is a bit controversial. But it's safe to follow
the rule that a MX, CNAME or SOA record should <EM>never</EM> refer to a
CNAME record, they should only refer to something with an A record, so
it is inadvisable to have
<P>

<PRE>
foobar          CNAME   www                     ; NO!

<PRE>
foobar          CNAME   ns                      ; Yes!
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>It's also safe to assume that a CNAME is not a legal host name for
an e-mail address: <CODE>webmaster@www.linux.bogus</CODE> is an illegal e-mail
address given the setup above.  You can expect quite a few mail admins
Out There to enforce this rule even if it works for you.  The way to
avoid this is to use A records (and perhaps some others too, like a MX
record) instead:

at all. But the discussion of why or why not is beyond the scope of
this HOWTO.

<P>But as you see, this HOWTO and many sites do not follow this rule.

<P>
<P>Looks good!  If your output didn't look like that look for
error-messages in your syslog, I explained how to do that in the first
section under the heading 
<A HREF="DNS-HOWTO-3.html#starting">Starting named</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Words of caution</A>
</H2>

<P>There are some things I should add here.  The IP numbers used in
the examples above are taken from one of the blocks of 'private nets',
i.e., they are not allowed to be used publicly on the Internet.  So
they are safe to use in an example in a HOWTO.  The second thing is
the <CODE>notify no;</CODE> line.  It tells named not to notify its secondary
(slave) servers when it has gotten a update to one of its zone files.
In BIND-8 the named can notify the other servers listed in NS records
in the zone file when a zone is updated.  This is handy for ordinary
use.  But for private experiments with zones this feature should be
off --- we don't want the experiment to pollute the Internet do we?
<P>
<P>And, of course, this domain is highly bogus, and so are all the
addresses in it.  For a real example of a real-life domain see the
next main-section.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Why reverse lookups don't work.</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a couple of ``gotchas'' that normally are avoided with
name lookups that are often seen when setting up reverse zones.
Before you go on you need reverse lookups of your machines working on
your own nameserver.  If it isn't go back and fix it before
continuing.
<P>
<P>I will discuss two failures of reverse lookups as seen from outside
your network:
<P>
<H3>The reverse zone isn't delegated.</H3>

<P>When you ask a service provider for a network-address range and a
domain name the domain name is normally delegated as a matter of course.
A delegation is the glue NS record that helps you get from one
nameserver to another as explained in the dry theory section above.
You read that, right?  If your reverse zone doesn't work go back and
read it.  Now.
<P>
<P>The reverse zone also needs to be delegated.  If you got the
<CODE>192.168.196</CODE> net with the <CODE>linux.bogus</CODE> domain from your
provider they need to put <CODE>NS</CODE> records in for your reverse zone as
well as for your forward zone.  If you follow the chain from
<CODE>in-addr.arpa</CODE> and up to your net you will probably find a break in
the chain, most probably at your service provider.  Having found the
break in the chain contact your service-provider and ask them to
correct the error.
<P>
<H3>You've got a classless subnet</H3>

<P>This is a somewhat advanced topic, but classless subnets are very
common these days and you probably have one if you're a small company.
<P>
<P>A classless subnet is what keeps the Internet going these days.
Some years ago there was much ado about the shortage of IP numbers.
The smart people in IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force, they
keep the Internet working) stuck their heads together and solved the
problem.  At a price.  The price is that you'll get less than a ``C''
subnet and some things may break.  Please see 
<A HREF="http://www.acmebw.com/askmrdns/00007.htm">Ask Mr. DNS at</A> for an good
explanation of this and how to handle it.
<P>
<P>Did you read it?  I'm not going to explain it so please read it.
<P>
<P>The first part of the problem is that your ISP must understand the
technique described by Mr. DNS.  Not all small ISPs have a working
understanding of this.  If so you might have to explain to them and be
persistent.  But be sure you understand it first ;-).  They will then
set up a nice reverse zone at their server which you can examine for
correctness with dig.
<P>
<P>The second and last part of the problem is that you must understand
the technique.  If you're unsure go back and read about it again.
Then you can set up your own classless reverse zone as described by
Mr. DNS.
<P>
<P>There is another trap lurking here.  Old resolvers will <EM>not</EM> be
able to follow the <CODE>CNAME</CODE> trick in the resolving chain and will
fail to reverse-resolve your machine.  This can result in the service
assigning it an incorrect access class, deny access or something along
those lines.  If you stumble into such a service the only solution
(that I know of) is for your ISP to insert your PTR record directly
into their trick classless zone file instead of the trick CNAME
record.
<P>
<P>Some ISPs will offer other ways to handle this, like Web based
forms for you to input your reverse-mappings in or other automagical
systems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Slave servers</A>
</H2>

<P>Once you have set up your zones correctly on the master servers you
need to set up at least one slave server.  Slave servers are needed
for robustness.  If your master goes down the people out there on the
net will still be able to get information about your domain from the
slave.  A slave should be as long away from you as possible.  Your
master and slave should share as few as possible of these: Power
supply, LAN, ISP, city and country.  If all of these things are
different for your master and slave you've found a really good slave.
<P>
<P>A slave is simply a nameserver that copies zone files from a
master.  You set it up like this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
zone "linux.bogus" {

<P>A mechanism called zone-transfer is used to copy the data.  The
zone transfer is controlled by your SOA record:

<P>
<P>A zone is only transferred if the serial number on the master is
larger than on the slave.  Every refresh interval the slave will check
if the master has been updated.  If the check fails (because the
master is unavailable) it will retry the check every retry interval.
If it continues to fail as long as the expire interval the slave will
remove the zone from it's filesystem and no longer be a server for it.
