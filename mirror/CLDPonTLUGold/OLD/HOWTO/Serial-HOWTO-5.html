<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Intro to Multiport Serial </A>
</H2>

<P> Multiport serial cards install in slots in a PC on the ISA or PCI
bus.  Instead of being called "... cards" they are also called "...
adapters" or "... boards".  Each such card provides you with many
serial ports.  Today they are commonly used for the control of
external devices (including automation for both industry and the
home).  They can connect to computer servers for the purpose of
monitoring/controlling the server from a remote location.  They were
once mainly used for connecting up many terminals and/or modems to
serial ports.  They are still used this way but today most modems are
internal digital modems (often called something else) and they don't
usually use multiport serial cards.
<P>Each multiport card has a number of external connecters (DB-25 or
RJ45) so that one may connect up a number of devices (modems,
terminals, etc.).  Each such physical device would then be connected
to its own serial port.  Since the space on the external-facing part
of the card is limited there is often not enough room for all the
serial port connectors.  To solve this problem, the connectors may be
on the ends of cables which come out (externally) from the card
(octopus cable).  Or they may be on an external box (possibly rack
mountable) which is connected by a cable to a multiport card.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Modem Limitations</A>
</H2>

<P>For a modem to transmit at nearly 56k requires that it be a special
digital modem and have a digital connection to a digital phone line
(such as a T1 line).  Modem banks that connect to multiport cards do
exist, and some have a card that can access multiplexed digital phone
lines.   Thus one can use a multiport card with a few 56k digital
modems.  
<P>For both analog and digital modem there is one modem on each serial
port so there needs to be an external cable (modem bank to multiport)
for each modem.  This can lead to a large number of cables.  So it's
less clutter (and cheaper) to use internal modems without a multiport
card.  It's somewhat analogous to the lower cost of an internal modem
for a desktop PC as compared to the higher cost (and more cabling) for
an external modem.  See Modem-HOWTO: Modem Pools, Digital Modems.        
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Dumb vs. Smart Cards</A>
</H2>

<P>Dumb multiport cards are not too much different than ordinary serial
ports.  They are interrupt driven and the CPU of the computer does
most all the work servicing them.  They usually have a system of
sharing a single interrupt for all the ports.  This doesn't decrease
the load on the CPU since the single interrupt will be sent to the CPU
each time any one port needs servicing.  Such devices usually require
special drivers that you must put into the kernel or activate by
putting a #define in the source code (or the like).  
<P>Smart boards may use ordinary UARTs but handle most interrupts from
the UARTs internally within the board.  This frees the CPU from the
burden of handling  all these interrupts.  The board may save up bytes
in its large internal FIFOs and transfer perhaps 1k bytes at a time to
the serial buffer in main memory.  It may use the full bus width of 32
bits for making data transfers to main memory (instead of transferring
only 8-bit bytes like dumb serial cards do).  Not all "smart" boards
are equally efficient.  Many boards today are Plug-and-Play.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Getting/Enabling a Driver</A>
</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>For a multiport board to work, a special driver for it must be used.
This driver may either be built into the kernel source code or
supplied as a module.  Support for dumb boards is likely to the built
into the kernel while smart boards usually need a module.
<P>
<H3>Driver is built into the kernel (mostly dumb boards)</H3>

<P>A pre-compiled kernel is not likely to have multiport support
built in (especially after kernel 2.4).  So you probably need to compile
it yourself.  In kernel 2.4 you should select "CONFIG_SERIAL_EXTENDED
when configuring the kernel (just before you compile).  If you select
this there will be still more choices presented to you.  Even after
you do this you may need to edit the resulting source code a
little (depending on the card).
<P>
<H3>Modules (mostly for smart boards)</H3>

<P>A pre-compiled kernel may come with a pre-compiled module for the board 
so that you don't need to recompile the kernel.  This module must be
loaded in order to use it, but the kernel may automatically do this
for you if a program is trying to use a device on the smart board
(provided there exists a table showing which module to load for the
device).  This table may be in /etc/modules.conf and/or be internal to
the kernel.  Also certain parameters may need to be passed to the
driver (via lilo's append command or via /etc/modules.conf).  
<P>
<H3>Getting info on multiport boards</H3>

<P> The board's manufacturer should have info on their website.
Unfortunately, info for old boards is sometimes not there but might be
found somewhere else on the Internet (including discussion groups).
You might also want to look at the kernel documentation in
/usr/share/kernel-doc...  For configuring the kernel or modules prior
to compiling see: Configure.help and search for "serial", etc.  There
are also kernel documentation files for certain boards including
computone, hayes-esp, moxa-smartio, riscom8, specialix, stallion, and
sx (specialix).  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="make_multi"></A> <A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Making multiport devices in the /dev directory </A>
</H2>

<P>The serial ports your multiport board uses depends on what kind of board
you have.  Some have their own device names like /dev/ttyE27 or
/dev/ttyD2, etc.  Ones that use the standard names like /dev/ttyS14
may be listed in detail in <CODE>rc.serial</CODE> or in
<CODE>0setserial</CODE>.  These files may be included in a setserial or
serial package.  You may need to create these devices (unless an
installation script does it for you).  Either use the <CODE>mknod</CODE>
command, or the <CODE>MAKEDEV</CODE> script.  Devices (in the /dev directory)
for ttyS type serial ports are made by adding ``64 + port number''.
So, if you wanted to create devices for <CODE>ttyS17</CODE>, you would
type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
linux# mknod -m 666 /dev/ttyS17 c 4 81
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note the "major" number is always 4 for ttyS devices (and 5 for the
obsolete cua devices).  Also ``64 + 17 = 81''.  Using the <CODE>MAKEDEV</CODE>
script, you would type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
linux# cd /dev
linux# ./MAKEDEV ttyS17
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For the names and numbers of other types of serial ports other than
ttyS.. see devices.txt in the kernel documentation.  Besides the
listing of various brands of multiports found in this HOWTO there is
<A HREF="http://members.aa.net/~swear/pedia/serialcards.html">Gary's Encyclopedia - Serial Cards</A>.  It's not as complete, but
may have some different links.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Standard PC Serial Cards</A>
</H2>

<P> In olden days PCs came with a serial card installed.  Later on the
serial function was put on the hard-drive interface card.  Today, one
or two serial ports are usually built into the motherboard.  Most of
them (as of 2001) use a 16550 but some use 16650 (32-byte FIFOs). 
But one may still buy the old PC serial cards if they need 1-4 more
serial ports.  These are for ttyS0-ttyS3 (COM1 - COM4).  They can be
used to connect external serial devices (modems, serial mice, etc...).
Only a tiny percentage of retail computer stores carry such cards.
But one can purchase them on the Internet.  Before getting a PCI one,
make sure Linux supports it.
<P>Here's a list of a few popular brands:

<P>Note: due to address conflicts, you may not be able to use COM4 and
IBM8514 video card (or some others) simultaneously.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-12.html#8514_">Avoiding IO Address Conflicts with Certain Video Boards</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 Dumb Multiport Serial Boards (with standard UART chips) </A>
</H2>

<P> They are also called "serial adapters".  They often have a
special method of sharing interrupts which requires that you compile
support for them into the kernel.<BR>

<P>In general, Linux will support any serial board which uses a 8250, 
16450, 16550, 16550A, 16650, etc. UART.  See the latest man page for
"setserial" for a more complete list.
<P>Notes: 
<P>AST Fourport: You might need to specify <CODE>skip_test</CODE> in <CODE>rc.serial</CODE>.
<P>BB-1004 and BB-1008 do not support DCD and RI lines, and thus are not
usable for dialin modems.  They will work fine for all other purposes.
<P>Digi PC/8 Interrupt Status Register is at 0x140.
<P>SIIG IO1812 manual for the listing for COM5-COM8 is
wrong.  They should be COM5=0x250, COM6=0x258, COM7=0x260, and
COM8=0x268.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.8">5.8 Intelligent Multiport Serial Boards</A>
</H2>

<P>Make sure that a Linux-compatible driver is available and read the
information that comes with it.  These boards use special devices (in
the /dev directory), and not the standard ones.  This information
varies depending on your hardware.  If you have updated info which
should be shown here please email it to me.
<P>Names of Linux driver modules are *.o but these may not work for all
models shown.  Also, parameters (such as the io and irq often need to
be given to the module so you need to find instructions on this
(possibly in the source code tree).  To check on the latest serial
driver go to 
<A HREF="http://serial.sourceforge.net/">Linux Serial Driver home page</A><P>There are many different brands, each of which often offers many
different cards.  No attempt is currently being made to list all the
cards here (and many listed are obsolete).  But all major brands and
websites should be shown here so it something is missing let me know.
Go the the webpage shown for more information.  These websites often
also have info (ads) on related hardware such as modem pools, remote
access servers (RASs), and terminal servers.  Where there is no
webpage, the cards are likely obsolete.  If you would like to put
together a better list, let me know.
