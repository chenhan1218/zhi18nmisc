<P>After researching all the available databases which are <B>free</B> and source code 
is available, it was found that ONLY PostgreSQL is the MOST mature, most 
widely used and robust RDBMS SQL free database (object relational) in the world.
<P>PostgreSQL is very appealing since lot of work had already been done. It
has ODBC and JDBC drivers, using these it is possible to write applications
independent of the databases. The applications written in PostgreSQL using 
ODBC, JDBC drivers are easily portable to other databases like Oracle, 
Sybase and Informix and vice versa. 
<P>You may ask "But why PostgreSQL ?" The answer is, since it takes 
lot more time to develop a database
system from scratch, it makes sense to pick up a database system 
which satisfies the following conditions -
<P>A database system
<UL>
<LI> Whose source code is available - Must be a 'Open Source Code' system</LI>
<LI> Has no license strings, no ownership strings attached to it</LI>
<LI> Which can be distributed on internet</LI>
<LI> Which had been on development for several years.</LI>
<LI> Which satisfies standards like ISO/ANSI SQL 92 (and SQL 89)</LI>
<LI> Which can satisfy future needs like SQL 3 (SQL 98)</LI>
<LI> Which has advanced capabilities</LI>
</UL>

And it just happens to be 'PostgreSQL' which satisfies all these
conditions and is an appropriate software for this situation.
You may say 'PostgreSQL' is a very strange name (It is pronounced 
as Post-gres-cue-el and not Postgre-es-cue-el. 
It's a very unusual name and it is very hard to pronounce).
But my argument is - why 
change the name. This world is stuck with "PostgreSQL" forever
and people all over the world love this name!!
