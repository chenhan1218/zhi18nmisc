<A NAME="Testing"></A> <P>Finally, it's time to give IP Masquerading an official try after all this hard work.  If you haven't already rebooted your Linux box, do so to make sure the machines boots ok, executes the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ruleset, etc. Next, make sure that both the internal LAN connection and connection of your Linux hosts to the Internet is okay. 
<P>Follow these -10- tests to make sure all aspects of your MASQ setup is
running properly:

<LI><B>Step One: Testing local PC connectivity</B>  
<P>From an internal MASQed computer, try pinging its local IP address (i.e. <EM>ping 192.168.0.10 </EM>).  This will verify that TCP/IP is correctly working on the local machine.  Almost ALL modern operating systems have built-in support for the "ping" command.  If this ping doesn't work, make sure that TCP/IP is correctly configured on the MASQed PC as described earlier in 
<A HREF="IP-Masquerade-HOWTO-3.html#Configuring-clients">Configuring-clients</A>
 section of this HOWTO.  The output should look something like the following (hit Control-C to abort the ping):
<HR>

<LI><B>Step Three: Testing External Linux connectivity</B>  
<P>Next ping the external IP address of the MASQ server's network interface card connected to the Internet.  This address might be from a PPP, Ethernet, etc connection to your ISP.  If you don't know what this IP address is, run the Linux command <EM>"/sbin/ifconfig"</EM> on the MASQ server itself to get the Internet address.  The output should look something like the following (we are looking for the IP address of eth0):
<HR>
<PRE>
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:08:C7:A4:CC:5B  
          inet addr:12.13.14.15  Bcast:64.220.150.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1

          TX packets:5422798 errors:8 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:8
          collisions:4675 txqueuelen:100 
          Interrupt:11 Base address:0xfcf0 
  
</PRE>
<HR>

As you can see from the above, the external IP address is "12.13.14.15" for
this example.  So, now that you have your IP address after running the "ipconfig" command, ping your external IP address.  This will confirm that the MASQ server has full network connectivity.  The output should look something like the following (hit Control-C to abort the ping):
<HR>
<PRE>
masq-server# ping 12.13.14.15
PING 12.13.14.15 (12.13.14.15): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 12.13.14.15: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.8 ms
64 bytes from 12.13.14.15: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=0.4 ms
64 bytes from 12.13.14.15: icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=0.4 ms
64 bytes from 12.13.14.15: icmp_seq=3 ttl=255 time=0.5 ms

--- 12.13.14.15 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.4/0.5/0.8 ms
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>If either of these tests doesn't work, you need to go back and double check your network cabling, and verify that the two NICs in the MASQ server are seen in "dmesg".  An example of this output would be the following towards the END of the "dmesg" command:

<P>On a internal MASQed computer, try pinging the IP address of the Masquerading Linux box's internal Ethernet card, (i.e. <EM>ping 192.168.0.1</EM>).  This will prove that your internal network and routing is ok.  The output should look something like the following (hit Control-C to abort the ping):

<P>If this fails, make sure Ethernet cards of the MASQ server and the MASQed computer have "link".  This is usually a LED light on either the back of each Ethernet card and also on the Ethernet hub/switch (if you are using one).   If this fails, make sure that the internal MASQ machine is correctly configured as shown in the 
<A HREF="IP-Masquerade-HOWTO-3.html#Configuring-clients">Configuring-clients</A>
 section.  If the MASQ client is ok, double-check your network cabling, make sure you have a LINK light on both the internal MASQed computer's NIC -and- the internal NIC on the Linux box.

<P>From an internal MASQed computer, ping the IP address of the MASQ server's EXTERNAL TCP/IP address obtained in Step THREE above.  This address might be your PPP, Ethernet, etc. address connected to your ISP.  This ping test will prove that masquerading is working (ICMP Masquerading specifically).  
<P>If it doesn't work, first make sure that the "Default Gateway" on the MASQed PC is pointing to the IP address on the MASQ -SERVERs- INTERNAL NIC.  Also double check that the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script was run without any errors.  Just as a test, try re-running the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script now to see if it runs ok.  Also, though most kernels support it by default, make sure that you enabled "ICMP Masquerading" in the kernel comfiguration and "IP Forwarding" in your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script.  
<P>If you still can't get things to work, take a look at the output from the
following commands run on the Linux MASQ server:

<LI> "<EM>ifconfig</EM>" : Make sure the interface for your Internet connection (be it ppp0, eth0, etc.) is UP and you have the correct IP address for the Internet connection.  An example of this output is shown in STEP THREE above.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> "<EM>netstat -rn</EM>" : Make sure your default gateway (the column one with the IP address in the Gateway column) is set.  An example of this output might look like:

Notice that very LAST line that starts with 0.0.0.0?  Notice that it has an IP
address in the "Gateway" field?  You should an IP address for your specific
setup in that field.

If this works, that means that ICMP Masquerading is working over the Internet.  If it didn't work, again check your Internet connection.  If this still doesn't work, make sure you are using the simple rc.firewall ruleset and that you have ICMP Masqurading compiled into the Linux kernel.

<P>If you see The Linux Documentation Project homepage, then <B>CONGRATULATIONS! It's working!</B> If that WWW site comes up correctly, then all other standard network tolls such as PING, TELNET, SSH, and with their related IP MASQ modules loaded: FTP, Real Audio, IRC DCCs, Quake I/II/III, CuSeeme, VDOLive, etc. should work fine!  If FTP, IRC, RealAudio, Quake I/II/III, etc. aren't working or are performing poorly, make sure their associated Masquerading modules are loaded by running "lsmod" and also be sure you are loading the module with any non-default server ports.  If you don't see your needed module, make sure your /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script is loading them (i.e. remove the # character for a give IP MASQ module).
