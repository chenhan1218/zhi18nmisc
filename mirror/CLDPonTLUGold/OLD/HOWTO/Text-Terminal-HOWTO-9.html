<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Intro to Terminal Emulation</A>
</H2>

<P> Since a PC has a screen and keyboard (as does a terminal) but also
has much more computing power, it's easy to use some of this computing
power to make the PC computer behave like a text terminal.  This is
one type of terminal emulation.  Another type of terminal emulation is
where you set up a real terminal to emulate another brand/model of
terminal.  To do this you select the emulation you want (called
"personality" in Wyse jargon) from the terminal's set-up menu.  This
section is about the first type of emulation: emulating a terminal on
a PC.
<P>Much emulation software is available for use under the MS Windows OS.
See 
<A HREF="#non_linux_pc">Make a non-Linux PC a terminal</A>  This
can be used to connect a Windows PC to a Linux PC (as a
Text-Terminal).  Most Linux free software can only emulate a VT100,
VT102, or VT100/ANSI.  If you find out about any others, let me know.
Since most PC's have color monitors while VT100 and VT102 were
designed for a monochrome monitor, the emulation usually adds color
capabilities (including a choice of colors).  Sometimes the emulation
is not 100% perfect but this usually causes few problems.  For using a
Mac computer to emulate a terminal see the mini-howto: Mac-Terminal.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="term_not_for_emulation"></A> <A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Don't Use TERM For Emulation </A>
</H2>

<P> Some have erroneously thought that they could create an emulator
at a Linux console (monitor) by setting the environment variable TERM
to the type of terminal they would like to emulate.  This does not
work.  The value of TERM only tells an application program what
terminal you are using.  This way it doesn't need to interactively ask
you this question.  If you're at a Linux PC monitor (command line
interface) it's a terminal of type "Linux" and your can't change this.
So you must set TERM to "Linux".
<P>If you set it to something else you are fibbing to application
programs.  As a result they will incorrectly interpret certain escape
sequences from the console resulting in a corrupted interface.  Since
the Linux console behaves almost like a vt100 terminal, it could still
work almost OK if you falsely claimed it was a vt100 (or some other
terminal which is something like a vt100).  It may seeming work OK
most of the time but once in a while will make a mistake when editing
or the like.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Communication (Dialing) programs</A>
</H2>

<P> Dialing programs for making a PPP connection to the Internet don't
normally include any terminal emulation.  But some other modem dialing
programs (such as minicom or seyon) do.  Using them one may (for
example) dial up public libraries to use their catalogs and indexes,
(or even read magazine articles).  They are also useful for testing
modems.  Seyon is only for use with X-windows and can emulate
Tektronix 4014 terminals.  
<P>The communication program Kermit doesn't do terminal emulation as it
is merely a semi-transparent pipe between whatever terminal you are on
and the remote site you are connected to.  Thus if you use kermit on a
Linux PC the terminal type will be "Linux".  If you have a Wyse60
connected to your PC and run kermit on that, you will appear as a
Wyse60 to the remote computer (which may not be able to handle Wyse60
terminals).  Minicom emulates a VT102 and if you use it on Wyse60
terminal the Wyse escape sequences will get translated to VT102 escape
sequences before the data goes out to the modem.  Kermit can't do this.
<P>Emulators exist under DOS such as <CODE>telix</CODE> and <CODE>procomm</CODE> work
just as well.  The terminal emulated is often the old VT100, VT102, or
ANSI (like VT100).   
<P>
<H3>Emulation under X-Windows</H3>

<P> Xterm (obsolete ??) may be run under X-Windows which can emulate a
VT102, VT220, or Tektronix 4014.  There is also an xterm emulation
(although there is no physical terminal named "xterm").   If you don't
need the Tektronix 4014 emulation (a vector graphics terminal; see
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-2.html#vector_graphics">Graphics Terminals</A>) you may use
<CODE>eterm</CODE>.  Predecessors to <CODE>eterm</CODE> are <CODE>rxvt</CODE> and <CODE>xvt</CODE>.
<CODE>eterm</CODE> supports pixmaps.
<P>For non-Latin alphabets, kterm is for Kanji terminal emulation (or for
other non-Latin alphabets) while xcin is for Chinese.  There is also
9term emulation.  This seems to be more than just an emulator as it
has a built-in editor and scroll-bars.  It was designed for Plan 9, a
Unix-like operating system from AT&amp;T.
<P>
<H3>Real terminals better</H3>

<P> Unless you are using X-Windows with a large display, a real
terminal is often nicer to use than emulating one.  It usually costs
less, has better resolution for text, and has no disk drives to make
annoying noises.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Testing Terminal Emulation</A>
</H2>

<P> For the VT series terminals there is a test program: <CODE>vttest</CODE>
to help determine if a terminal behaves correctly like a vt53, vt100,
vt102, vt220, vt320, vt420 etc.  There is no documentation but it has
menus and is easy to use.  To compile it run the configure script and
then type "make".  It may be downloaded from: 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/console/">http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/console/</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="console_"></A> <A NAME="ss9.5">9.5 The Linux Console </A>
</H2>

<P> The console for a PC Linux system is normally the computer monitor
in text mode.  It emulates a terminal of type "Linux".  There is no
way (unless you want to spend weeks rewriting the kernel code) to get
it to emulate anything else.  Setting the TERM environment variable to
type of terminal other than "Linux" will not result in emulating that
other terminal.  It will only result in a corrupted interface since
you have falsely declared (via the TERM variable) that your "terminal"
is of a type different from what it actually is.  See 
<A HREF="#term_not_for_emulation">Don't Use TERM For Emulation</A><P>In some cases, the console for a Linux PC is a text-terminal.  One may
recompile Linux to make a terminal receive most of the messages which
normally go to the console.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-17.html#term_as_console">Make a Serial Terminal the Console</A>.
<P>The "Linux" emulation of the monitor is flexible and has features
which go well beyond those of the vt102 terminal which it was intended
to emulate.  These include the ability to use custom fonts and easily
re-map the keyboard.  These extra features reside in the console
driver software (including the keyboard driver).  The console driver
only works for the monitor and will not work for a real terminal even
if it's being used for the console.  Thus the "console driver" is
really a "monitor driver".  In the early days of Linux one couldn't
use a real terminal as the console so "monitor" and "console" were
once always the same thing.
<P>The stty commands work for the monitor-console just like it was a real
terminal.  They are handled by the same terminal driver that is used
for real terminals.  Bytes headed for the screen first go thru the
terminal (tty) driver and then thru the console driver.  For the monitor
some of the stty commands don't do anything (such as setting the baud rate).
You may set the monitor baud rate to any allowed value (such as a slow
300 speed) but the actual speed of putting text on the monitor screen
will not actually change.  The file /etc/ioctl.save stores stty
settings for use only when the console is in single user mode (but you
are normally in multiuser-user mode).  This is explained (a little) in the
init man page.
<P>Many commands exist to utilize the added features provided by the
console-monitor driver.   Real terminals, which use neither scan codes
nor VGA cards, unfortunately can't use these features.  To find out
more about the console see the Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO.  Also see
the various man pages about the console (type "man -k console").
Unfortunately, much of this documentation is outdated.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.6">9.6 Emulation Software</A>
</H2>

<P> Emulators often don't work quite right so before purchasing
software you should try to throughly check out what you will get.  
<P>
<H3>Make a Linux PC a terminal</H3>

<P> Unless you want to emulate the standard vt100 (or close to it).
There doesn't seem to be much free terminal emulation software
available for Linux.  The free programs minicom and seyon (only for
X-windows) can emulate a vt100 (or close to it).   Seyon can also
emulate a Tektronix 4014 terminal. 
<P>There's a specialized Linux distribution: Serial Terminal Linux.  It
will turn a PC to into a minicom-like terminal.  It's small (fits on a
floppy) and will not let you use the PC for any other purpose (when
it's running).  See 
<A HREF="http://members.wri.com/johnnyb/seriallinux/">http://members.wri.com/johnnyb/seriallinux/</A>.  It will let you
have more than one session running (similar to virtual terminals), one
for each serial port you have.
<P>TERM (non-free from Century Software) 
<A HREF="http://www.ecc400.com/censoft/termunix.html">http://www.ecc400.com/censoft/termunix.html</A> can emulate Wyse60,
50; VT 220, 102, 100, 52: TV950, 925, 912; PCTERM; ANSI; IBM3101;
ADM-1l; WANG 2110.  Block mode is available for IBM and Wyse.  It runs
on a Linux PC.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="non_linux_pc"></A> Make a non-Linux PC a terminal </H3>

<P> Emulators exist which run on non-Linux PCs.  They permit you to
use a non-Linux-PC as a terminal connected to a Linux-PC.  Under DOS
there is <CODE>telix</CODE> and <CODE>procomm</CODE>.   Windows comes with
"HyperTerminal" (formerly simply called "Terminal" in Windows 3.x and
DOS).  Competing with this is "HyperTerminal Private Edition" 
<A HREF="http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe/index.html">http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe/index.html</A> which is non-free to
business.  It can emulate vt-220.  Turbosoft's TTWin can emulate over
80 different terminals under Windows.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.ttwin.com/home.html">http://www.ttwin.com/home.html</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.turbosoft.com.au/">http://www.turbosoft.com.au/</A> (Australia).

<A HREF="http://www.wrq.com/">Reflection</A><P>For the Mac Computer there is emulation by Carnation Software 
<A HREF="http://www.carnationsoftware.com/carnation/HT.Carn.Home.html">http://www.carnationsoftware.com/carnation/HT.Carn.Home.html</A><P>One place to check terminal emulation products is Shuford's site, but
it seems to lists old products (which may still work OK).  The fact
that most only run under DOS (and not Windows) indicates that this
info is dated.  See
