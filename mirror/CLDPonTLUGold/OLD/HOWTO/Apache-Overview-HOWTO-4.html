<P>There are several ways of providing content with Apache.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Static</A>
</H2>

<P>Apache can serve static content, like HTML files, images, etc. 
If this is all you need, Apache is probably right for you.
A low end Pentium running Linux and Apache can easily saturate a 10Mbps
line serving static content. If that is your primary use of Apache, make
sure you also check the 
<A HREF="Apache-Overview-HOWTO-5.html#performance">performance</A> section.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Dynamic content</A>
</H2>

<P>For many websites, the information changes constantly and pages need to
be updated periodically or generated on the fly. This is what server side
programming is all about: programming languages, tools and frameworks that
help developers query and modify information from different sources (databases,
directory services, customer records, other websites) and deliver the content
to the user.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 CGI scripts</A>
</H2>

<P>CGI stands for Common Cateway Interface. CGI scripts are external programs
that are called when a user requests a certain page. The CGI receives information
from the web server (forms variable values, type of browser, IP
address of the client, etc) and uses that information to output a web page for the client.
<P><EM>Pros</EM>: Since it is an external program, it can be coded any
language and the same script will also be portable among different web
servers. The CGI protocol is simple, and the return result consists of writing
the response to the standard output. It is a mature technology, and there are
plenty of online and book references and examples. 
<P><EM>Cons</EM>: Spawning and initializing a process takes time. Since a CGI is
external to the server and an instance has to be launched/destroyed for every
request there is a performance hit. If the process has to load external
libraries or perform a connection to an external database the delay can be
important. Same thing if the number of hits per second is high. CGIs are
stateless and session management has to be achieved by external means.
<P>Since CGI usually involves heavy text manipulation, scripting languages are
the natural choice. Part of 
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</A> 
popularity stems from being the CGI programming language of choice. This is due 
to its extensive support for string handling and text processing. There are plenty
of freely available CGI scripts and libraries. A good starting point is:
<A HREF="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Internet/CGI/">the Open Directory CGI section</A><H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Site generators</A>
</H2>

<P>If your site is high volume, you may run into performance problems when
generating content dynamically. Offline content generators are an alternative.
These solutions separate content from presentation. The HTML
generator reads both sources and outputs the static files that build the
website. The generator can be run periodically or triggered by content
changes.
<P>Future versions of 
<A HREF="Apache-Overview-HOWTO-16.html#cocoon">Cocoon</A>
plan on having a batch mode to accomplish this. Another option is the 
<A HREF="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/wml/">Web site meta language</A>.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Out of process servers</A>
</H2>

<P>The web server can pass dynamic requests to another program. This program
sits idle until a request comes. The request is processed and returned to the
webserver which in turn returns it to the client. This eliminates the overhead
associated with CGI scripts. Examples of this approach are 
<A HREF="#fastcgi">Fast CGI</A>, 
<A HREF="#javaservlets">Java servlets</A>, etc.
<H2><A NAME="fastcgi"></A> <A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Fast CGI</A>
</H2>

<P>This standard was developed to address some shortcomings of the CGI
protocol. The main improvement is that a single spawned process can process
more than one request. There is an Apache module that implements the Fast CGI
protocol and libraries for Tcl, Perl etc. More information at

</H2>

<P>An external Java virtual machine processes requests. The JVM can reside in
the same computer or in a different one. This is how a lot of application
servers work. Usually standard libraries are included for server side
processing. You want to check

<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 Embeded interpreters</A>
</H2>

<P>An alternative to out-of-process webservers is to embed the interpreter in
the server itself. There are roughly two categories in this kind of modules:
Modules that answer or modify requests directly and modules aimed to process
commands embeded in HTML pages before serving it to the client. The most
representative approaches are
