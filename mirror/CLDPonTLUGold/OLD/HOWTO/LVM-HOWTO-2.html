<P>Historically, a partition size is static.  This requires a system installer
to have to consider not the question of "how much data will I store
on this partition", but rather "how much data will I *EVER* store on
this partition".  When a user runs out of space on a partition, they
either have to re-partition (which may involve an entire operating
system reload) or use kludges such as symbolic links.
<P>The notion that a partition was a sequential series of blocks on a
physical disc has since evolved.  Most Unix-like systems now have
the ability to break up physical discs into some number of units.
Storage units from multiple drives can be pooled into a "logical
volume", where they can be allocated to partitions.  Additionally,
units can be added or removed from partitions as space requirements
change.
<P>This is the basis of a Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
<P>For example, say that you have a 1GB disc and you create the "/home"
partition using 600MB.  Imagine that you run out of space and decide
that you need 1GB in "/home".  Using the old notion of partitions,
you'd have to have another drive at least 1GB in size.  You could then
add the disc, create a new /home, and copy the existing data over.
<P>However, with an LVM setup, you could simply add a 400MB (or larger)
disc, and add it's storage units to the "/home" partition.  Other
tools allow you to resize an existing file-system, so you simply
resize it to take advantage of the larger partition size and you're
back in business.
<P>As a very special treat, LVM can even make 'snapshots' of itself which
enable you to make backups of a non-moving target. We return to this
exciting possibility, which has lots of other real-world applications, later
on.
<P>In the next section we explain the basics of LVM, and the multitude of
abstractions it uses.
