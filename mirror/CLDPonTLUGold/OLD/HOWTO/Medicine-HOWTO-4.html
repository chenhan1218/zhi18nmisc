<P>
<A HREF="ftp:\\ftp.metalab.unc.edu\pub\Linux\apps\misc\">Nut</A> allows you to record what you eat and analyze your meals for nutrient composition. The database included is the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 13, which contains 6,210 foods.
<P>This database of food composition tables contains values for calories, protein, carbohydrates, fiber, total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and cholesterol; vitamins A, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, B6, folate, B12, C, and E; and minerals calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium, and zinc. Nutrient levels are expressed as a percentage of the <I>Daily Values</I>, the familiar standard of food labeling in the United States. In addition, levels of the omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are shown, along with average grams per day of the important PUFAs.
<P>You may search this list of foods and view nutrient values for different serving sizes; you may also rank foods in order of level of a particular nutrient. You may change the daily calorie level to correspond to your personal metabolism, and the levels for fat, carbohydrates, and fiber are automatically adjusted. You may add your own recipes to the database, by creating them from the foods in the database.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Bicycle Ride Calorie Calculator</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/6434/calcalc.html">Bicycle Ride Calorie Calculator</A> by Greg Kondrasuk is a simple program that calculates the number of calories expended on a bicycle ride. It is based on an article in the May 1989 issue of Bicycling Magazine, pp. 100-103. It provides a good estimate of the number of calories burned based on time, distance, rider weight, wind speed and direction, drafting, and climbing.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 weight</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A HREF="http://world.std.com/~damned/software.html">weight</A> is a GPL program, which helps users keep track of their weight. It computes a moving weighted average based upon daily weight (useful because it smooths the fluctuation of daily weights), can compute caloric debt, and can plot monthly, quarterly, annual, and other graphs of weight.
