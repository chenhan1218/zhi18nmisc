</H2>

<P> Often the serial driver is provided as a module.  Parameters may
be supplied to certain modules in /etc/modules.conf.  Since kernel 2.2
you don't edit this file but use the program update-modules to change
it.  The info that is used to update modules.conf is put in
/etc/modutils/.  The Debian/GNU Linux has a file here named
/etc/modutils/setserial which runs the serial script in /etc/init.d/
every time the serial module is loaded or unloaded.  When the serial
module is unloaded this script will save the state of the module in
/var/run/setserial.conf.  Then if the module loads again this saved
state is restored.  When the serial module first loads at boot-time,
there's nothing in /var/run/setserial.conf so the state is obtained
from /etc/serial.conf.  So there are two files that save the state.
Other distributions may do something similar.
<P>One may modify the serial driver by editing the source code.  Much of
the serial driver is found in the file serial.c.  For info
regarding writing of programs for the serial port see
Serial-Programming-HOWTO (revised in 1999 by Vern Hoxie but not at
LDP.  Get it from

<H2><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 Serial Console (console on the serial port)</A>
</H2>

<P> See the kernel documentation in: Documentation/serial-console.txt.
Kernel 2.4+ has better documentation.  See also "Serial Console" in
Text-Terminal-HOWTO.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.3">12.3 Line Drivers</A>
</H2>

<P> For a text terminal, the EIA-232 speeds are fast enough but the
usable cable length is often too short.  Balanced technology could
fix this.  The common method of obtaining balanced communication with
a text terminal is to install 2@ line drivers in the serial line to
convert unbalanced to balanced (and conversely).  They are a
specialty item and are expensive if purchased new.
<H2><A NAME="ss12.4">12.4 Known Defective Hardware </A>
</H2>

<H3><A NAME="8514_"></A> Avoiding IO Address Conflicts with Certain Video Boards </H3>

<P> The IO address of the IBM 8514 video board (and others) is
allegedly 0x?2e8 where ? is 2, 4, 8, or 9.  This may conflict (but
shouldn't if the serial port is well designed) with the IO address of
<CODE>ttyS3</CODE> at 0x02e8 if the serial port ignores the leading 0 hex
digit when it decodes the address (many do).  That is bad news if you
try to use <CODE>ttyS3</CODE> at this IO address.  Another story is that Linux
will not detect your internal modem on <CODE>ttyS3</CODE> but that you can use
<CODE>setserial</CODE> to put <CODE>ttyS3</CODE> at this address and the modem
will work fine.
<P>
<H3>Problem with AMD Elan SC400 CPU (PC-on-a-chip)</H3>

<P> This has a race condition between an interrupt and a status register
of the UART.  An interrupt is issued when the UART transmitter
finishes the transmission of a byte and the UART transmit buffer
becomes empty (waiting for the next byte).  But a status register of
the UART doesn't get updated fast enough to reflect this.  As a
result, the interrupt service routine rapidly checks and determines
(erroneously) that nothing has happened.  Thus no byte is sent to the
port to be transmitted and the UART transmitter waits in vain for a
byte that never arrives.  If the interrupt service routine had waited
just a bit longer before checking the status register, then it would
have been updated to reflect the true state and all would be OK.
<P>There is a proposal to fix this by patching the serial driver.  But
Should linux be patched to accommodate defective hardware, especially
if this patch may impair performance of good hardware?
