<H2><A NAME="s3">3. What LUGs are there?</A></H2>

<P>Since this document is meant as a guide not only to maintaining and
growing LUGs but also to founding them, it would be well before we go
much further to determine what LUGs there are.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Lists of LUGs</A>
</H2>

<P>There are several lists of LUGs available on the Web. If you want to
found a local LUG, one of the first things to do is to determine where
the nearest LUG is. <I>Your best bet may be to join a LUG that is
already established in your area rather than founding a new one.</I>
<P>As of the mid-1997, there are LUGs in all 50 states, the District of
Columbia, and 26 other countries, including India, Russia, and most of
Western and Eastern Europe. 
<P>Note: the biggest untapped computing market on the planet, China, does
not yet appear to have a LUG, and India, the second most populous
country on the planet, has only a few.

<P>It appears that the GLUE list is more comprehensive for American LUGs,
while the LUG List Project offers more comprehensive international
coverage.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Solidarity versus convenience</A>
</H2>

<P>While the lists of LUGs on the Web are well-maintained, it is likely
that they do not list every LUG. In addition to consulting these
lists, I suggest, if you are considering founding a LUG, that you post
a short message asking about the existence of a local LUG to 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.announce">comp.os.linux.announce</A>, 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.misc">comp.os.linux.misc</A>, or an
appropriate regional Usenet hierarchy. If there isn't a LUG already in
your area, then posting mesages to these groups will alert potential
members of your plans.
<P>If you plan to found a local LUG, you should carefully balance
convenience against solidarity. In other words, if there is a LUG in
your metropolitan area, but on the other side of the city, it may be
better to start a new group for the sake of convenience. But it may be
better to join the pre-existing group for the sake of unity and
solidarity. <B><I>Greater numbers almost always means greater power,
influence, and efficiency</I></B>. While it might be nice to have
two groups of 100 members each, there are certain advantages to one
group of 200 members. Of course if you live in a small town or
village, any group is better than no group at all.
<P>The point is that starting a LUG is an arduous undertaking, and one
that ought to be entered into with all the relevant facts, and with
some appreciation of the effect on other groups.
