<P> If you want to use a modem only for MS Windows/Dos, then you can
just install almost any modem and it will work OK.  With a Linux PC
it's not always this easy unless you use an external modem.  All
external modems should work OK (even if they are labeled "Plug and
Play")  But most new internal modems are Plug-and-Play (PnP) and have
PnP serial ports.  In some cases (depending both on the modem and your
version of Linux) The PnP configuring is built into the serial driver
so you don't need to do anything.  If it's an ISA modem you may need
to use the Linux "isapnp" program to configure it (but this is planned
to be built into future drivers ??).  See the Plug-and-Play-HOWTO and
the isapnp docs for more information.
<P>Since each modem has an associated serial port and the port has both
hardware and software, there are four parts to configuring a modem:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Configure the serial port PnP hardware: Done by PnP methods</LI>
<LI> Configure the serial port driver (low-level): Done by "setserial"</LI>
<LI> Configure the serial port driver (high-level): Done by the
communication program (stty-like)</LI>
<LI> Configure the modem itself: Done by the communication program</LI>
</UL>
<P>Communication programs include a<CODE>minicom</CODE>, <CODE>seyon</CODE>, or
<CODE>wvdial</CODE> (for PPP) and <CODE>mgetty</CODE>) for dial-in.  Such
communication programs require that you configure them although the
default configuration they come with may only need a little tweaking. 
<P>Unfortunately the communication program doesn't do the low-level PnP
configuring of the serial port: setting its IO address and IRQ in both
the hardware and the driver.  If you are lucky, this will happen
automatically when you boot Linux.  Setting these in the hardware was
formerly done by jumpers but today it's done by "Plug-and-Play"
software.
<P>But there's a serious problem: Linux (as of early 2001) is not a
true Plug-and-Play operating system but the latest serial drivers
handle Plug-and-Play for some serial posts (built-into internal
modems).   In other case you may need to use Plug-and-Play tools to
set up the configuration although they are not always very user
friendly.  This may create a difficult problem for you.  The next
section will go into this in much more detail.
