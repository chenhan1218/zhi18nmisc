                        </H2>

<P>Here are just a few of the snags that I've run into while using this
system. I put them here so that you can hopefully avoid them.  If you
run into any new ones, please 
<A HREF="mailto:matthew@shinythings.com">email them to me</A> so that I can keep track, and help others avoid
them.
<H3>read: I/O error                                </H3>

<P>This error apparently comes from pppd.  It's associated with mis-matched
versions off pppd.  If you get it, try upgrading both ends of the
connection to the latest version of pppd.  I've found that pppd version
2.2 has this problem, and use version 2.3.7 or 2.3.8 instead.
<H3>SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable                                </H3>

<P>This error is generated by <CODE>route</CODE>.  I've seen it happen when the
sleep time between <CODE>ssh</CODE> and <CODE>pppd</CODE> is not long enough. If
you get this error, run <CODE>ifconfig</CODE>, you may see that there is no
pppX interface.  This means that <CODE>ssh</CODE> was not done
authenticating before <CODE>pppd</CODE> was launched, and therefore
<CODE>pppd</CODE> did not make the connection.  just increase the delay, and
your problems will be solved.
<P>I wonder however if there might be some pppd option that will fix this
problem.
<H3><A NAME="ipv4forwarding"></A> IPv4 Forwarding and 2.2 kernels                                </H3>

<P>In the new 2.2 kernel, you must specifically enable IP forwarding in the
kernel at boot up.  This with the following command:
<P>
<PRE>
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</PRE>
<P>Without this, the kernel will not forward any packets, and hence the
server will not work, nor will any of the gatewaying clients.
<H3>Routing                                </H3>

<P>it should go without saying, but be careful when you are routing real numbers
that you don't route traffic destined for the VPN server's external address
through the tunnel.  It won't make it.  (yes, this <EM>is</EM> from personal
experience.)
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Hardware and Software Requirements</A>
                        </H2>

<H3>Minimum Hardware Requirements                                </H3>

<P>Believe it or not, this system has been run on a 486SX33 with 8
megabytes of RAM.  It didn't run very well though, it had trouble
handling heavy traffic.
<P>It doesn't take much more to make it work though.  This system does work
very well on a Pentium 75 with 16 megs of RAM, using an LRP distribution
running off of a floppy, with a 6 meg ramdisk, and 10 megs of main
memory. I've tested this setup by running a 700kbit RealVideo stream
through it for over an hour.
<P>I now typically run it on Pentium 90's, as their PCI clocking plays
nicer with cheap 100Mbit Ethernet cards.
<H3>Software Requirements                                </H3>

<P>This system works with both the 2.0 and 2.2 kernels.  The script to keep
the tunnel up requires a reasonably modern bash.  I have however noticed
that certain distribution's versions of bash don't play too well with
the script.
<P>Also, if someone could help me refine my scripts (or even write an
executable?) that would helps things a lot.  I'm not sure why, but even
my own bash doesn't follow the rules and doesn't seem to interpret
signals correctly.  If you do make any improvements, please email me at
