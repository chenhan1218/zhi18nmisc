<H2><A NAME="s9">9. PostgreSQL Supports Extremely Large Databases greater than 200 Gig</A></H2>

<P>PostgreSQL is already used by many companies supporting large databases.
The following techniques are suggested :
<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 CPU types - 32-bit or 64-bit</A>
</H2>

<P>Performance of 32-bit cpu machines will decline rapidly when the database size
exceeds 5 GigaByte. You can run 30 gig database on 32-bit cpu but the 
performance will be degraded. 
Machines with 32-bit cpu imposes a limitation of 2 GB on RAM, 2 GB on file system sizes
and other limitations on the operating system. Use the special filesystems for linux
made by SGI, IBM or HP or ext3-fs to support file-sizes greater
than 2 GB on 32-bit linux machines.
<P>For extremely large databases, it is strongly advised 
to use 64-bit machines like Digital Alpha cpu, Sun Ultra-sparc 64-bit cpu,
Silicon graphics 64-bit cpu, Intel Merced IA-64 cpu,
HPUX 64bit machines or IBM 64-bit machines. Compile PostgreSQL under 64-bit
cpu and it can support huge databases and large queries. Performance of 
PostgreSQL for queries on large tables and databases will be several times
faster than PostgreSQL on 32-bit cpu machines. Advantage of 64-bit machines
are that you get very large memory addressing space and the operating system 
can support very large file-systems, provide better performance with 
large databases, support much larger memory (RAM), have more capabilities etc..
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Multiple CPUs</A>
</H2>

<P>For large databases it is recommended that you use SMP boxes which have 4, 16 or
32 CPUs. Alternatively, you can use 4 or 5 single CPU boxes and you can 
partition the database into 4 or 5 seperate databases and each database running
on a seperate box. Each CPU will be connected with fast NIC (100MBits) ethernet card.
For example - if you have 200 tables in a database, you
can distribute 200 tables to 4 database each having 50 tables. 
In this way, you are distributing the load evenly among 4 seperate machines.
This is a cheaper alternative to 
4-way CPU box. You would use 
<B>'Queries across multiple databases'</B>,
NFS mounts in LAN,
'CREATE VIEW' for read-only tables
to accomplish this task. And each CPU "can see" all the databases i.e all the
200 tables.
In future PostgreSQL may provide support for <B>'Queries across multiple 
databases'</B> (already in the TODO list), which may appear in upcoming version 7.1.
For example, queries across multiple databases using aliases a, b for table names 
can be like -
<HR>
<PRE>
select a.col1, a.col2, b.col4, b.col7 
from
        database1.my_tablea a, database2.my_tableb b
where
        a.col1 = b.col3 and
        a.col4 = b.col9;

update my_tablea 
set
        col1 =  b.col2
from 
        database1.my_tablea a, database2.my_tableb b
where
        a.col4 = b.col9;
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Replication Server </A>
</H2>

<P>Replication server for large enterprises/businesses is 
available at 
<A HREF="http://www.erserver.com">http://www.erserver.com</A> and from 
<A HREF="http://www.pgsql.com">http://www.pgsql.com</A>.
The support is sold ($$$$s) commercially by
PostgreSQL Inc. You use replication server to provide redundancy and 
high availability. Replication server is a complex, sophisticated product.
