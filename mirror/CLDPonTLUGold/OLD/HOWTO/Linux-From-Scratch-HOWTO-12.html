<H2><A NAME="s12">12. Installing X Window System</A> </H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 Installing X</A>
 </H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the X archive and install it by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
make World
make install; make install.man
 
</PRE>
<P>During the compilation process you will encounter a few errors about the
"makedepend" script not being able to find the stddef.h stdarg.h and float.h
header files. The script just isn't as smart as the compiler is apparently,
since the compilation itself does work fine without compilation errors. Though,
creating a few temporary symlinks won't solve the problem; they only will cause
more problems.
<P>So you just ignore the many makedepend errors you most likely will be getting.
Also errors similar to "pointer targets in passing arg x of somefunction differ
in signedness". You can rewrite those files if you feel like it. I won't do
it.
<H2><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 Creating /etc/ld.so.conf</A>
 </H2>

<P>Create a new file <CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE> containing the following:
<P>
<PRE>
# Begin /etc/ld.so.conf
 
/lib
/usr/lib
/usr/X11R6/lib
 
# End /etc/ld.so.conf
 
</PRE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Update the dynamic loader cache by running <CODE>ldconfig</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.3">12.3 Creating the /usr/include/X11 symlink</A>
 </H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>In order for the pre-processor to find the X11/*.h files (which you encounter
in #include statements in source code) create the following symlink: <CODE>ln
-s /usr/X11R6/include/X11 /usr/include/X11</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.4">12.4 Creating the /usr/X11 symlink</A>
 </H2>

<P>Often software copies files to /usr/X11 so it doesn't have to know which
release of X you are using. This symlink hasn't been created by the X installation,
so we have to create it by ourselves.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create the /usr/X11 symlink by running <CODE>ln -s /usr/X11R6 /usr/X11</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.5">12.5 Adding /usr/X11/bin to the $PATH environment variable</A>
 </H2>

<P>There are a few ways to add the /usr/X11/bin path to the $PATH environment
variable. One way of doing so is the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create a new file <CODE>/root/.bashrc</CODE> with it's contents as follows: <EM>export PATH=$PATH:/usr/X11/bin</EM></LI>
</UL>
<P>You need to login again for this change to become effective. Or you can
update the path by running <CODE>export PATH=$PATH:/usr/X11/bin manually</CODE>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.6">12.6 Configuring X</A>
 </H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Configure the X server by running <CODE>xf86config</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>If the XF86Config file created by xf86config doesn't suffice, then you
better copy the already existing XF86Config from your normal Linux system to
/etc. Cases wherein you need to make special changes to the file which aren't
supported by the xf86config program force you to do this. You can always modify
the created XF86Config file by hand. This can be very time consuming, especially
if you don't quite remember what needs to be changed.
<H2><A NAME="ss12.7">12.7 Testing X</A>
 </H2>

<P>Now that X is properly configured it's time for our first test run. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Start the X server by running <CODE>startx</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>The X server should start and display 3 xterm's on your screen. If this
is true in your case, X is running fine.
<H2><A NAME="ss12.8">12.8 Installing Window Maker</A>
 </H2>

<P>I choose to install Window Maker as the Window Manager. This is because
I've used WindowMaker for quite a while now and I'm very satisfied with it.
As usual, you don't have to do what I'm doing; install whatever you want. As
you might know, you can install several Window Managers simultaneously and
choose which one to start by specifying it in the $HOME/.xinitrc (or
$HOME/.xsession in case you decide to use xdm) file.
<H2><A NAME="ss12.9">12.9 Preparing the system for the Window Maker installation</A>
 </H2>

<H3>Installing libPropList </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the libPropList archive and install it by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
./configure
make; make install
 
</PRE>
<H3>Installing libXpm </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the libXpm archive and install it by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
xmkmf; make Makefiles; make includes; make depend
cd lib; make; make install
cd ..; make; make install
 
</PRE>
<P>This slightly different installation is necessary due to a bug in one of
the Makefiles. It depends on files in the lib directory which aren't installed
yet and it's not searching for them in the lib directory, so we have to install
those files first before compiling the actual package.
<H3>Installing libpng </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the libpng archive and install it by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
make -f scripts/makefile.lnx; make -f scripts/makefile.lnx install
 
</PRE>
<H3>Installing libtiff </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the libtiff archive and install it by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>

<H3>Installing libjpeg </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the libjpeg archive and install it by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
./configure --enable-shared --enable-static
make; make install

<LI>Unpack the WindowMaker archive and install it by running:</LI>

<LI>Update the dynamic loader cache by running: <CODE>ldconfig</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.11">12.11 Configuring WindowMaker</A>
 </H2>

<P>Every user who wishes to use WindowMaker has to run the wmaker.inst script
before he or she can use it. This script will copy the necessary files into
the user's home directory and modify the $HOME/.xinitrc file (or create
it if it's not there yet).
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Setup WindowMaker for yourself by running <CODE>wmaker.inst</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.12">12.12 Testing WindowMaker</A>
