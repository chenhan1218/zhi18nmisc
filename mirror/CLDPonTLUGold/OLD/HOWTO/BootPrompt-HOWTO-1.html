<P>
<P>The kernel has a limited capability to accept information at
boot in the form of a `command line', similar to an argument
list you would give to a program. In general this is used to
supply the kernel with information about hardware parameters
that the kernel would not be able to determine on its own, or
to avoid/override the values that the kernel would otherwise
detect.
<P>However, if you just copy a kernel image directly to a floppy,
(e.g. <CODE> cp zImage /dev/fd0</CODE>) then
you are not given a chance to specify any arguments to that
kernel. So most Linux users will use software like <EM>LILO</EM>
or <EM>loadlin</EM> that takes care of handing these arguments
to the kernel, and then booting it.
<P>This present revision covers kernels up to and including v2.2.9.
Some features that are unique to development/testing kernels up 
to v2.3.2 are also documented.

Please see the Disclaimer and Copying information at the end

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Intended Audience and Applicability</A>
</H2>

<P>Most Linux users should never have to even look at this document.
Linux does an exceptionally good job at detecting most hardware and
picking reasonable default settings for most parameters.
The information in this document is aimed at users who might want
to change some of the default settings to optimize the kernel to
their particular machine, or to a user who has `rolled their own' 
kernel to support a not so common piece of hardware for which 
automatic detection is currently not available.
<P><EM>IMPORTANT NOTE:</EM> Driver related boot prompt arguments 
only apply to hardware drivers that are compiled directly into the
kernel. They have <EM>no effect</EM> on drivers that are loaded
as modules. Most Linux distributions come with a basic `bare-bones'
kernel, and the drivers are small modules that are loaded after
the kernel has initialized.
If you are unsure if you are using modules 
then look at <CODE>man depmod</CODE> and <CODE>man modprobe</CODE> along with the
contents of your <CODE>/etc/conf.modules</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Related Documentation</A>
</H2>

<P>The most up-to-date documentation will always be the kernel
source itself. Hold on! Don't get scared. You don't need to
know any programming to read the comments in the source files.
For example, if you were looking for what arguments could be
passed to the AHA1542 SCSI driver, then you would go to the
<CODE>linux/drivers/scsi</CODE> directory, and look at the
file <CODE>aha1542.c</CODE> -- and within the first 100 lines, you
would find a plain english description of the boot time arguments
that the 1542 driver accepts.
<P>The <CODE>linux</CODE> directory is usually found in <CODE>/usr/src/</CODE>
for most distributions.  All references in this document
to files that come with the kernel will have their pathname
abbreviated to start with <CODE>linux</CODE> - you will have to append the 
<CODE>/usr/src/</CODE> or whatever is appropriate for your system.
(If you can't find the file in question, then make use of 
the <CODE>find</CODE> and <CODE>locate</CODE> commands.)
<P>The next best thing will be any documentation files that are
distributed with the kernel itself. There are now quite a
few of these, and most of them can be found in the directory
<CODE>linux/Documentation</CODE> and subdirectories from there.
Sometimes there will be <CODE>README.foo</CODE> files that can be found
in the related driver directory (e.g. <CODE>linux/drivers/???/</CODE>,
where examples of <CODE>???</CODE> could be <CODE>scsi</CODE>, <CODE>char</CODE>, or <CODE>net</CODE>).
<P>If you have figured out what boot-args you intend to use, and
now want to know how to get that information to the kernel, then
look at the documentation that comes with the software that you
use to boot the kernel (e.g. LILO or loadlin). A brief overview
is given below, but it is no substitute for the documentation
that comes with the booting software.

<H2><A NAME="news"></A> <A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 The Linux Newsgroups</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have questions about passing boot arguments to the
kernel, please check this document first. If this and the
related documentation mentioned above does not answer your
question(s) then you can try the Linux newsgroups.
General questions on how to configure your system
should be directed to the comp.os.linux.setup newsgroup.
We ask that you <EM>please</EM> respect this general guideline
for content, and don't cross-post your request to other groups.
<P>Of course you should try checking the group before blindly
posting your question, as it may even be a Frequently Asked 
Question (a FAQ).
A quick browse of the Linux FAQ before posting is a <EM>good</EM>
idea. You should be able to find the FAQ somewhere close to
where you found this document.  If it is not a FAQ then
use newsgroup archives, such as those 
at <CODE>http://www.dejanews.com</CODE> to quickly search years
worth of postings for your topic. Chances are someone
else has already asked (and another person answered!) the question
that you now have.

</H2>

<P>New versions of this document can be retrieved via anonymous
FTP from most Linux FTP sites in the directory
<CODE>/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/</CODE>. Updates will be made as new 
information and/or drivers becomes available. If this copy that
you are presently reading is more than six months old, then
you should probably check to see if a newer copy exists.
I would recommend viewing this via a WWW browser or in the
Postscript/dvi format. Both of these contain cross-references
that are lost in a simple plain text version.
