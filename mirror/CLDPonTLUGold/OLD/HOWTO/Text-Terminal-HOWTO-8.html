<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Special Features of Some Terminals</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Color</A>
</H2>

<P> While the common monochrome terminal is not a color terminal it
may have a fixed "color" display other than white such as green or
amber.  All terminals have black (electron beam turned off = zero
brightness).  A real color terminal can change the color of the text
and background to many different colors while a monochrome terminal
can only change the brightness of a fixed color.
<P>However, changing the brightness, etc. gives a lot of possibilities.
For example, a black and white (monochrome) terminal can have white,
grey, and black by varying the brightness.  Some words can be black on
a light grey background while other are highlighted by black on white.
In addition there is white on black, underlining, and blinking.
<P>Color works like the color on a computer monitor or TV screen.
The CRT has three colors of dots on it with each color controlled by
its own electron beam (3 beams).  Monochrome has inherently better
resolution since it doesn't depend on dots permanently fixed on the
screen.  For text terminals the only use of color is to differentiate
text and this advantage is not always worth the cost of worse
resolution.  Thus monochrome may be better since it also costs less.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Multiple Sessions</A>
</H2>

<P> For dual sessions the terminal has two serial ports of equal
status.  Each port is connected to a serial port on a different
computer.  Thus one may log in to two different computers with each
session displaying in a split-screen window.   Alternatively, each
session may run full-screen with a "hot" key (or the like) to switch
between sessions.  One could also connect to two different serial
ports on the same computer and log in twice (similar to "virtual
terminals" at the console).  The program "screen" will make any
ordinary terminal (single session) connected to a single computer run
two or more "sessions".
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Printer/Auxiliary Port</A>
</H2>

<P> Many terminals have a connector on the rear for such a port.  It
may be labeled as "Aux" or "Printer", etc.  Some printer ports are for
parallel printers while others are for serial printers.  If a printer
is connected to the printer or auxiliary port, then pressing certain
keys will print the screen.  One may also have everything that
displays on the screen go also to the printer.  If the port is an
auxiliary port, one may connect this to another computer and almost
have dual sessions as above.  However, the video memory inside the
terminal may not retain both sessions so you may need to refresh the
screen when switching to the other session.  There will likely not be
a hot key either but possibly a programmable function key may be
programmed to do this.  There exists various key combinations and
escape sequences for controlling such a port.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-21.html#printer_esc">Printer Esc</A>.  
<P>There is a program called <CODE>vtprint</CODE> which is designed to send a
print job (text only) to your terminal to be printed on a printer
attached to the terminal.  It's homepage is <CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.yavin.org/software/vtprint/">http://www.yavin.org/software/vtprint/</A> </CODE>.  It's also
included (as of 1998) in the Debian distribution of Linux.  <CODE>xprt</CODE>
(also in Debian) seems to do something similar, but only for X-Window
terminals ??
<P>
<H2><A NAME="pages_"></A> <A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Pages </A>
</H2>

<P> Many terminals permit the storage of more than one page in their
video memory.  Sometimes the page size is the same as the screen, but
sometimes it is larger so that scrolling will reveal unseen parts of a
page.  So when one looks at a screen, there may be hidden text on the
same page above or below the display.  In addition, if there is more
than just one page, there may be hidden text on these other pages.
One use for pages is on terminals that support dual sessions.  Each
session may have its own page and one may switch back and forth
between them.
<P>Even if you only have a one-page-terminal with the page sized equal to
what is displayed on the screen, you will still see other pages of a
file (etc.) as the host sends more data to the terminal.  One
advantage to having additional pages stored in the terminal memory is
so that you can jump to them instantly without waiting a second or so
for them to be transmitted from the host.
<P>Multiple pages is supported by ncurses.  There is also a commercial
program called "Multiscreen" which supports multiple pages but
probably not for Linux ??  Multiscreen is reported to be part of SCO
and is something like the virtual terminals on a Linux PC console.
The Linux program "screen" makes it look like you have multiple pages
but they are stored in the computer and but you can have only one
page-like window for each running program.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="char_sets"></A> <A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 Character-Sets </A>
</H2>

<P> A character-set is normally represented by a list (or table or
chart) of characters along with the byte code assigned to each
character.  The codes for a byte range from 0 to 255 (00 to FF in
hexadecimal).  In MS-DOS, character-set tables are called "code-pages".
You should examine such a table if you're not familiar with them.
They are sometimes included in printer and terminal manuals but also
are found on the Internet.
<P>Many character sets include letters from foreign languages.  But they
may also include special characters used to draw boxes and other
special characters.  
<P>ASCII was the traditional English character set used on text terminals
It is a 7-bit code but will usually work OK even if your terminal is
set to 8-bit mode.  In 8-bit mode with ASCII, the high order bit is
always set to zero.  Other character-sets are usually available and
usually use 8-bit codes (except on very old terminals where the only
choice is ASCII).  The first half of most character-sets are the
conventional 128 ASCII characters and the second half (with the
high-order bit set to 1) belong to a wide variety of character-sets.
Character sets are often ISO standards.  To get specialized character
sets on a terminal, you may need to download a soft-font for that
character-set into the memory of the terminal.  Many terminals have a
number of built-in character sets (but perhaps not the one you need).
<P>Here are some common 8-bit character sets.  CP stands for Code Page
character sets invented by IBM: CP-437 (DOS ECS), ISO-8859-1
(Latin-1), CP-850 (Multilingual Latin 1 --not the same as ISO
Latin-1), CP-1252 (WinLatin1 = MS-ANSI).  MS Windows uses CP-1252
(WinLatin1) while the Internet often uses Latin-1.  There are several
ISO-8859- character sets in addition to Latin-1.  These include Greek
(-7), Arabic (-6), Eastern European (-2), and a replacement for
Latin-1 (-15) called Latin-9.  There are many others.  For example,
KOI8-R is more commonly used for Russian than IS0-8859-5.  Unicode is
a very large character-set where each character is represented by 2
bytes instead on just one byte.

<P>Once you've found the character set name (or alpha-numeric
designation) you are interested in, you may search for more info about
it on the Internet.
<P>
<H3>Graphics (Line Drawing, etc.)</H3>

<P> There are special characters for drawing boxes, etc.  There are
also numerous non-ASCII symbols such as bullets.   These may either be
part of an 8-bit character set (such as WinLatin1 = CP-1252) or
provided as a separate font (in vt100 terminals).  Your terminfo may
be set up to use them.  But if you see a row of letters when there
should be a line, it may mean that terminfo hasn't implemented them.
<P>You need to know the following if your graphics don't work right.
The default graphic character set is the vt-100 ANSI graphics.
Otherwise the string acsc must be defined in your terminfo.  It
establishes a map between the vt-100 graphic characters codes and the
actual codes used on your terminal.  So even if your terminal doesn't
have the vt-100 graphics, it can likely still generate such graphics
with some other character set.  If terminfo has it right, this will
happen automatically.
<P>If character sets must be switched then the terminfo variables: enacs,
rmacs, and smacs should be defined.  Note acs = Alternate Character
Set.  Even if the upper half of the normal character set contains the
graphic characters it may be considered a separate 7-bit character set
that needs to be switched to.
<P>
<H3>National Replacement Characters (obsolete)</H3>

<P> These result in modified 7-bit ASCII codes.   Many West-European
languages only need several additional letters which are not in ASCII.
To get them in 7-bit code, one may borrow the codes for seldom used
ASCII symbols:<BR> @  [  \  ]  ^  `  {  \  }  ~<BR>
The symbols $ and # are sometimes used also.   So when using these
replacement character sets, you are deprived of using certain ASCII
symbols since they now are used for the new non-ASCII letters.  Now
that 8-bit character codes have mostly replaced 7-bit ones, it's
better to use an 8-bit code which has both all the ASCII symbols plus
the non-ASCII characters for various languages.
<P>ISO-646 (for 1972 and later) permits this.  It specifies that the
above mentioned character codes may be borrowed, but doesn't specify
which national characters are to replace them.  Some countries
standardized the replacements by registering them with ECMA.
<P>Many terminals exist which support these national replacement
characters but you probably don't want to implement them unless you
have some old files to read.  Very old terminals may only support one
language (for the country in which they were sold).  Later terminals
offered a choice of languages.  Modem terminals are 8-bit and don't
need "national replacements".  Replacement characters exist for the
following languages/countries: British, Cuba (Spanish), Dutch,
Finnish, French, French Canadian, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian,
Norwegian/Danish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss (German).
<P>Here's tables for some character sets taken from Kermit and Unisys
documents:

<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Fonts</A>
</H2>

<P> Most terminals made after the mid 1980's can accept downloaded
soft-font.  This means that they can display almost any character set
provided that you can find the soft-font for it.  If you can't find
the needed soft-font, you can always create your own.  A free font
editor for this is called BitFontEdit (written by the author of this
document) and (in 1998) was at<BR>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7 Keyboards &amp; Special Keys</A>
</H2>

<P>Terminal keyboards often have a number of keys that one doesn't find
on a PC keyboard.  Few (if any) actual terminals will have all of
these keys and most will have additional keys not listed here.  Some
have a large number of special purpose keys such as terminals made for
use with cash registers.  There are often many more key meanings than
shown here since these keys often have extended meanings when used in
conjunction with other keys (such as shift and control).
<P>
<UL>
<LI> BREAK sends a very long 0 bit (space = +12 V) of duration 300
to 700 milliseconds to the host.  The host may interpret this as an
interrupt if stty has set brkint or ignore it if ignbrk is set.
</LI>
<LI> NO SCROLL stops the screen from scrolling like ^S does.
Depressing it again resumes scrolling.  Uses flow control signals to
do this.
</LI>
<LI> REPEAT if held down with an other key, forces repeated output of
that other key even if the auto-repeat option is set to off.
</LI>
<LI> LINE FEED sends the line feed character ^J to the host.  Seldom
used.
</LI>
<LI> SET-UP allows the manual configuration of the terminal via
menus.  Sometimes purposely disabled by putting a block under it so it
can't be pressed down.  Sometimes another key such as shift or control
must be pressed at the same time. See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-13.html#enter_setup">Getting Into Set-Up (Configuration) Mode</A>.
</LI>
<LI> LOCAL disconnects the terminal from the host.  In local, what
one types goes directly to the screen.  Useful for testing.
</LI>
<LI> RETURN is the same as the "enter" key on a PC.  It usually
sends a carriage return to the host which normally get translated to a
new-line character by the host's device driver.  On some terminals it
may be set up to send something else.
</LI>
<LI> F1, F2, ... or PF1, PF2, ... are function keys which usually
may be programmed to send out a sequence of bytes (characters).  See
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-13.html#funct_keys">Function Keys</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.8">8.8 Mouse</A>
</H2>

<P> A few text-terminals support a mouse.  When the mouse is clicked,
an escape sequence is sent to the host to tell it where the mouse is.
For a mouse on VT terminals see 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/dec_vt_mouse.html">http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/dec_vt_mouse.html</A> These
escape codes for mice are called "DEC Locator sequences".  Do any
linux applications support this ??  Which text-terminals have it ??
