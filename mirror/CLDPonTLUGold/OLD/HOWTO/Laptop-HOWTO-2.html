<P>Copyright &copy; 1999 by Werner Heuser. This document may be distributed under the terms set forth in the 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/COPYRIGHT.html">LDP license</A> .
<P>This is free documentation. It is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty. The information in this document is correct to the best of my knowledge, but there's a always a chance I've made some mistakes, so don't follow everything too blindly, especially if it seems wrong. Nothing here should have a detrimental effect on your computer, but just in case I take no responsibility for any damages incurred from the use of the information contained herein.
<P>Some laptop manufacturers don't like to see a broken laptop with an operating system other than the one shipped with it, and may reload MS-Windows if you complain of a hardware problem. They may even declare the warranty void. Though IMHO this isn't legal or at least not fair. Always have a backup of both the original configuration and your Linux installation if you have to get your laptop repaired.
<P>Though I hope trademarks will be superfluous sometimes (you may see what I mean at 
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">Open Source Definition</A>) : If certain words are trademarks, the context should make it clear to whom they belong. For example &quot;MS Windows NT&quot; implies that &quot;Windows NT&quot; belongs to Microsoft (MS). Mac is a trademark by Apple Computer. All trademarks belong to their respective owners.
