<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Fonts and Colors</A></H2>

<P>There are a lot of tricks to the fonts and colors used in X. They
are not quite as simple as in some other systems, for instance, the
font is not just a one-word name. You specify these resources quite
explicitly, and it seems rather complex at first, but with a little
explanation you'll be a whiz in no time.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Fonts Demystified</A>
</H2>

<P>The <EM>X Logical Font Description</EM> (``XLFD'') is the full name
for a
font. It consists of the following fields:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>fndry</CODE> - font foundry, the company or individual which
made
the font</LI>
<LI><CODE>fmly</CODE> - font family, the popular nickname of the font</LI>
<LI><CODE>wght</CODE> - font weight (bold, medium, etc.)</LI>
<LI><CODE>slant</CODE> - font slant (italics, oblique, roman (normal),
etc.)</LI>
<LI><CODE>sWdth</CODE> - font width (normal, condensed, extended, etc.)</LI>
<LI><CODE>adstyl</CODE> - additional style (sans serif, serif, etc.)</LI>
<LI><CODE>pxlsz</CODE> - pixel size, the number of pixels vertically in a
character</LI>
<LI><CODE>ptSz</CODE> - approximate point size of the text (similar to
pxlsz)</LI>
<LI><CODE>resx</CODE> - horizontal resolution, in dpi</LI>
<LI><CODE>resy</CODE> - vertical resolution, in dpi</LI>
<LI><CODE>spc</CODE> - spacing, only useful, apparently, in the
Schumacher fonts</LI>
<LI><CODE>avgWidth</CODE> - average character width of the font</LI>
<LI><CODE>rgstry</CODE> - the recognized registry that lists the font</LI>
<LI><CODE>encdng</CODE> - nationality encoding</LI>
</UL>
<P>In light of this chaos, the program <B>xfontsel</B> (the default X
Window font selection program) will come in enormously useful to you.
Try
launching it right now. You will see a strange nothing helpful in the
main window, but try holding the left button down on the <CODE>fndry</CODE>
button. If all your fonts are in order, you will see a menu of
selections
such as <CODE>adobe</CODE> and <CODE>b&amp;h</CODE> and <CODE>bitstream</CODE> and
so
forth. Select one such as <CODE>b&amp;h</CODE> and you will notice that the
font in the lower window changes to something intelligible. This is
generally the way you will select fonts with this program, starting
from
the left, which is the most general selection, and moving toward the
right, to the more specific options. Selecting an option toward the
rightmost end will not make much sense before the foundry, for
instance,
is selected, because the options are generally ordered by their
dependence on each other.
<P>When you go to select from the <CODE>fmly</CODE> selection, you will see
most
of the options greyed out, and only three remaining. That means that
these three are the only families of font made by this foundry. Some
families appear under more than one foundry, for instance, both
<EM>Adobe</EM> and <EM>Bitstream</EM> make a variation of the Courier
font. Now you can select the <CODE>wght</CODE>, and so forth. After you get
far enough you will have narrowed it down to the font that you want. 
You
don't necessarily have to fill in all the options to choose a single
font,
there's not <EM>that</EM> many fonts on your system! The options that
you
do not select will be represented by a <CODE>*</CODE> indicating that any
option will do in that spot.
<P>When you are happy with your font selection, you can hit the select
button, and your selection will be placed in the X clipboard, ready to
be
pasted into your document or whatever you are working on. For instance,
go to your <B>xterm</B> window and type in something like <CODE>xterm
-font </CODE> followed by an opening quotation mark. Then point to that
spot on your screen, and click your middle mouse button (or click both
the left and right, if you're middle-button impaired).  This will paste
the selection from the clipboard, which should be the font you just
selected. Then enter the closing quote, and hit <CODE>Enter</CODE>. For
instance, a nice big <B>xterm</B> with a Courier font specified would
look like this: <CODE>xterm -font
&quot;-adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*&quot;</CODE>
A fresh <B>xterm</B>
should the pop up using the font that you selected.
<P>The utility <B>xfd</B> is very helpful for examining a font.  If you
launch it with a command line such as <CODE>xfd -fn fixed</CODE>, it will
show you the character set for the font, much like the keycaps utility
on
a Macintosh.  Note that you can also limit the number of fonts that you
want <B>xfontsel</B> to display with the command line option
<EM>-pattern</EM>, followed by a quoted font specification, as
discussed
above.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Font Aliases and Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>Sometimes it gets tiresome to remember all of the long font names,
and
very impractical too. Luckily, it is not necessary to type in a hundred
keystrokes or so just to get the font name you want, for X provides
something called <EM>font aliases</EM>.
<P>If you look in the directory
<EM>/usr/X11R6/lib/fonts/misc/fonts.alias</EM>,
you will find shortcut names for many of the fonts. For example,
<CODE>8x16</CODE> is listed as a shortcut for
<CODE>-sony-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-120-100-100-c-80-iso8859-1</CODE>,
and
anywhere you enter <CODE>8x16</CODE> as an X font resource or at a command
line
for a font name, the long version of the font will be substituted.  The
<EM>75dpi</EM> and <EM>100dpi</EM> directories have similar aliases to
take
advantage of, on most systems the Lucida Sans font has a nice shortcut.
<P>If you add fonts or aliases to your system, you will have to issue a few
commands (probably as root).  If you add fonts, you will have to issue
the
following two commands (these are examples, you will have to put in the
correct directory, or perhaps leave it off altogether, to have your
fonts
re-read correctly.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 mkfontdir /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc
 xset fp rehash
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you change the alias file for a font, you may only have to issue the
last command above, but it may be a good idea to issue them both, to be
sure.
With the <B>xset</B> command you can explicitly issue a font path you
wish
the server to use, you can delete a specific directory from your font
path,
see the man page for more information.
<P>Another common problem is that some distributions (notably Red Hat
5.2, at the moment) come with the fonts configured in the wrong
order. If you take a look at your <EM>/etc/XF86Config</EM> (it may be 
somewhere else in some distributions, unfortunately, and I'm not sure 
where it is in Red Hat at the moment, so maybe <B>locate</B> it...)
Take a look at this file if your fonts are ugly in X (as in, very
difficult to read even at large sizes).  You will see a bunch of
entries that look something like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 FontPath   &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/&quot;
 FontPath   &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled&quot;
 FontPath   &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled&quot;
 FontPath   &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/&quot;
 FontPath   &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/&quot;
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The important thing to note here is that we have the unscaled
bitmapped fonts (the directories misc, 75dpi, 100dpi) before the
scaled fonts (such as Type1 and Speedo).  Bitmapped fonts are
preferred for the X Server, because scaled fonts don't look very
pretty for common use, they're better for things like The Gimp or
Netscape, perhaps.  You should also do a sanity check to see that
these directories all do, in fact exist, and if you have modified any 
lately, you might need to (as root) go in and issue an <CODE>mkfontdir
*</CODE> command in the <B>fonts</B> directory.
<P>Note that if you are running a more recent distribution, such as
one based on Red Hat 6.0 or later, you won't have to worry about this,
as the <EM>xttfs</EM> True Type font server is the default, and does
not use the path system to find your fonts.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Using Type 1 Fonts in X</A>
</H2>

<P>The font types X generally accepts are of limited use, considering
that about the only place you'll find fonts of that kind used are in
the
X Window System itself, and unfortunately most media junkies and
fontaholics work in operating systems that prefer other formats.
<B>Type 1 fonts</B>, most commonly used in conjunction with
PostScript
document formats, can be found for free on the internet with
considerable ease. Try 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/fonts/">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/fonts/</A>
for starters.
<P>To make use of these fonts is not that difficult, and graphics programs 
like <B>GIMP</B> will take advantage of them tremendously, and best 
of all, the Linux X servers understand Type 1 fonts ``out of the box.''
To use them, first unpack the archive using the appropriate commands, 
and put the fonts with a <CODE>.pfb</CODE> extension in 
<EM>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/type1/</EM> on your system. Then, add 
mention of those fonts in the <CODE>fonts.scale</CODE> file in that 
directory, using the format for the other fonts, already there. Then 
save the file.
<P>Now, you should be able to <CODE>mkfontdir</CODE> to tell the X server about 
the updates, and then run <CODE>xset fp rehash</CODE> to re-read the font 
path. If this doesn't work for you, you might have to restart X to see 
the changes.
<P>If you find yourself using Type 1 fonts a lot, and for things other than 
just X (GhostScript, for instance, can handle this font format as 
well), you'll want to check out the <B>type1inst</B> utility by James 
Macnicol. This program can configure Type 1 fonts for GhostScript and 
X, and it can also generate sample sheets for your fonts, and does most 
of the work of configuration for you. This program can usually be found 
at 
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/xutils/">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/xutils/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Using TrueType Fonts in X</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have been using an operating system such as Windows or the 
MacOS, you may have lots of fonts sitting on your computer already that
are <B>TrueType</B> fonts. TrueType fonts are considered best on
smaller,  low-resolution displays, such as your computer monitor, and
attempt to  provide nice features like shading and antialiasing, making 
your display look smoother. It is also really easy to find cheap 
TrueType fonts in bulk, and CD's featuring upwards of 500 fonts in the 
TrueType format are common in computer stores.
<P>X does not understand TrueType fonts, and has no innate capability (at 
present) to do so, and so it needs a separate program to do the 
<EM>font rendering</EM> for it.  There is a FreeType library to do 
this, but if you just want to use them on your computer, all you will 
need is a program called <B>xfstt</B>, the X font server for 
TrueType.  This program should be available at 
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/</A>.
<P>Installation is fairly straightforward.  Extract the archive, and 
<CODE>make</CODE> the file, and then <CODE>make install</CODE>. You may get a 
few errors that don't make sense after the second command; ignore them. 
What you need to do next is create a writable directory called 
<EM>/usr/ttfonts</EM> and put some of your <CODE>.ttf</CODE> fonts there, 
just to make sure it's going to work.  Then synchronize the font server 
with the command <CODE>xfstt --sync</CODE>.
<P>If you got no errors there, run the font server in the background with 
the command <CODE>xfstt &amp;</CODE> and tell your X11 server about the font 
service with the command <CODE>xset fp+ unix/:7100</CODE>.  If you got no 
errors, you should be able to run Netscape, the GIMP, even xfontsel, 
and have those fonts available to you. Your biggest problem may be 
finding the font you want, but that's not really a bad thing.
<P>It has been brought to my attention that more recent versions of
xset require a slightly modified version of this command, because of
changes in the code of xset.  If you are running a distribution based
on Red Hat 6.0 or later, or something equivalent, you will first want
to try <CODE>xset fp+ unix/:7101</CODE>.
<P>If everything seems to be working fine, at this point you will want to 
configure your system so that the fonts will be working when you start 
X.  If you are just starting X from the command line, this is easy.  
All you have to do is add the two commands from the previous paragraph 
to your <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> file, in that order.  When you next start X, 
it should work just fine.  If you are starting X via <B>xdm</B>, you 
will need to add <CODE>/usr/X11R6/bin/xfstt &amp;</CODE> to 
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0</CODE>. Got that? Then add <CODE>xset
fp+ unix/:7100</CODE> as well.
<P>Bear in mind that the installation of a TrueType font server can be 
tricky business. Remember that the order that you issue the above
commands is important. The font server must be started before X is
started, otherwise you will run into problems. Be sure to read 
the FAQ file that came with the distribution, and the <CODE>xfstt</CODE> 
man page too.  Many newer Linux versions come with this already working,
so see if that's not already the case before worrying too much about
it.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Colors</A>
</H2>

<P>Let's go back to our terminal window and try some more things. Try
opening an <B>xterm</B> with a command line like the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 xterm -fg darkslateblue -bg red3 &amp;
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>While that window may not be pretty, and you may not do much of your
best work in it, it demonstrates one interesting theme of X, the
names of the colors.  While not very precise, this is a nice way to
remember the colors more easily than remembering a series of
hexadecimal numbers. Note that color names are never case-sensitive.
<P>If you're interested in the gory details, or want to see the samples, or
even want to replace those silly color names with your own for some
strange reason, you can find the file listing all the colors with their
hexadecimal representation in <EM>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt</EM> on
your
system. There are also some extremely useful utilities with names like
<B>xcolorsel</B> and such. They can be found in the usual locations,
on
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/">http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/</A> and elsewhere.
<P>A more precise way of specifying colors is through the numerical
definition.  This consists of a color space name and a set of values
in the following syntax:
<P><EM>&lt;colorspace-name&gt;:&lt;value&gt;/.../&lt;value&gt;</EM>
<P>An RGB Device, which you will most likely be using, is specified with
the prefix &quot;rgb:&quot; and has the following syntax:
<P><EM>rgb:&lt;red&gt;/&lt;green&gt;/&lt;blue&gt;</EM> , where
&lt;color&gt; is a 1 to 4 digit hexadecimal number.
<P>As an example, you might represent the color <EM>red</EM> with
<CODE>rgb:ffff/0/0</CODE>. For backward compatibility, you can also
specify red with a syntax such as <CODE>#ff0000</CODE> or
<CODE>#ffff00000000</CODE>, and you will likely be seeing that
(older) syntax a lot.
