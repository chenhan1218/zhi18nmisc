<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Devfs (The new Device File System)</A>
</H2>

<P> This is a new type of device interface to Linix.  It's optional
starting with kernel 2.4.  It's more efficient than the conventional
interface and makes it easy to deal with a huge number of devices.
The device names have all changed as well.  But there's an option to
continue using the old names.  For a detailed description of it see:
<A HREF="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/devfs.html">http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/devfs.html</A><P>The name changes (if used) are: ttyS2 becomes tts/2 (Serial port),
tty3 becomes vc/3 (Virtual Console), ptyp1 becomes pty/m1 (PTY
master), ttyp2 becomes pty/s2 (PTY slave).  "tts" looks like a
directory which contains devices "files": 0, 1, 2, etc.  All of these
new names should still be in the /dev directory although optionally
one may put them elsewhere.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="dev_nos"></A> <A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Serial Port Device Names &amp; Numbers </A>
</H2>

<P> Devices in Linux have major and minor numbers (unless you use the
new devfs).  The serial port ttySx (x=0,1,2, etc.) has major number 4.
You may see this (and the minor numbers too) by typing: "ls -l ttyS*"
in the /dev directory.
<P>There formerly was an alternate name for each serial port.  For
example, ttyS2 would have cua2 as an alternate name.  You may still
have the cua devices in your /dev directory but they are now
deprecated.  Their drivers behave slightly different than for the ttyS
ones.  Device Obsolete">."') See the Modem-HOWTO
section: "cua Device Obsolete">.
<P>Dos/Windows use the COM name while the <CODE>setserial</CODE> program uses
tty00, tty01, etc.  Don't confuse these with dev/tty0, dev/tty1, etc.
which are used for the console (your PC monitor) but are not serial
ports.  The table below is for the "standard" case (but yours could be
different).

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Universal Serial Bus Ports</A>
</H2>

<P> Although the USB is not covered in this HOWTO, the serial ports on
the USB are: /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB1, etc.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Link ttySN to /dev/modem</A>
</H2>

<P> On some installations, two extra devices will be created, 
<CODE>/dev/modem</CODE> for your modem and <CODE>/dev/mouse</CODE> for a
mouse.  Both of these are symbolic links to the appropriate serial
device in <CODE>/dev</CODE> which you specified during the installation
Except if you have a bus mouse, then <CODE>/dev/mouse</CODE> will point to
the bus mouse device).
<P>Formerly the use of <CODE>/dev/modem</CODE> was discouraged since lock
files might not realize that it was really say <CODE>/dev/ttyS2</CODE>.
The newer lock file system doesn't fall into this trap so it's now OK
to use such links.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Which Connector on the Back of my PC is ttyS1, etc?</A>
</H2>

<H3>Inspect the connectors</H3>

<P> Inspecting the connectors may give some clues but is often not
definitive.  The serial connectors on the back side of a PC are
usually DB connectors with male pins.  9-pin is the most common but
some are 25-pin (especially older PCs like 486s).  There may be one
9-pin (perhaps ttyS0 ??) and one 25-pin (perhaps ttyS1 ??).  For two
9-pin ones the top one might be ttyS0.
<P>If you only have one serial port connector on the back of your PC,
this may be easy.  If you also have an internal modem, a program like
wvdial may be able to tell you what port it's on (unless it's a PnP
that hasn't been PnP configured yet).  A report from setserial (at
boot-time or run by you from the command line) should help you
identify the non-modem port.  
<P>If you have two serial connectors it may be more difficult.
First check manuals (if any) for your computer.  Look at the
connectors for meaningful labels.  You might even want to take off the
PC's cover and see if there are any meaningful labels on the card
where the internal ribbon cables plug in.  Labels (if any) are likely
to say something like "serial 1", "serial 2" or A, B.  Which com port it
actually is will depend on jumper or PnP settings (sometimes shown in
a CMOS setup menu).  But 1 or A are more likely to be ttyS0 with 2 or
B ttyS1.
<P>
<H3>Send bytes to the port</H3>

<P> Labels are not apt to be definitive so here's another method.  If
the serial ports have been configured correctly per setserial, then
you may send some bytes out a port and try to detect which connector
(if any) it's coming out of.  One way to send such a signal is to copy
a long text file to the port using a command like: cp my_file_name
/dev/ttyS1.  A voltmeter connected to the DTR pin (see Serial-HOWTO
for Pinout) will display positive as soon as you give the copy
command.
<P>The transmit pin should go from several volts negative to a voltage
fluctuating around zero after you start sending the bytes.  If it doesn't
(but the DTR went positive) then you've got the right port but it's
blocked from sending.  This may be due to a wrong IRQ, -clocal being
set, etc.  The command "<CODE>stty -F /dev/ttyS1 -a</CODE>" should show
clocal (and not -clocal).  If not, change it to clocal.
<P>Another test is to jumper the transmit and receive pins (pins 2 and 3
of either the 25-pin or 9-pin connector) of a test serial port.  Then
send something to each port (from the PCs keyboard) and see if it gets
sent back.  If it does it's likely the port with the jumper on it.
Then remove the jumper and verify that nothing gets sent back.  Note
that if "echo" is set (per stty) then a jumper creates an infinite
loop.  Bytes that pass thru the jumper go into the port and come right
back out of the other pin back to the jumper.  Then they go back in
and out again and again.  Whatever you send to the port repeats itself
forever (until you interrupt it by removing the jumper, etc.).  This
may be a good way to test it as the repeating test messages halt when
the jumper is removed.
<P>As a jumper you could use a mini (or micro) jumper cable and perhaps
use a scrap of paper to prevent the mini clips from accidentally
touching the metal of the connector.  Whatever you use as a jumper
take care not to bend or excessively scratch the pins.  To receive
something from a port, you can go to a virtual terminal (Alt-F2 for
example) and type something like "cp /dev/ttyS2 /dev/tty".  Then at
another virtual terminal you may send something to ttyS2 (or whatever)
by "echo test_message > /dev/ttyS2".  Then go back to the receive
virtual terminal and look for the test_message.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-13.html#ser_elect_test">Serial Electrical Test Equipment</A> for
more info.  
<P>
<H3>Connect a device to the connector</H3>

<P> Another way to try to identify a serial port is to connect some
physical serial device to it and see if it works.  But a problem here
is that it might not work because it's not configured right.  A serial
mouse might get detected if connected.
<P>
<H3>Missing connectors</H3>

<P> If the software shows that you have more serial ports than you
have connectors for (including an internal modem which counts as a
serial port) then you may have a serial port that has no connector.
Some motherboards come with a serial port with no cable or serial DB
connector.  Someone may build a PC from this and omit the connector.
There may be a "serial" label on the motherboard but no ribbon cable
connects to the pins next to this label.  To use this port you must
get a ribbon cable/connector.  I've seen different wiring arrangements
for such ribbon cables so beware.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="create_dev"></A> <A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Creating Devices In the /dev directory </A>
</H2>

<P>If you don't have a device "file" that you need, you will have to
create it with the <CODE>mknod</CODE> command or with the MAKEDEV shell
script.  Example, suppose you needed to create <CODE>ttyS0</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
linux# mknod -m 666 /dev/ttyS0 c 4 64
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You can use the <CODE>MAKEDEV</CODE> script, which lives in <CODE>/dev</CODE>.
See the man page for it.  This simplifies the making of devices.  For
example, if you needed to make the devices for <CODE>ttyS0</CODE> you
would type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
linux# cd /dev
linux# ./MAKEDEV ttyS0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This handles the devices creation and should set the correct permissions.
For making multiport devices see
