<P>Following are examples of the most common types of configurations. These
are guides only as there are as many ways of configuring your network as there
are networks to configure, but they may give you a start.

<H2><A NAME="ss21.1">21.1 Small Ethernet LAN with Linux as a router to Radio LAN</A>
</H2>

<P>Many of you may have small local area networks at home and want to
connect the machines on that network to your local radio LAN. This is
the type of configuration I use at home. I arranged to have a suitable
block of addresses allocated to me that I could capture in a single route
for convenience and I use these on my Ethernet LAN. Your local IP coordinator
will assist you in doing this if you want to try it as well. The addresses
for the Ethernet LAN form a subset of the radio LAN addresses. The following
configuration is the actual one for my linux router on my network at home:

<LI>You must have IP_FORWARDING enabled in your kernel.</LI>
<LI>The AX.25 configuration files are pretty much those used as examples
in the earlier sections, refer to those where necessary.</LI>
<LI>I've chosen to use an IP address for my radio port that is not within
my home network block. I needn't have done so, I could have easily used
<CODE>44.136.8.97</CODE> for that port too.</LI>
<LI><CODE>44.136.8.68</CODE> is my local IPIP encapsulated gateway and hence
is where I point my default route.</LI>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The use of the <EM>mss</EM> and <EM>window</EM> parameters means that I can
get optimum performance from both local Ethernet and radio based connections.</LI>
<LI>I also run my smail, http, ftp and other daemons on the router machine
so that it needs to be the only machine to provide others with facilities.</LI>

<P>Some points to note here are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The new tunnel driver uses the <EM>gw</EM> field in the routing table
in place of the <EM>pointopoint</EM> parameter to specify the address of
the remote IPIP gateway. This is why it now supports multiple routes per
interface.</LI>
<LI>You <B>can</B> configure two network devices with the same address.
In this example both the <CODE>sl0</CODE> and the <CODE>tunl0</CODE> devices have
been configured with the IP address of the radio port. This is done so that
the remote gateway sees the correct address from your gateway in encapsulated
datagrams sent to it.</LI>
<LI>The route commands used to specify the encapsulated routes can be
automatically generated by a modified version of the <EM>munge</EM> script.
This is included below. The route commands would then be written to a separate
file and read in using the <EM>bash</EM> <CODE>source /etc/ipip.routes</CODE>
command (assuming you called the file with the routing commands
<CODE>/etc/ipip.routes</CODE>) as illustrated. The source file must be in the
NOS route command format.</LI>
<LI>Note the use of the <EM>window</EM> argument on the <EM>route</EM>
command. Setting this parameter to an appropriate value improves the
performance of your radio link.</LI>

# From: Ron Atkinson &lt;n8fow@hamgate.cc.wayne.edu>
#
#  This script is basically the 'munge' script written by Bdale N3EUA
#  for the IPIP daemon and is modified by Ron Atkinson N8FOW. It's 
#  purpose is to convert a KA9Q NOS format gateways route file 
#  (usually called 'encap.txt') into a Linux routing table format
#  for the IP tunnel driver.               
#
#        Usage: Gateway file on stdin, Linux route format file on stdout.
#               eg.  tunnel-munge &lt; encap.txt > ampr-routes
#
# NOTE: Before you use this script be sure to check or change the 
#       following items:
#
#     1) Change the 'Local routes' and 'Misc user routes' sections
#        to routes that apply to your own area (remove mine please!)
#     2) On the fgrep line be sure to change the IP address to YOUR
#        gateway Internet address. Failure to do so will cause serious
#        routing loops.
#     3) The default interface name is 'tunl0'. Make sure this is
#        correct for your system.

<H2><A NAME="ss21.3">21.3 AXIP encapsulated gateway configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>Many Amateur Radio Internet gateways encapsulate AX.25, NetRom and Rose in
addition to tcp/ip. Encapsulation of AX.25 frames within IP datagrams is
described in RFC-1226 by Brian Kantor. Mike Westerhof wrote an implementation
of an AX.25 encapsulation daemon for unix in 1991. The ax25-utils package
includes a marginally enhanced version of it for Linux.
<P>An AXIP encapsulation program accepts AX.25 frames at one end, looks at the
destination AX.25 address to determine what IP address to send them to,
encapsulates them in a tcp/ip datagram and then transmits them to
the appropriate remote destination. It also accepts tcp/ip datagrams
that contain AX.25 frames, unwraps them and processes them as if it had
received them directly from an AX.25 port. To distinguish IP datagrams
containing AX.25 frames from other IP datagrams which don't, AXIP datagrams
are coded with a protocol id of 4 (or 94 which is now deprecated). This
process is described in RFC-1226.
<P>The <EM>ax25ipd</EM> program included in the ax25-utils package presents itself
as a program supporting a KISS interface across which you pass AX.25 frames,
and an interface into the tcp/ip protocols. It is configured with a single
configuration file called <CODE>/etc/ax25/ax25ipd.conf</CODE>.
<P>
<H3>AXIP configuration options.</H3>

<P>The <EM>ax25ipd</EM> program has two major modes of operation. "digipeater"
mode and "tnc" mode. In "tnc" mode the daemon is treated as though it
were a kiss TNC, you pass KISS encapsulated frames to it and it will
transmit them, this is the usual configuration. In "digipeater" mode, you
treat the daemon as though it were an AX.25 digipeater. There are subtle
differences between these modes.
<P>In the configuration file you configure "routes" or mappings between
destination AX.25 callsigns and the IP addresses of the hosts that you
want to send the AX.25 packets too. Each route has options which will be
explained later.
<P>Other options that are configured here are
<LI>the tty that the <EM>ax25ipd</EM> daemon will open and its speed (usually
one end of a pipe)</LI>
<LI>what callsign you want to use in "digipeater" mode</LI>
<LI>beacon interval and text</LI>
<LI>whether you want to encapsulate the AX.25 frames in IP datagrams or in
UDP/IP datagrams. Nearly all AXIP gateways use IP encapsulation, but some
gateways are behind firewalls that will not allow IP with the AXIP protocol id
to pass and are forced to use UDP/IP. Whatever you choose must match
what the tcp/ip host at the other end of the link is using.</LI>

<H3>Some notes about the routes and route flags</H3>

<P>The "<CODE>route</CODE>" command is where you specify where you want your AX.25
packets encapsulated and sent to. When the <EM>ax25ipd</EM> daemon receives
a packet from its interface, it compares the destination callsign with each
of the callsigns in its routing table. If if finds a match then the ax.25
packet is encapsulated in an IP datagram and then transmitted to the host
at the specified IP address.
<P>There are two flags you can add to any of the route commands in the
<CODE>ax25ipd.conf</CODE> file. The two flags are:
<DL>
<DT><B>b</B><DD><P>traffic with a destination address matching any of those on
the list defined by the "<CODE>broadcast</CODE>" keyword should be transmitted via
this route.
<DT><B>d</B><DD><P>any packets not matching any route should be transmitted via
this route.
</DL>
<P>The broadcast flag is very useful, as it enables informations that is normally
destined for all stations to a number of AXIP destinations. Normally axip
routes are point-to-point and unable to handle 'broadcast' packets.

<H2><A NAME="ss21.4">21.4 Linking NOS and Linux using a pipe device</A>
</H2>

<P>Many people like to run some version of NOS under Linux because it has
all of the features and facilities they are used to. Most of those people
would also like to have the NOS running on their machine capable of talking
to the Linux kernel so that they can offer some of the linux capabilities
to radio users via NOS.
<P>Brandon S. Allbery, KF8NH, contributed the following information to explain
how to interconnect the NOS running on a Linux machine with the kernel
code using the Linux pipe device.
<P>Since both Linux and NOS support the slip protocol it is possible to link
the two together by creating a slip link. You could do this by using two
serial ports with a loopback cable between them, but this would be slow
and costly. Linux provides a feature that many other Unix-like operating
systems provide called `pipes'. These are special pseudo devices that
look like a standard tty device to software but in fact loopback to another
pipe device. To use these pipes the first program must open the <B>master</B>
end of the pipe, and the open then the second program can open the
<B>slave</B> end of the pipe. When both ends are open the programs can
communicate with each other simply by writing characters to the pipes in the
way they would if they were terminal devices.
<P>To use this feature to connect the Linux Kernel and a copy of NOS, or some
other program you first must choose a pipe device to use. You can find one
by looking in your <CODE>/dev</CODE> directory. The master end of the pipes are
named: <CODE>ptyq[1-f]</CODE> and the slave end of the pipes are known as:
<CODE>ttyq[1-f]</CODE>. Remember they come in pairs, so if you select
<CODE>/dev/ptyqf</CODE> as your master end then you must use <CODE>/dev/ttyqf</CODE>
as the slave end.
<P>Once you have chosen a pipe device pair to use you should allocate the master
end to you linux kernel and the slave end to the NOS program, as the Linux
kernel starts first and the master end of the pipe must be opened first.
You must also remember that your Linux kernel must have a different IP address
to your NOS, so you will need to allocate a unique address for it if you
haven't already.
<P>You configure the pipe just as if it were a serial device, so to create
the slip link from your linux kernel you can use commands similar to the
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /sbin/slattach -s 38400 -p slip /dev/ptyqf &amp;
# /sbin/ifconfig sl0 broadcast 44.255.255.255 pointopoint 44.70.248.67 /
        mtu 1536 44.70.4.88
# /sbin/route add 44.70.248.67 sl0
# /sbin/route add -net 44.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 gw 44.70.248.67
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In this example the Linux kernel has been given IP address <CODE>44.70.4.88</CODE>
and the NOS program is using IP address <CODE>44.70.248.67</CODE>. The
<EM>route</EM> command in the last line simply tells your linux kernel to route
all datagrams for the amprnet via the slip link created by the
<EM>slattach</EM> command. Normally you would put these commands into your
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2</CODE> file after all your other network configuration
is complete so that the slip link is created automatically when you reboot.
Note: there is no advantage in using <EM>cslip</EM> instead of <EM>slip</EM>
as it actually reduces performance because the link is only a virtual
one and occurs fast enough that having to compress the headers first takes
longer than transmitting the uncompressed datagram.
<P>To configure the NOS end of the link you could try the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# you can call the interface anything you want; I use "linux" for convenience.
attach asy ttyqf - slip linux 1024 1024 38400
route addprivate 44.70.4.88 linux
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These commands will create a slip port named `linux' via the slave end of
the pipe device pair to your linux kernel, and a route to it to make it
work. When you have started NOS you should be able to ping and telnet to
your NOS from your Linux machine and vice versa. If not, double check that
you have made no mistakes especially that you have the addresses configured
properly and have the pipe devices around the right way.
