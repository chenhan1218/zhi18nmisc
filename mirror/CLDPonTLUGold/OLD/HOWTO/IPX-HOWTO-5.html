<H2><A NAME="s5">5. A brief discussion of IPX network topology</A></H2>

<P>This is a much simplified explanation for people new to IPX. Large networks
will probably break lots of the rules explained here. In complex IPX networks
the administrator should always be consulted.
<P>IPX networking revolves around a scheme of numbered <EM>networks</EM> unlike
IP which places more emphasis on the <EM>interface</EM> addresses. A network
is a collection of equipment connected to the same LAN segment and
<EM>using the same frame type</EM>. Different frame types on the same LAN segment
are treated as seperate networks.
<P>Each network must be allocated a number which is unique across the entire
internetwork. This is usually performed by a NetWare(tm) server, but can
easily be performed by Linux. IPX clients are given this number by the
server when starting, they only require to know the correct frame type.
<P>Routing between networks is usually performed by putting two network cards
in a server. This server then runs the RIP protocol which holds a routing
table for the internetwork. Periodic broadcasts of this routing table are
exchanged between servers. Within a short time each server 'discovers' the
topology of the internetwork.
<P>If you only wish to use the services of an existing NetWare server, you
can use <CODE>ipx_configure</CODE> (section 7.1) to automatically define the
IPX interfaces by using broadcast queries to look for a server. If this
fails, or you wish to provide IPX services, you will need to define the
interfaces manually using <CODE>ipx_interface</CODE> or <CODE>mars_nwe</CODE>.
