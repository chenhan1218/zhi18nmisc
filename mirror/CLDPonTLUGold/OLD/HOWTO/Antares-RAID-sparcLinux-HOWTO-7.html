<H2><A NAME="s7">7. 5070 Onboard Configuration</A></H2>

<P>
<P>Before diving into the RAID configuration I need to define a few terms.
<UL>
<LI>&quot;RaidRunner&quot; is the name given to the the 5070 controller board.</LI>
<LI>&quot;Husky&quot; is the name given to the shell which produces the &quot;:raid;&quot;
command prompt. It is a command language interpreter that executes commands
read from the standard input or from a file. Husky is a scaled down model of
Unix's Bourne shell (sh). One major difference is that husky has no concept
of current working directory. For more information on the husky shell and command
prompt see the &quot;Advanced Topics&quot; section</LI>
<LI>The &quot;host port&quot; is the SCSI ID assigned to the controller card
itself. This is usually ID 7.</LI>
<LI>A &quot;backend&quot; is a drive attached to the controller on a given
channel.</LI>
<LI>A &quot;rank&quot; is a collection of all the backends from each channel
with the same SCSI ID
(i.e. rank 0 would consist of all the drives with SCSI
ID 0 on each channel)</LI>
<LI>Each of the backends is identified by a three digit number where the first
digit is the channel, the second the SCSI ID of the drive, and the third the
LUN of the drive. The numbers are separated by a period. The identifier is
prefixed with a &quot;D&quot; if it is a disk or &quot;T&quot; if it is
a tape (e.g. D0.1.0). This scheme is referred to as &lt;device_type_c.s.l&gt;
in the following documentation.</LI>
<LI>A &quot;RAID set&quot; consists of given number of backends (there are
certain requirements which I'll come to later)</LI>
<LI>A &quot;spare&quot; is a drive which is unused until there is a failure
in one of the RAID drives. At that time the damaged drive is automatically
taken offline and replaced with the spare. The data is then reconstructed on
the spare and the RAID resumes normal operation. </LI>
<LI>Spares may either be &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;warm&quot; depending
on user configuration. Hot spares are spun up when the RAID is started, which
shortens the replacement time when a drive failure occurs. Warm spares are
spun up when needed, which saves wear on the drive.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The test based GUI can be started by typing &quot;agui&quot;
<PRE>
: raid; agui 
</PRE>
<P>at the husky prompt on the serial terminal (or emulator). 
<P>Agui is a simple ASCII based GUI that can be run on the RaidRunner console
port which enables one to configure the RaidRunner. The only argument agui
takes is the terminal type that is connected to the RaidRunner console. Current
supported terminals are dtterm, vt100 and xterm. The default is dtterm.
<P>Each agui screen is split into two areas, data and menu. The data area,
which generally uses all but the last line of the screen, displays the details
of the information under consideration. The menu area, which generally is the
bottom line of the screen, displays a strip menu with a title then list of
options or sub-menus. Each option has one character enclosed in square brackets
(e.g. [Q]uit) which is the character to type to select that option.
Each menu line allows you to refresh the screen data (in case another process
on the RaidRunner writes to the console). The refresh character may also be
used during data entry if the screen is overwritten. The refresh character
is either &lt;Control-l&gt; or &lt;Control-r&gt;.
<P>When agui starts, it reads the configuration of the RaidRunner and probes
for every possible backend. As it probes for each backend, it's &quot;name&quot;
is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen.
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Main Screen Options </A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>&lt;Figure 1: Main Screen&gt;</H3>

<P>
<P>The Main screen is the first screen displayed. It provides a summary of
the RaidRunner configuration. At the top is the RaidRunner model, version and
serial number. Next is a line displaying, for each controller, the SCSI ID's
for each host port (labeled A, B, C, etc) and total and currently available
amounts of memory. The next set of lines display the ranks of devices on the
RaidRunner. Each device follows the nomenclature of &lt;device_type_c.s.l&gt;
where device_type_ can be D for disk or T for tape, c is the internal channel
the device is attached to, s is the SCSI ID (Rank) of the device on that channel,
and l is the SCSI LUN of the device (typically 0).
<P>The next set of lines provide a summary of the Raid Sets configured on
the RaidRunner. The summary includes the raid set name, it's type, it's size,
the amount of cache allocated to it and a comma separated list of it's backends.
See rconf in the &quot;Advanced Topics&quot; section for a full description
of the above.
<P>Next are the spare devices configured. Each spare is named (device_type_c.s.l
format), followed by it's size (in 512-byte blocks), it's spin state (Hot or
Warm), it's controller allocation , and finally it's current status (Used/Unused,
Faulty/Working). If used, the raid set that uses it is nominated.
<P>At the bottom of the data area, the number of controllers, channels, ranks
and devices are displayed.
<P>The menu line allows one to quit agui or select further actions or sub-menus.

<H3>&lt;Figure 2: RAIDSet Configuration Screen&gt;</H3>

<P>
<P>The Raid Set Configuration screen displays a Raid Set in the data area
and provides a menu which allows you to Add, Delete, Modify, Install (changes)
and Scroll through all other raid sets (First, Last, Next and Previous). If
no raid sets have been configured, only the screen title and menu is displayed.
All attributes of the raid set are displayed. For information on each attribute
of the raid set, see the rconf command in the &quot;Advanced Topics&quot;
section. The menu line allows one to leave the Raid Set Configuration screen
or select further actions:
<UL>
<LI>[Q]uit: Exit the Raid Set Configuration screen and return to
the Main screen. If you have modified, deleted or added a raid set and have
not installed the changes you will be asked to confirm this. If you select
Yes to continue the exit, all changes made since the last install action will
be discarded.</LI>
<LI>[I]nst: This action installs (into the RaidRunner configuration
area) any changes that may have been made to raid sets, be that deletion, addition
or modification. If you exit prior to installing, all changes made since the
last installation will be discarded. The installation process takes time. It
is complete once the typed &quot;i&quot; character, is cleared from the menu
line.</LI>
<LI>[M]od: This action allows you to modify the displayed raid set.
You will be prompted for each Raid Set attribute that can be changed. The prompt
includes allowable options or formats required. If you don't wish to change
a particular attribute, then press the RETURN or TAB key. The attributes you
can change are the raid set name, I/O mode, status (Active to Inactive), bootmode,
spares usage, backend zone table usage, IO size (if raid set has never been
used - i.e. just added), cache size, I/O queues length, host interfaces and
additional stargd arguments. If you wish to change a single attribute then
use the RETURN or TAB key to skip all other options. The changed attribute
will be re-displayed as soon as you press the RETURN key. When specifying cache
size, you may suffix the number with 'm' or 'M' to indicate the number is in
Megabytes or with 'k' or 'K' to indicate the number is in Kilobytes. Note you
can only enter whole integer values. When specifying io size, you may suffix
the number with 'k' or 'K' to indicate the number is in Kilobytes. When you
enter data, it is checked for correctness and if incorrect, a message is displayed
and all changes are discarded and you will have to start again. Remember you
must install ([I]nst.) any changes.</LI>
<LI>[A]dd: When this option is selected you will be prompted for
various attributes of the new raid set. These attributes are the raid set name,
the raid set type, the initial host interface the raid set is to appear on
(in c.h.l format where c is the controller number, h is the host port (0, 1,
2 etc) and l is the SCSI LUN) and finally a list of backends. When backends
are to be entered, the screen displays a list of available backends, each with
a numeric index (commencing at 0). You select each backend by entering the
index and once complete enter q for Quit. As each backend index is entered,
it's backend name is displayed in a comma separated list. When you enter data,
it is checked for correctness and if incorrect, a message is displayed and
the addition will be ignored and you will have to start again. Once the backends
are complete, the newly created raid set will be displayed on the screen with
supplied and default attributes. You can then modify the raid set to change
other attributes. Remember you must install ([I]nst.) any new raid
sets.</LI>
<LI>[D]elete: This action will delete the currently displayed raid
set. If this raid set is Active, then you will not be allowed to delete it.
You will have to make it Inactive (via the [M]od. option) then delete
it. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion. Once you confirm the deletion,
the screen will be cleared and the next raid set will be displayed, if configured.
Remember you must install ([I]nst.) any changes.</LI>
<LI>[F]irst, [L]ast, [N]ext and [P]rev
allow you to scroll through the configured raid sets.</LI>

<P>
<H3>&lt;Figure 3: Host Port Configuration Screen&gt;</H3>

<P>
<P>The Host Port Configuration screen displays for each controller, each host
port (labelled A, B, C, etc for port number 0, 1, 2, etc) and the assigned
SCSI ID. If the RaidRunner you use, has external switches for host port SCSI
ID selection, you may only exit ([Q]uit) from this screen. If the
RaidRunner you use, does NOT have external switches for host port SCSI ID selection,
then you may modify (and hence install) the SCSI ID for any host port. The
menu line allows one to leave the Host Port Configuration screen or select
further actions (if NO external host):
<UL>
<LI>[Q]uit: Exit the Host Port Configuration screen and return to
the Main screen. If you have modified a host port SCSI ID assignment and have
not installed the changes you will be asked to confirm this. If you select
Yes to continue the exit, all changes made since the last install action will
be discarded.</LI>
<LI>[I]nstall: This action installs (into the RaidRunner configuration
area) any changes that may have been made to host port SCSI ID assign­ ments.
If you exit prior to installing, all changes made since the last installation
will be discarded. The installation process takes time. It is complete once
the typed &quot;i&quot; character, is cleared from the menu line.</LI>
<LI>[M]odify: This action allows you to modify the host port SCSI
ID assignments for each host port on each controller (if NO external host port
SCSI ID switches). You will be prompted for the SCSI ID for each host port.
You can enter either a SCSI ID (0 thru 15), the minus &quot;-&quot; character
to clear the SCSI ID assignment or RETURN to SKIP. As you enter data, it is
checked for correctness and if incorrect, a message will be printed although
previously correctly entered data will be retained. Remember you must install
([I]nst.) any changes.</LI>

<H3>&lt;Figure 4: Spare Device Configuration Screen&gt;</H3>

<P>
<P>The Spare Device Configuration screen displays all configured spare devices
in the data area and provides a menu which allows you to Add, Delete, Mod­
ify and Install (changes) spare devices. If no spare devices have been configured,
only the screen title and menu is displayed. Each spare device displayed, shows
it's name (in device_type_c.s.l format), it's size in 512-byte blocks, it's
spin status (Hot or Warm), it's controller allocation, finally it's current
status (Used/Unused, Faulty/Working). If used, the raid set that uses it is
nominated. For information on each attribute of a spare device, see the rconf
command in the &quot;Advanced Topics&quot; section. The menu line allows
one to leave the Spare Device Configuration screen or select further actions:
<UL>
<LI>[Q]uit: Exit the Spare Device Configuration screen and return
to the Main screen. If you have modified, deleted or added a spare device and
have not installed the changes you will be asked to confirm this. If you select
Yes to continue the exit, all changes made since the last install action will
be discarded.</LI>
<LI>[I]nstall: This action installs (into the RaidRunner configuration
area) any changes that may have been made to the spare devices, be that deletion,
addition or modification. If you exit prior to installing, all changes made
since the last installation will be discarded. The installation process takes
time. It is complete once the typed &quot;i&quot; character, is cleared from
the menu line.</LI>
<LI>[M]odify: This action allows you to modify the unused spare devices.
You will be prompted for each spare device attribute that can be changed. The
prompt includes allowable options or formats required. If you don't wish to
change a particular attribute, then press the RETURN key. The attributes you
can change are the new size (in 512-byte blocks), the spin state (H or hot
or W for Warm), and the controller allocation (A for any, 0 for controller
0, 1 for controller 1, etc). If you wish to change a single attribute of a
spare device, then use the RETURN key to skip all other attributes for each
spare device. The changed attribute will not be re-displayed until the last
prompted attribute is entered (or skipped). When you enter data, it is checked
for cor­ rectness and if incorrect, a message is dis­ played and all changes
are discarded and you will have to start again. Remember you must install ([I]nstall)
any changes.</LI>
<LI>[A]dd: When adding a spare device, the list of available devices
is displayed and you are required to type in the device name. Once entered,
the spare is added with defaults which you can change, if required, via the
[M]odify option. Remember you must install ([I]nstall)
any changes.</LI>
<LI>[D]elete: When deleting a spare device, the list of spare devices
allowed to be deleted is displayed and you are required to type in the required

<P>The generalized procedure for configuration consists of three steps arranged
in the following order:
<OL>
<LI>Configuring the Host Port(s) </LI>
<LI>Assigning Spares</LI>
<LI>Configuring the RAID set</LI>
</OL>
<P>Note that there is a minimum number of backends required for the various

<LI>Level 0 : 2 backends</LI>
<LI>Level 3 : 2 backends</LI>
<LI>Level 5 : 3 backends</LI>
</UL>
<P>In this example we will configure a RAID 5 using 6, 2.04 gigabyte drives.
The total capacity of the virtual drive will be 10 gigabytes (the equivalent
of one drive is used for redundancy). This same configuration procedure can
be used to configure other levels of RAID sets by changing the type parameter.
<OL>
<LI>Power on the computer with the serial terminal connected to the RaidRunner's

<LI>On some models of RaidRunner the host port in not configurable. If you
have only a [Q]uit option here then there is nothing further to be
done for the host port configuration, note the values and skip to step 6. If
you have add/modify options then your host port is software configurable. </LI>
<LI>If there is no entry for a host port on this screen, add an entry with
