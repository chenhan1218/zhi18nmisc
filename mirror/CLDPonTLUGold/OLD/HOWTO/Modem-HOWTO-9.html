<P> For creating devices in the device directory see:
the Serial-HOWTO: "Creating Devices In the /dev directory".

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Devfs (The new Device File System)</A>
</H2>

<P> This is a new type of device interface to Linix.  It's optional
starting with kernel 2.4.  It's more efficient than the conventional
interface and makes it easy to deal with a huge number of devices.
The device names have all changed as well.  But there's an option to
continue using the old names.  For a detailed description of it see:
<A HREF="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/devfs.html">http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/devfs.html</A><P>The name changes (if used) are: ttyS2 becomes tts/2 (Serial port),
tty3 becomes vc/3 (Virtual Console), ptyp1 becomes pty/m1 (PTY
master), ttyp2 becomes pty/s2 (PTY slave).  "tts" looks like a
directory which contains devices "files": 0, 1, 2, etc.  All of these
new names should still be in the /dev directory although optionally
one may put them elsewhere.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="dev_nos"></A> <A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Serial Port Device Names &amp; Numbers </A>
</H2>

<P> Devices in Linux have major and minor numbers (unless you use the
new devfs).  The serial port ttySx (x=0,1,2, etc.) has major number 4.
You may see this (and the minor numbers too) by typing: "ls -l ttyS*"
in the /dev directory.
<P>There formerly was an alternate name for each serial port.  For
example, ttyS2 would have cua2 as an alternate name.  You may still
have the cua devices in your /dev directory but they are now
deprecated.  Their drivers behave slightly different than for the ttyS
ones.  Device Obsolete">."') 
<P>Dos/Windows use the COM name while the <CODE>setserial</CODE> program uses
tty00, tty01, etc.  Don't confuse these with dev/tty0, dev/tty1, etc.
which are used for the console (your PC monitor) but are not serial
ports.  The table below is for the "standard" case (but yours could be
different).

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Universal Serial Bus Ports</A>
</H2>

<P> Although the USB is not covered in this HOWTO, the serial ports on
the USB are: /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB1, etc.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Link ttySN to /dev/modem</A>
</H2>

<P> On some installations, two extra devices will be created, 
<CODE>/dev/modem</CODE> for your modem and <CODE>/dev/mouse</CODE> for a
mouse.  Both of these are symbolic links to the appropriate serial
device in <CODE>/dev</CODE> which you specified during the installation
Except if you have a bus mouse, then <CODE>/dev/mouse</CODE> will point to
the bus mouse device).
<P>Formerly the use of <CODE>/dev/modem</CODE> was discouraged since lock
files might not realize that it was really say <CODE>/dev/ttyS2</CODE>.
The newer lock file system doesn't fall into this trap so it's now OK
to use such links.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="cua_dev"></A> <A NAME="ss9.5">9.5 cua Device Obsolete </A>
</H2>

<P> Each ttyS device has a corresponding cua device.  But the cua
device is deprecated so it's best to use ttyS (unless cua is
required).  There is a difference between cua and ttyS but a savvy
programmer can make a ttyS port behave just like a cua port so there
is no real need for the cua anymore.  Except that some older programs
may need to use the cua.
<P>What's the difference?  The main difference between cua and ttyS has
to do with what happens in a C-program when an ordinary "open" command
tries to open the port. If a cua port has been set to check modem
control signals, the port can be opened even if the CD modem control
signal says not to.  Astute programming (by adding additional lines to
the program) can force a ttyS port to behave this way also.  But a cua
port can be more easily programmed to open for dialing out on a modem
even when the modem fails to assert CD (since no one has called into
it and there's no carrier).  That's why cua was once used for dial-out
and ttyS used for dial-in.
<P>Starting with Linux kernel 2.2, a warning message is put in the
kernel log when one uses cua.  This is an omen that cua is defunct and
should be avoided if possible.
