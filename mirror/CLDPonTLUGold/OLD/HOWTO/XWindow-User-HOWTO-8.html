<H2><A NAME="s8">8. The X Resources</A></H2>

<P>We will at this point consider some finer modifications to your
system. Configuring the window manager only gets you so far. The window
manager lets you customize everything that happens <EM>outside</EM> the
windows, the frames, the borders, the buttons, the desktop... but what
about making the <EM>inside</EM> of the windows pretty? The only way to
do
this is by modifying the <EM>X Resources</EM> for your system.
<P>X Resources provide a mechanism for storing default values for program
resources and tailoring your windowing environment to your favored
look and feel. Resources are specified as text strings that are read
in from various places when an application is run. Program components
are named in a hierarchical fashion, with each object in the
hierarchy identified by a class as well as an instance name. At the
top level of the hierarchy is the class and instance name of the
application itself. By convention, the class name of the application
is the same as the program name, but with the first letter
capitalized (e.g.  Bitmap or Emacs) although some programs that begin
with the letter ``X'' also capitalize the second letter for
historical reasons (e.g. XTerm).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 X Resources: The Basics</A>
</H2>

<P>Let's try a few examples to ease you into the world of
resources. Start by opening an xterm window. Most likely you have one
open already, can open one with a menu selection, or may wish to
backtrack a bit in this document to get your bearings! Type something
like this into the xterm window:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 xterm -background blue &amp;
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This command should have resulted in another xterm window popping up
on your screen, but this time with a blue background. ``Wow,'' you say,
``that's amazing!'' Yes, indeed it is.
<P>We'll need a little more background for our next example. Type exit in
that xterm (which will close that window) and go back to the original
window that you typed that command in. Try this: hold the Ctrl key
and then hold the left mouse button. Now try that with the middle
mouse button. Now the right.  All xterm windows give you options to
try while they are running. With the right button, for instance, you
can change the font of the window. Notice the color of these
menus. Now try this example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 xterm -xrm 'xterm*fontMenu*background: green' &amp;
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This time, it just looks like a normal xterm window. But if you try
holding Ctrl and the right mouse button in that window, you will see
that
this menu (the ``fontMenu'' mentioned in the above example) is green.
What
just happened?  If you look at the man page for <B>xterm</B>, you
will
see many command-line options, such as <EM>-background</EM> or
<EM>-font</EM>, that you can set when you launch any given window in X,
listed after the options just for <B>xterm</B> windows. These
particular options are called <EM>X Toolkit Options</EM>, and they
apply
to just about anything in X.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Inside The X Resource Database With <EM>editres</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>To really get inside the resources of X, we need to run
<B>editres</B>. Go ahead
and launch it (and a sample program to play with) now:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 xclock &amp;
 editres &amp;
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Probably you will see a simple clock, and the rather innocent looking,
mostly-blank window of <B>editres</B>.  The main window is showing us
the resource tree of any given window on our desktop, and upon program
launch, there is none. So let's give it one. Hold down the left button
on
the Commands menu, and select Get Tree. In the top of the window will
appear <CODE>Click the mouse pointer on any toolkit client</CODE>. This
message is more than it seems, and it is a hint to us that not all X
applications are toolkit clients (though most of the basic ones are,
and
the program will usually tell us if it is not in the manual page). The
mouse cursor will turn to a crosshair, and wait for you to click on
another window.
<P>For this example, let's first click on the <B>xclock</B>. You will
see a couple things appear in the <B>editres</B> window. These are
the configurable branches that the toolkit sees. Click on the bottom
right one (clock). It should invert.  Now select ``Show Resource Box''
from the ``Commands'' menu. You will see another window pop up, with
the heading &quot;.xclock.clock.unknown&quot;. Bingo!
<P>>From here you can toy with the configuration options of the main
<B>xclock</B> window. First, click on ``Set Save File'' at the
bottom, and put in a filename such as
<EM>/home/yourname/resources</EM>, to indicate that you're testing
some of the resources here. Now click on ``foreground'' and put in
``blue'' next to the ``Enter Resource Value:'' prompt. Then hit
``Apply''
at the bottom. The minute notches around the clock should turn
blue. Go to ``background'' and enter ``navajowhite'' (or whatever color
you prefer). Then apply that. As you can see, we can configure the
whole window just fine this way. But if you were to try launching
another <B>xclock</B>, it would appear just as this one appeared
before any changes. We need to save these changes.
<P>Click ``Save'' and then ``Popdown Resource Box'' (a fancy name indeed
for
the ``Close'' function!). If you view the file you just created
(<EM>cat /home/yourname/resources</EM> perhaps) you will see all
those resources spelled out, in correct X Toolkit format, for your
convenience. But that does us little good, for if you try launching
another <B>xclock</B>, it will still look Plain Jane. So here is
the last and final step in loading in your resources:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 xrdb -merge /home/yourname/resources
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This command <EM>merges</EM> the resources we just wrote into the <EM>X
Resource Database</EM> (<B>xrdb</B>) for your session of X Window.
That
means that for all future invocations of the X applications we
modified,
our changes will take place, and remain binding. So if you run another
<B>xclock</B>, it will look as nice as you have just now set it up,
every time you run it. Mind you, <B>xrdb</B> is a complex program,
and
you may want to have a look at the man page before moving on, or
playing
around with it some more. If you added the modification to
<CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> listed earlier in this document, to load the
resources
automatically on X startup, you should only have to worry about the
<B>xrdb</B> command when you make changes during your X session.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 The Anatomy of X Resources</A>
</H2>

<P>As you can see we have stumbled across a plethora of configuration
options here. This method of configuring X, as has been stated,
offers nearly limitless possibilities, and an equivalent amount of
confusion. To get some picture of the scope of the resources in just
the X Toolkit Intrinsics alone, run the program <B>viewres</B>, and
play around with it a bit. This program graphically displays the tree
of resources in the <EM>Xt Library</EM>.
<P>If you read the manual page for <B>X</B>, you will find a rather
obscure definition of the exact syntax for defining resources it
understands. We can simplify this quite a bit and break it down into
this essential syntax definition:
<P><EM>&lt;program&gt;&lt;binding&gt;&lt;widget&gt;&lt;binding&gt;&lt;widget&gt;&lt;...&gt;&lt;resource&gt;:&lt;value&gt;</EM>
<P>That doesn't really seem that simple, actually. Well, let's define
some things about what has just been said, and it will all start to
make sense after all. You can peek ahead to the examples in the next
section as you read along, if you wish.
<P>The <EM>program</EM> in this definition is the invocation of an
application in the resource database. This would be <CODE>XTerm</CODE>
for an invocation of <B>xterm</B>, <CODE>emacs</CODE> for an invocation
of the <B>emacs</B> text editor, or a user-defined name that was
given when the applications was launched with the <B>-name</B>
command line option. In this way you can define separate resources
for <B>xterm</B>s which will be used in different ways. Which is
pretty cool, really.
<P>The <EM>binding</EM> can be one of two characters to separate the
widgets and such.  If you use a <CODE>.</CODE> (period), you get a
<EM>tight binding</EM>, which means that one widget is directly above
or below the other in the widget hierarchy. This also has the highest
precedence of the specification methods. If you use a <CODE>*</CODE>
(asterisk), you get a so-called <EM>loose binding</EM>, and you will
skip any number of widgets in the hierarchy, and it will attempt to
match the next possible widget defined.
<P>The <EM>widget</EM> entries are items in the widget tree, in order of
most-specific to least-specific, that they appear in the widget tree,
visible with <B>editres</B>.  Any single widget entry can also be
replaced with a <CODE>?</CODE> (question mark) to skip a single widget
definition, and match any possible widget item.
<P>The <EM>resource</EM> item must be specified, and cannot be replaced
with
the <CODE>?</CODE> character. This is the most-specific item in the
hierarchy, and usually contains items like the actual color to define,
actual font to define, and so forth.  In fact, everything else before
the
resource in this definition can be left out and replaced with a single
asterisk, but the actual resource to define must be present. If you
just
put an asterisk and the most-specific resource name, such as
<CODE>*background: blue</CODE>, X will attempt to define that resource
globally, for all its clients, if possible.
<P>Following the colon is the <EM>value</EM> entry. This entry defines
what the resource will be set to, such as a font name or color
value. The value can be specified (depending on context) as a
boolean, numeric, or text data type. The value entry, also, cannot be
omitted in a valid resource definition.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Making Your Changes Last With <EM>.Xdefaults</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>There is a magic file you can put in your home directory called
<EM>.Xdefaults</EM>. If you copy the lines in the resources file from
the
last example into the <EM>.Xdefaults</EM> in your home directory, you
will never have to configure <B>xclock</B> again! While this might
not
be the finest example of its utility, it makes its point. This file can
be crammed full of every option you prefer for every type of program
you
run in X, and if you take proper care of it, you can still easily go
back
and make slight changes when you need to. But making lots of changes,
and
hunting down lots of subtle resources using <B>editres</B> can be an
extremely tiring and painstaking procedure. Indeed, sometimes that's
too
much work, and most of these resources are already waiting for you,
neat
and orderly, grouped by program, on your system.
<P>In the directory <EM>/var/X11R6/lib/app-defaults</EM> you will find a
great many files, all named after an X Toolkit program. If you
examine these files you will find that they contain a great many
configuration options for each one, and I do mean a great many! You
would not want all of these options from all of these files in your
<EM>.Xdefaults</EM> file, that would be quite tiresome to deal
with. These are the defaults, and it is from these that you can
decide what you would like to see changed for your particular
configuration.
<P>The following are some samples from my <EM>.Xdefaults</EM> file. Notice
a
few things we have not yet mentioned about the resource definition
files. If a line begins with <CODE>!</CODE> (exclamation point), it is
considered a comment, and the rest of the line is ignored. If the line
begins with <CODE>#include <EM>filename</EM></CODE>, that line is an
<EM>include directive</EM>, and at that point in the resources another
file will be merged, when it is loaded. This can help keep your
resource
files from becoming too bloated. And here are some examples:

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>One word of warning with regard to X resources, for KDE users.  There's
a
setting in the control panel which will cause all your X Resources to
be
overwritten in your applications. This can be a really nice feature,
but
it can also be an annoyance if you have painstakingly configured your
resources.  Open the control panel and find the ``Fonts etc.''
section.  There's an option to ``Apply style to non-KDE apps''.  If you
turn this on, all your programs will adopt the look and feel configured
by KDE (you may need to restart X to notice this).  If you leave this
option turned off, your resources will remain as you have configured
them.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 Your Own User Resource Directory</A>
</H2>

<P>You can also create a directory of resource files, just like the
system-wide <EM>app-defaults</EM> directory mentioned above, with one
file
per program. Just create the directory (for our example we'll use
app-defaults under your home directory,) and then set the environment
variable <CODE>XAPPLRESDIR</CODE> to point to it. A good place to set this
variable would be in the beginning of your <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> file, for
example, put in the line <CODE>export XAPPLRESDIR=$HOME/app-defaults</CODE>
(if
your files are going to be in an <EM>app-defaults</EM> directory under
your
home directory).
<P>Now, whenever you start an X program, this directory will be searched
for
a file with the same name as the resource name of the program, just
like
the system-wide directory.  This is the <EM>client name</EM> that you
used in <CODE>.Xdefaults</CODE> files.
<P>For example, a file called <EM>XTerm</EM> could contain the line
<CODE>*background: gold</CODE>, and all your <B>xterm</B>s would, by
default,
come up with a gold background. This is a nice alternative to a single
<CODE>.Xdefaults</CODE> file, and makes it more clear when trying to decide
which settings to configure later on, and to find the ones for a
certain
program. There are still uses for the <CODE>.Xdefaults</CODE>, though. 
It's
useful for setting resources not bound to a single program, like
modifications that you would make to turn all of a certain kind of
button
blue, regardless of the application.
