<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Practical suggestions</A></H2>

<P>Finally, I want to make some very practical, even mundane, suggestions
for anyone wanting to found, maintain, or grow a LUG.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 LUG support organizations</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are several organizations that offer assistance to local LUGs.
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>GLUE</B><DD><P>Groups of Linux Users Everywhere is a user group
coordination and support program started by SSC, the same people who
publish <I>Linux Journal</I>. The 
<A HREF="http://www.ssc.com/glue/">GLUE program</A> is an inexpensive way for a local
LUG to provide some benefits to its membership.
<P>
<DT><B>Linux Systems Labs</B><DD><P>
<A HREF="http://www.lsl.com/">LSL</A> offers their Tri-Linux Disk set (Three
Linux distributions on four CDs: Red Hat, Slackware, and Debian) to
LUGs for resale at a considerable discount.
<P>
<DT><B>Linux Mall User Group Program</B><DD><P>Sponsored by WorkGroup
Solutions, the 
<A HREF="http://www.LinuxMall.com/usergrp.program.html">Linux Mall User Group Program</A> offers a range
of benefits for participating User Groups. LUGs are also free to
participate in 
<A HREF="http://www.LinuxMall.com/mallrfr.html">Linux Mall's Referral Program</A> as well.
<P>
<DT><B>Cleveland Linux User's Group</B><DD><P>Owns the Internet domain,
<CODE>lug.net</CODE>. They will provide your LUG an Internet domain name
at <CODE>lug.net</CODE>: your-LUG-name-or-city<CODE>lug.net</CODE>. More
information may be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.lug.net/">LUG.NET</A> or by e-mailing 
<A HREF="mailto:jeff@cia.net">Jeff  Garvas</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>Red Hat Software's User Group Program</B><DD><P>Assists LUGs to
develop and grow. More information may be found at
