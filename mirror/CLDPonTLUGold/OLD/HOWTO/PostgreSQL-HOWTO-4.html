</H2>

<P>PostgreSQL defeated Oracle 8 (and 8i), IBM DB2, MS SQL server, Sybase, Interbase
and MySQL in standard benchmark tests in performance, speed, scalability and reliability!
Read the benchmarks at

</H2>

<P>MySQL is another open-source SQL server, but it does not support
transactions. It is suitable for very small databases and does not
support advanced SQL functionalities. Whereas PostgreSQL is an enterprise strength database
supporting transactions and almost all SQL constructs.
PostgreSQL is much more advanced than commercial databases like Oracle, Sybase
and Informix. PostgreSQL supports very advanced locking mechanisms and many more
advanced features which are not available in commercial database systems!!
<P>In near future development of MySQL will be dropped, 
since MySQL is duplicate product working towards ANSI SQL. 
We would take the most advanced and mature open-source SQL server and
drop all others as we do not have lots of time (to deal with multiple
RDBMSes)!! In fact, you do not have time to deal with just one
powerful SQL server like PostgreSQL!
And all the MySQL users will be migrated to PostgreSQL. 
Also MySQL is a 'quasi-commercial' product unlike 
PostgreSQL which is open-source and there is no license fee.
There is no need for another SQL database system as PostgreSQL is already
here in this world!!
<P>Duplicate products like MySQL confuse the user base and causes division of
resources. For a <B>"NEAR PERFECT"</B> system there must be <B>only one</B>
system and everybody in the world must work on it!!
Duplicate products cause more harm than good and hence division of 
resources must be strongly discouraged. This already happened in case of
commercial database systems like Oracle, Sybase, Informix and MS SQL server
which caused splintering of user base and often they are incompatible.
<B><I>I want put the source code of SQL server under your control!!!</I></B>
<P>You do not need hundreds of database systems, all you need is just one
best database server which happens to be 'PostgreSQL'.
<P><B>WARNING: </B> It is possible to create infinite number of 
database systems for a given specification like ANSI SQL!!
<P>Features which are missing in MySQL and which PostgreSQL supports are - 
<UL>
<LI> Transactions</LI>
<LI> Stored Procedures </LI>
<LI> Triggers (update, insert and delete)</LI>
<LI> Object oriented databases</LI>
<LI> Advanced locking systems, concurrency management under multi-user, mutli-transactions environment</LI>
<LI> Sub-queries</LI>
<LI> Server-side cursors</LI>
<LI> Query caching</LI>
<LI> Locking of databases</LI>
<LI> Better table join supports (JOIN, UNION, MINUS, INTERSECT, outer join)</LI>
<LI> And many more advanced features - too numerous to list here.</LI>
</UL>

</H2>

<P>PostgreSQL should be compared with systems like Oracle, both are really
true ACID compliant robust systems developed over a very long time.
It is very much wrong to compare
MySQL with Oracle or MySQL with PostgreSQL. For more details read
<A HREF="http://openacs.org/philosophy/why-not-mysql.html">Why Not MySQL</A>.
Hence, it will be a very serious mistake to replace Oracle with MySQL!!
If you want to replace Oracle then consider PostgreSQL.
