<P>I encourage anyone and everyone who maintains a Linux distribution
or mail order service, to submit information on their service to
this HOWTO. It's easy and fun, and it's free advertising. This
document is posted to many places and is archived (see the next
section).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Types of Submissions</A>
</H2>

<P>We are interested in submissions for: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Complete distributions of Linux software available on CD-ROM.
(We no longer carry FTP-only distributions, as this document is
aimed primarily at new users for which they are not appropriate.)
By `complete distribution' we mean any set of software which can be
used to build a complete Linux system from scratch.
</LI>
<LI>Layered products or individual software packages available only
via mail order. If your software package is available via
anonymous FTP, chances are people can find it. Software products
only available via mail-order include commercial things such as
Motif, and any other commercial software ported to Linux.
</LI>
<LI>Any other <EM>Linux-specific</EM> goods available via mail order, 
such as Linux-specific books and documentation, T-shirts, and 
assorted paraphrenalia.   Note: our interest in the latter
categories is marginal -- this is a Linux Distributions HOWTO,
not a catalogue of cutesy Linux junk.  Whatever you're
selling will have to be (a) very useful, (b) very original, or
(c) very funny, to get listed here.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If the number of submissions for services and layered products
is large, I'll create a separate HOWTO for these items. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 How to submit</A>
</H2>

<P>To submit an entry to this HOWTO, please send mail to 
<CODE>esr@snark.thyrsus.com</CODE> with the following information. This 
format is not machine-parsable; any of the fields may be any
length that you wish, but I'd like to keep each entry down to,
say, 50 lines.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Submission Guidelines</A>
</H2>

<P>Please keep your entry as short as possible. If you need to include
extensive information, please make a reference to where one can FTP
or mail to get more information on your distribution; these entries
are only meant to be <EM>pointers</EM> to where one can find information
on your service or distribution. 
<P>If you provide more than one service or distribution, please use 
<EM>separate entries</EM> for each.
<P>I may edit your entries for conciseness and brevity, if I find 
any irrelevant information, or if the entry is overly verbose. 
Otherwise the content should remain the same.
<P>When making submissions to the Distribution-HOWTO, you grant implicit
permission for me to use the entries in other materials, such as books 
from the LDP, and other online documents. For example, information
from the Distribution-HOWTO may be included in a published Linux book.
If you do not want me to include your entry in materials other than
the Distribution-HOWTO, please say so.
<P>
