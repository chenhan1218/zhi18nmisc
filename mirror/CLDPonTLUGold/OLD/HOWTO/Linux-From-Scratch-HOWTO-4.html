<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Preparing the new system</A> </H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 How we are going to do things</A>
 </H2>

<P>We are going to build the LFS system using an already installed Linux distribution
such as Debian, SuSe, Slackware, Mandrake, RedHat, etc. You don't need to have
any kind of bootdisk. We will use an existing Linux system as the base (since
we need a compiler, linker, text editor and other tools).
<P>If you don't have Linux installed yet, you won't be able to put this document
to use right away. I suggest you first install a Linux distribution. It really
doesn't matter which one you install. It also doesn't need to be the latest
version, though it shouldn't be a too old one. If it is about a year old or
newer it'll do just fine. You will safe yourself a lot of trouble if your normal
system uses glibc-2.0 or newer. Libc5 can cause some problems and is not supported
in this document as I don't have access to such a machine anymore.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Creating a new partition</A>
 </H2>

<P>Before we can build our new Linux system, we need to have an empty Linux
partition on which we can build our new system. I recommend a partition size
of at least 5 00 MB. You can get away with around 250MB for a bare system with
no extra whistles and bells (such as software for emailing, networking, Internet,
X Window System and such). If you already have a Linux Native partition available,
you can skip this subsection.
<P>Start the <CODE>fdisk</CODE> program (or some other fdisk program if you prefer) with
the appropriate hard disk as the option (like /dev/hda if you want to create
a new partition on the primary master IDE disk). Create a Linux Native partition,
write the partition table and exit the fdisk program. If you get the message
that you need to reboot your system to ensure that that partition table is
updated, then please reboot your system now before continuing. Remember what
your new partition's designation is. It could be something like hda5 (as it
is in my case). This newly created partition will be referred to as the <EM>LFS
partition</EM> in this document.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Creating an ext2 file system on the new partition</A>
 </H2>

<P>Once the partition is created, we have to create a new ext2 file system
on that partition. To create a new ext2 file system we use the <CODE>mke2fs</CODE> command.
Enter the new partition as the only option and the file system will be created.
If your partition was hda5, you would run the command as <CODE>mke2fs /dev/hda5</CODE>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Mounting the new partition</A>
 </H2>

<P>Once we have created the ext2 file system, it is ready for use. All we
have to do to be able to access it (as in reading from and writing date to
it) is mounting it. If you mount it under /mnt/hda5, you can access this partition
by going to the /mnt/hda5 directory and then do whatever you need to do. This
document will assume that you have mounted the partition on a subdirectory
under /mnt. It doesn't matter which subdirectory you choose (or you can use
just the /mnt directory as the mounting point), but a good practice is to create
a directory with the same name as the partition's designation. In my case the
LFS partition is called hda5 and therefore I mount it on /mnt/hda5
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create the /mnt directory if it doesn't exist yet</LI>
<LI>Create the /mnt/xxx directory where xxx is to be replaced by your LFS partition's
designation.</LI>
<LI>Mount the LFS partition by running: mount /dev/xxx /mnt/xxx and replace
xxx by your LFS partition's designation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This directory (/mnt/xxx) is the $LFS you have read about earlier.
So if you read somewhere to "cp inittab $LFS/etc" you actually will type
"cp inittab /mnt/xxx/etc" where xxx is replaced by your partition's designation.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Creating directories</A>
 </H2>

<P>Let's create the directory tree on the LFS partition according to the FHS
standard which can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</A>. Issuing the following commands will create
the necessary directories.
<P>
<PRE>
cd $LFS
mkdir bin boot dev etc home lib mnt proc root sbin tmp usr var
cd $LFS/usr
mkdir bin include lib sbin share src
ln -s share/man man
ln -s share/doc doc
ln -s . local
ln -s ../etc etc
ln -s ../var var
cd $LFS/usr/share
mkdir dict doc info locale man nls misc terminfo zoneinfo
cd $LFS/usr/share/man
mkdir man1 man2 man3 man4 man5 man6 man7 man8
cd $LFS/var
mkdir lock log run spool tmp
 
</PRE>
<P>Now that the directories are created, copy the source files you have downloaded
in chapter 3 to some subdirectory under $LFS/usr/src (you will need
to create this subdirectory yourself).
<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Copying the /dev directory</A>
 </H2>

<P>We can create every single file that we need to be in the $LFS/dev
directory using the mknod command, but that just takes up a lot of time. I
choose to just simply copy the current /dev directory to the $LFS partition.
Use this command to copy the entire directory while preserving original rights,
symlinks and ownerships:
<P>
<PRE>
cp -av /dev $LFS
chown root.root $LFS/dev/*
