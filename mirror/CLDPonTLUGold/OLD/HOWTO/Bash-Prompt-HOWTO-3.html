<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Bash Programming and Shell Scripts</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Variables</A>
</H2>

<P>I'm not going to try to explain all the details of Bash scripting in
a section of this HOWTO, just the details pertaining to prompts.  If
you want to know more about shell programming and Bash in general, I highly
recommend <EM>Learning the Bash Shell</EM> by Cameron Newham and Bill
Rosenblatt (O'Reilly, 1998).  Oddly, my copy of this book is quite frayed.
Again, I'm going to assume that you know a fair
bit about Bash already.  You can skip this section if you're only looking
for the basics, but remember it and refer back if you proceed much farther.
<P>
<P>Variables in Bash are assigned much as they are in any programming
language:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
testvar=5
foo=zen
bar="bash prompt"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Quotes are only needed in an assignment if a space (or special character,
discussed shortly) is a part of the variable.
<P>
<P>Variables are referenced slightly differently than they are assigned:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&gt; echo $testvar
5
&gt; echo $foo
zen
&gt; echo ${bar}
bash prompt
&gt; echo $NotAssigned

&gt; 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A variable can be referred to as <B>$bar</B> or <B>${bar}</B>.  The
braces are useful when it is unclear what is being referenced: if I write
<B>$barley</B> do I mean <B>${bar}ley</B> or <B>${barley}</B>?  Note
also that referencing a value that hasn't been assigned doesn't generate an
error, instead returning nothing.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Quotes and Special Characters</A>
</H2>

<P>If you wish to include a special character in a variable, you will have to
quote it differently:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&gt; newvar=$testvar
&gt; echo $newvar
5
&gt; newvar="$testvar"
&gt; echo $newvar
5
&gt; newvar='$testvar'
&gt; echo $newvar
$testvar
&gt; newvar=\$testvar
&gt; echo $newvar
$testvar
&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The dollar sign isn't the only character that's special to the Bash shell,
but it's a simple example.  An interesting step we can take to make use of
assigning a variable name to another variable name is to use <B>eval</B>
to dereference the stored variable name:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&gt; echo $testvar
5
&gt; echo $newvar
$testvar
&gt; eval echo $newvar
5
&gt; 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Normally, the shell does only one round of substitutions on the expression
it is evaluating: if you say <B>echo $newvar</B> the shell will only go
so far as to determine that <B>$newvar</B> is equal to the text string
<B>$testvar</B>, it won't evaluate what <B>$testvar</B> is equal to.
<B>eval</B> forces that evaluation.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Command Substitution</A>
</H2>

<P>In almost all cases in this document, I use the $(&lt;command&gt;)
convention for command substitution: that is, 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$(date +%H%M)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>means "substitute the output from the <B>date +%H%M</B> command here."
This works in Bash 2.0+.  In some older versions of Bash, prior to 1.14.7,
you may need to use backquotes (<CODE>`date +%H%M`</CODE>).  Backquotes can be
used in Bash 2.0+, but are being phased out in favor of $(), which nests
better.  If you're using an earlier version of Bash, you can usually
substitute backquotes where you see $().  If the command substitution is
escaped (ie.  \$(command) ), then use backslashes to escape BOTH your
backquotes (ie.  \'command\' ).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="nonprintingchars"></A> <A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Non-Printing Characters in Prompts</A>
</H2>

<P>Many of the changes that can be made to Bash prompts that are discussed in
this HOWTO use non-printing characters.  Changing the colour of the prompt
text, changing an Xterm title bar, and moving the cursor position all
require non-printing characters.
<P>
<P>If I want a very simple prompt consisting of a greater-than sign and a
space:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[giles@nikola giles]$ PS1='&gt; '
&gt; 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is just a two character prompt.  If I modify it so that it's a
bright yellow greater-than sign (colours are discussed in their own
section):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&gt; PS1='\033[1;33m&gt;\033[0m '
&gt; 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This works fine - until you type in a large command line.  Because the
prompt still only consists of two printing characters (a greater-than sign
and a space) but the shell thinks that this prompt is eleven characters
long (I think it counts '\033' , '[1' and '[0' as one character each).  You
can see this by typing a really long command line - you will find that the
shell wraps the text before it gets to the edge of the terminal, and in
most cases wraps it badly.  This is because it's confused about the actual
length of the prompt.
<P>
<P>So use this instead:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&gt; PS1='\[\033[1;33m\]&gt;\[\033[0m\] '
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is more complex, but it works.  Command lines wrap properly.  What's
been done is to enclose the '\033[1;33m' that starts the yellow colour in
'\[' and '\]' which tells the shell "everything between these escaped
square brackets, including the brackets themselves, is a non-printing
character."  The same is done with the '\033[0m' that ends the colour.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Sourcing a File</A>
</H2>

<P>When a file is sourced (by typing either <B>source filename</B> or <B>.
filename</B> at the command line), the lines of code in the file are
executed as if they were printed at the command line.  This is particularly
useful with complex prompts, to allow them to be stored in files and called
up by sourcing the file they are in.
<P>
<P>In examples, you will find that I often include <B>#!/bin/bash</B> at the
beginning of files including functions.  This is <B>not</B> necessary if
you are sourcing a file, just as it isn't necessary to <B>chmod +x</B> a
file that is going to be sourced.  I do this because it makes Vim (my
editor of choice, no flames please - you use what you like) think I'm
editing a shell script and turn on colour syntax highlighting.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Functions, Aliases, and the Environment</A>
</H2>

<P>As mentioned earlier, PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PROMPT_COMMAND are all stored
in the Bash environment.  For those of us coming from a DOS background, the
idea of tossing big hunks of code into the environment is horrifying, 
because that DOS environment was small, and didn't exactly grow well.
There are probably practical limits to what you can and should put in the
environment, but I don't know what they are, and we're probably talking a
couple of orders of magnitude larger than what DOS users are used to.  As
Dan put it:
<P>
<P>"In my interactive shell I have 62 aliases and 25 functions.  My rule
of thumb is that if I need something solely for interactive use and
can handily write it in bash I make it a shell function (assuming
it can't be easily expressed as an alias).  If these people are
worried about memory they don't need to be using bash.  Bash is one
of the largest programs I run on my linux box (outside of Oracle).
Run top sometime and press 'M' to sort by memory - see how close
bash is to the top of the list.  Heck, it's bigger than sendmail!
Tell 'em to go get ash or something."
<P>
<P>I guess he was using console only the day he tried that: running X and X
apps, I have a lot of stuff larger than Bash.  But the idea is the same:
the environment is something to be used, and don't worry about overfilling
it.
<P>
<P>I risk censure by Unix gurus when I say this (for the crime of
over-simplification), but functions are basically small shell scripts that
are loaded into the environment for the purpose of efficiency.  Quoting Dan
again: "Shell functions are about as efficient as they can be.  It is the
approximate equivalent of sourcing a bash/bourne shell script save that no
file I/O need be done as the function is already in memory.  The shell
functions are typically loaded from [.bashrc or .bash_profile] depending on
whether you want them only in the initial shell or in subshells as well.
Contrast this with running a shell script: Your shell forks, the child does
an exec, potentially the path is searched, the kernel opens the file and
examines enough bytes to determine how to run the file, in the case of a
shell script a shell must be started with the name of the script as its
argument, the shell then opens the file, reads it and executes the
statements.  Compared to a shell function, everything other than executing
the statements can be considered unnecessary overhead."
<P>
<P>Aliases are simple to create:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
alias d="ls --color=tty --classify"
alias v="d --format=long"
alias rm="rm -i"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Any arguments you pass to the alias are passed to the command line of the
aliased command (ls in the first two cases).  Note that aliases can be
nested, and they can be used to make a normal unix command behave in a
different way.  (I agree with the argument that you shouldn't use the
latter kind of aliases - if you get in the habit of relying on "rm *" to
ask you if you're sure, you may lose important files on a system that
doesn't use your alias.)
<P>
<P>Functions are used for more complex program structures.  As a general rule,
use an alias for anything that can be done in one line.  Functions differ
from shell scripts in that they are loaded into the environment so that
they work more quickly.  As a general rule again, you would want to
keep functions relatively small, and any shell script that gets relatively
large should remain a shell script rather than turning it into a function.
Your decision to load something as a function is also going to depend on
how often you use it.  If you use a small shell script infrequently, leave
it as a shell script.  If you use it often, turn it into a function.
<P>
<P>To modify the behaviour of <B>ls</B>, you could do something like the
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
function lf
{ 
    ls --color=tty --classify $*
    echo "$(ls -l $* | wc -l) files"
}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This could readily be set as an alias, but for the sake of example, we'll
make it a function.  If you type the text shown into a text file and then
source that file, the function will be in your environment, and be
immediately available at the command line without the overhead of a shell
script mentioned previously.  The usefulness of this becomes more obvious
if you consider adding more functionality to the above function, such as
using an if statement to execute some special code when links are found in
the listing.
