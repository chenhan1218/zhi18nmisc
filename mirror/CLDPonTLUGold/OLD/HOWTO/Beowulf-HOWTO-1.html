</H2>

<P>Jacek Radajewski started work on this document in November 1997 and
was soon joined by Douglas Eadline.  Over a few months the Beowulf
HOWTO grew into a large document, and in August 1998 it was split into
three documents: Beowulf HOWTO, Beowulf Architecture Design HOWTO, and
the Beowulf Installation and Administration HOWTO.  Version 1.0.0 of
the Beowulf HOWTO was released to the Linux Documentation Project on
11 November 1998.  We hope that this is only the beginning of what
will become a complete Beowulf Documentation Project.

<LI>Jacek Radajewski works as a Network Manager, and is studying for
an honors degree in computer science at the University of Southern
Queensland, Australia.  Jacek's first contact with Linux was in 1995
and it was love at first sight.  Jacek built his first Beowulf cluster
in May 1997 and has been playing with the technology ever since,
always trying to find new and better ways of setting things up.  You
