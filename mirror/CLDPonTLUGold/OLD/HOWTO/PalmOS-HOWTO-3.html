<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Sharing Data Between Palm OS and Linux Systems</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 The pilot-link software</A>
</H2>

<P>The pilot-link suite of software tools allows you to download
programs onto your Palm OS device, and transfer data for the Palm OS device's various built-in
programs between the Linux system and the Palm OS device.
While these programs are not quite as seamless as the desktop
software that comes with the Palm OS device, they do allow you to copy your
data in both directions.
In general, each separate program in the <CODE>pilot-link</CODE> suite
manages one type of data.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Installing the pilot-link software</H3>

<P>The prepackaged versions will inevitably lag slightly behind the master
distribution, but will be easier to install and not require configuration.
The master distribution might be a better choice in those rare occasions
when you have been waiting for a particular feature or bug fix.
<P>You can get the <I>Debian Linux</I> (i386) port of
<I>pilot-link</I> version 0.8.7 from
<CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-i386/otherosfs/pilot-link_0.8.7-2.deb">ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-i386/otherosfs/pilot-link_0.8.7-2.deb</A></CODE>.
If this file does not exist, you will likely find a newer version located
in the same directory.
If all else fails, or if you want a more recent version than has been
packaged for Debian, you can install the generic distribution, as
detailed below.
Install this file in the normal manner and skip to
<I>Using the pilot-link software</I>.
<P>You can get the <I>RedHat Linux</I> (i386) port of
<I>pilot-link</I> version 0.8.9 from 
<CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/i386/pilot-link-0.8.9-1.i386.rpm">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/i386/pilot-link-0.8.9-1.i386.rpm</A></CODE>.
If this file does not exist, you will likely find a newer version located
in the same directory.
If all else fails, or if you want a more recent version than has been
packaged for RedHat, you can install the generic distribution, as
detailed below.
Install this file in the normal manner and skip to
<I>Using the pilot-link software</I>.
<P>For other versions of Linux or unix, or if you need the absolute latest
version, download the version 0.9.0 of pilot-link from 
<CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz">ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz</A></CODE>.
The version number is likely to change, but new versions should end up
in the same location with a similar name.
<P>Once you have the software distribution, unpack it with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar -xvzf pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If your version of tar does not support the <CODE>-z</CODE> option,
decompress the archive with gunzip, as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
gunzip pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will create a directory (<CODE>pilot-link.0.9.0</CODE>) containing the
source.
<P>Change your working directory to the source (<CODE>pilot-link.0.9.0</CODE>)
directory.
<P>Run <CODE>./configure</CODE>.
This will search through your system for information needed to compile
the software.
<CODE>configure</CODE> will set things up to be installed in
<CODE>/usr/local</CODE> by default.
If you want to change it, run <CODE>./configure --prefix=DIR</CODE>, where
<CODE>DIR</CODE> is replaced with the name of the directory to which the
software will be installed.
<P>Run <CODE>make</CODE>.
This will compile the software.
The software will not be installed until later, so that you have a chance
to try it out first.
(If you are replacing an older version with a newer release, you may wish
to check and make sure that no functionality that you need has been broken.
Generally, this is not a problem.)
<P>As the root user, run <CODE>make install</CODE>.
This will copy the software into directories under <CODE>/usr/local</CODE>
(or wherever you specified with the <CODE>--prefix</CODE> option).
If you can not log in as root, you can install the software to some
directory where you have write access.
<P>Don't forget to add any new directories of executables to your search path.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="using pilot-link"></A> Using the pilot-link software</H3>

<P>Most of the programs in the <CODE>pilot-link</CODE> suite are <I>conduits</I>,
that is they transfer data into or out of your Palm OS device.
<P>Each time you use of one of these programs, press the HotSync button on your
Palm OS device's cradle.
This will initiate the Palm OS device side of the data transfer.
Note that not all of these programs prompt you to press the
`HotSync' button, so you may have to remember to do it yourself.
<P>
<P>For more details, and other options to these programs, view the
corresponding manual page.
There is an overview manual page under the name <CODE>pilot-link</CODE>.
For the <CODE>pilot-xfer</CODE> program, for example, type
<CODE>man pilot-xfer</CODE> at your unix shell prompt.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="pilot-xfer"></A> pilot-xfer</H3>

<P>Possibly the most useful program in the pilot-link suite,
<CODE>pilot-xfer</CODE> allows you to install programs on your Palm OS device, make
a backup, and restore that backup.
<P>
<P>To install a program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -i program.prc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To backup your Palm OS device:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -b backup-directory
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This will copy all of the databases on your Palm OS device, (including programs?)
to a directory called ``backup-directory'', creating it if it does not
already exist.
<P>To restore data to Palm OS device:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -r backup-directory
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Generally, you will only need to do this if your Palm OS device loses power
or if you have to do a hard reset.
<P>To list the programs on your Palm OS device:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -l
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>install-memo</H3>

<P>Install a Linux file onto the Palm OS device as a memo.
<P>To install a memo into your (already existing) <I>project</I> category:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
install-memo /dev/pilot -c project project.memo
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The name of the file will be inserted into the memo as its first line 
and will appear in the directory of memos on your Palm OS device.
<P>
<P>
<H3>memos</H3>

<P>This program grabs each memo from the Palm OS device and prints it out in
standard mailbox format.
<P>To view your memos:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
memos /dev/pilot 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>pilot-addresses</H3>

<P><CODE>pilot-addresses</CODE> Transfer the address database to or from the Palm OS device.
<P>To write your address data to a Linux file from your Palm OS device:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
pilot-addresses /dev/pilot -w storage.file
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To read your address data from a Linux file onto your Palm OS device:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
pilot-addresses /dev/pilot -r storage.file
