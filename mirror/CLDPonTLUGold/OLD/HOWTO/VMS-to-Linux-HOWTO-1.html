<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Why Linux?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You've heard that UNIX is difficult and balk at the prospect of leaving VMS,
don't you? Don't worry. Linux, one of the finest UNIX clones, is not more
difficult to use than VMS; actually, I find it easier. Although VMS
aficionados may not agree, in many people's opinion Linux is much more
powerful and versatile.
<P>Linux and VMS are both good operating systems and accomplish essentially the
same tasks, but Linux has a few features that make it a good alternative to
VMS. Moreover, Linux is available for PCs while VMS is not, and modern
Pentium-based Linux machines can outperform a VAX. The icing on the cake is
the excellent performance of modern video cards, which turn an X11-based
Linux box into a fast graphic workstation; nearly always, quicker than
dedicated machines.
<P>I imagine you're a university researcher or a student, and that you use 
VMS for the following everyday tasks:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> writing papers with TeX/LaTeX;</LI>
<LI> programming in Fortran;</LI>
<LI> doing some graphics;</LI>
<LI> using Internet services;</LI>
<LI> et cetera.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the following sections I'm going to explain to you how to do these 
tasks under Linux, exploiting your experience with VMS. Prerequisites:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Linux and X Window System are properly installed;
</LI>
<LI> there's a system administrator to take care of the technical
details (please get help from them, not from me ;-) ;
</LI>
<LI> your shell---the equivalent of <CODE>DCL</CODE>---is <CODE>bash</CODE> (ask your 
sysadm).
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Please note that this HOWTO is not enough to acquaint you fully with 
Linux: it only contains the bare essential to get you started. You 
should learn more about Linux to make the most of it (advanced <CODE>bash</CODE> 
features, programming, regular expressions...). From now on, RMP means 
`please read the man pages for further details'. The man pages are the 
equivalent of the command <CODE>HELP</CODE>.
<P>The Linux Documentation Project documents, available on 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP</A>, are an important source of
information. I suggest that you read Larry Greenfield's ``Linux User
Guide''---it's invaluable for the novice user.
<P>And now, go ahead.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Comparing Commands and Files</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This table attempts to compare VMS' and Linux' most used commands. Please 
keep in mind that the syntax is often very different; for more details,
refer to the following sections.
