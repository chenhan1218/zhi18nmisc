<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>Welcome, gentle reader.
<P>This document hopes to enlighten you on how to do more with Linux 2.2/2.4
routing. Unbeknownst to most users, you already run tools which allow you to
do spectacular things. Commands like 'route' and 'ifconfig' are actually
very thin wrappers for the very powerful iproute2 infrastructure
<P>I hope that this HOWTO will become as readable as the ones by Rusty Russell
of (amongst other things) netfilter fame.
<P>You can always reach us by writing the 
<A HREF="mailto:HOWTO@ds9a.nl">HOWTO team</A>.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Prior knowledge</A>
</H2>

<P>As the title implies, this is the 'Advanced' HOWTO. While by no means rocket
science, some prior knowledge is assumed. This document is meant as a sequel
to the 
<A HREF="http://www.ds9a.nl/2.4Networking/">Linux 2.4 Networking HOWTO</A> by the same authors. You should
probably read that first.
<P>Here are some orther references which might help learn you more:
<DL>
<DT><B>
<A HREF="http://netfilter.kernelnotes.org/unreliable-guides/networking-concepts-HOWTO.html">Rusty Russell's networking-concepts-HOWTO</A></B><DD><P>Very nice introduction, explaining what a network is, and how it is
connected to other networks
<DT><B>Linux Networking-HOWTO (Previously the Net-3 HOWTO)</B><DD><P>Great stuff, although very verbose. It learns you a lot of stuff that's
already configured if you are able to connect to the internet. 
Should be located in /usr/doc/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO.txt but can be also be found 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxports.com/howto/networking">online</A></DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 What Linux can do for you</A>
</H2>

<P>A small list of things that are possible:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Throttle bandwidth for certain computers</LI>
<LI>Throttle bandwidth to certain computers</LI>
<LI>Help you to fairly share your bandwidth</LI>
<LI>Protect your network from DoS attacks</LI>
<LI>Protect the internet from your customers</LI>
<LI>Multiplex several servers as one, for load balancing or
enhanced availability</LI>
<LI>Restrict access to your computers</LI>
<LI>Limit access of your users to other hosts</LI>
<LI>Do routing based on user id (yes!), MAC address, source IP
address, port, type of service, time of day or content</LI>
</UL>
<P>Currently not many people are using these advanced features. This has several
reasons. While the provided documentation is verbose, it is not very hands
on. Traffic control is almost undocumented.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Housekeeping notes</A>
</H2>

<P>There are several things which should be noted about this document. While I
wrote most of it, I really don't want it to stay that way. I am a strong
believer in Open Source, so I encourage you to send feedback, updates,
patches etcetera. Do not hesitate to inform me of typos or plain old errors.
If my English sounds somewhat wooden, please realise that I'm not a native
speaker. Feel free to send suggestions.
<P>If you feel to you are better qualified to maintain a section, or think that
you can author and maintain new sections, you are welcome to do so. The SGML
of this HOWTO is available via CVS, I very much envision more people
working on it.
<P>In aid of this, you will find lots of FIXME notices. Patches are always
welcome! Wherever you find a FIXME, you should know that you are treading
unknown territory. This is not to say that there are no errors elsewhere,
but be extra careful. If you have validated something, please let us know so
we can remove the FIXME notice.
<P>About this HOWTO, I will take some liberties along the road. For example, I
postulate a 10Mbit internet connection, while I know full well that those
are not very common.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Access, CVS &amp; submitting updates</A>
</H2>

<P>The canonical location for the HOWTO is 
<A HREF="http://www.ds9a.nl/2.4Routing">here</A>.
<P>We now have anonymous CVS access available for the world at large. This is
good in several ways. You can easily upgrade to newer versions of this
HOWTO and submitting patches is no work at all.
<P>Furthermore, it allows the authors to work on the source independently,
which is good too.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anon@outpost.ds9a.nl:/var/cvsroot
$ cvs login
CVS password: [enter 'cvs' (without 's)]
$ cvs co 2.4routing
cvs server: Updating 2.4routing
U 2.4routing/2.4routing.sgml
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you spot an error, or want to add something, just fix it locally, and run
cvs diff -u, and send the result off to us.
<P>A Makefile is supplied which should help you create postscript, dvi, pdf,
html and plain text. You may need to install sgml-tools, ghostscript and
tetex to get all formats.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Mailing list</A>
</H2>

<P>The authors receive an increasing amount of mail about this HOWTO. Because
of the clear interest of the community, it has been decided to start a
mailinglist where people can talk to each other about Advanced Routing and
Traffic Control. You can subscribe to the list
<A HREF="http://mailman.ds9a.nl/mailman/listinfo/lartc">here</A>.
<P>It should be pointed out that the authors are very hesitant of answering
questions asked not on the list. We would like the archive of the list to
become some kind of knowledge base. If you have a question, please search
the archive, and then post to the mailinglist.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 Layout of this document</A>
</H2>

<P>We will be doing interesting stuff almost immediately, which also means that
there will initially be parts that are explained incompletely or are not
perfect. Please gloss over these parts and assume that all will become clear.
<P>Routing and filtering are two distinct things. Filtering is documented very
well by Rusty's HOWTOs, available here:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://netfilter.kernelnotes.org/unreliable-guides/">Rusty's Remarkably Unreliable Guides</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>We will be focusing mostly on what is possible by combining netfilter and
iproute2.
