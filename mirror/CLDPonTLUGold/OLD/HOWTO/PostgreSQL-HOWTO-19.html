AppGEN is a high level fourth generation language and application generator for producing World Wide Web (WWW) based
applications. These applications are typically used over the internet or within a corporate intranet. AppGEN applications are
implemented as C scripts conforming to the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) standard supported by most Web Servers. 
<P>To use AppGEN you will need the following :- 
<P>PostgresSQL, relational database management system 
<P>A CGI compatible web server such as NCSA's HTTPD 
<P>An ansi C compiler such as GCC 
<P>AppGEN consists of the following Unix (Linux) executables :-
<P>
<UL>
<LI>      defgen, which produces a basic template application from a logical data structure. The applications are capable of adding, updating, deleting and searching for records within the database whilst automatically maintaining referential integrity. 
      </LI>
<LI>      appgen, the AppGEN compiler which compiles the appgen source code into CGI executable C source and HTML formatted documents ready for deployment on a web server. 
      </LI>
<LI>      dbf2sql, an utility for converting dBase III compatible .dbf files into executable SQL scripts. This enables data stored in most DOS/Windows based database packages to be migrated to a SQL server such as PostgresSQL. 
</LI>
<LI>In addition, AppGEN comprises of a collection of HTML documents, GIF files and Java applets which are used at runtime by the system. And of course, like all good software, the full source code is included. </LI>

<B>About DBENGINE : </B>
dbengine is an interface between the WWW and Postgres95 which provides
simple access to any existing database within just a few minutes.
<P>PHP gives you a Perl like language in your documents, but no real
Perl while AppGen and wdb-p95 require that you create some configuration
file for each of your databases -- sound's like you'll first of all have to
learn some sort of new meta language before you can get started.
<P>Unlike other tools you don't have to learn any special programming or
scripting language to get started with dbengine. Also there's no
configuration file for each database, so you don't have to get familiar
with such a new structure.
However - in case you want to gain access to the full features of dbengine
it'd be a good idea to know the Perl language.
<P>The whole system can be configured by simple manipulations of an additional
database that contains closer information about how to visualize your
database access.
You can even specify virtual Fields which are calculated on the fly right
before they're displayed on the screen.

NeoWebScript is a programming language that allows both
simple and complex programs to be embedded into HTML files. 
<P>When an HTML page containing embedded NeoWebScript is
requested, the NeoWebScript-enabled webserver executes the
embedded script(s), producing a webpage containing customized
content created by the program. 
<P>NeoWebScript is a fast, secure, easy to learn way to do powerful,
server-based interactive programming directly in the HTML code in
web pages. With NeoWebScript, counters, email forms, graffiti
walls, guest books and visitor tracking are all easy, even for a
beginning programmer. See how well NeoWebScript holds its'
own vs. PERL and JavaScript. 
<P>If you'd like to install NeoWebScript on your webserver, your
Webmaster needs to read our Sysop FAQ to get started. Theory of
Operations will explain how NeoWebScript works, while
installation will take them through the steps. Management deals with
configuration issues and running the server, tests let you verify correct
NeoWebScript operation, and troubleshooting deals with server
problems. 
<P>There is no cost to you to use
NeoWebScript-2.2 for your ISP, your intranet, or your extranet.
You'll see a full license when you register to download, but it costs 
$ 99 if you want to embed it in your own
product or use it in a commerce (eg. SSL) server. 
<P>NeoWebScript is a module for the Apache webserver that allows
you to embed the Tcl/Tk programming language in your webpages as
a scripting tool. It was invented by Karl Lehenbauer, NeoSoft's
Chief Technical Officer, and documented, enhanced and extended
by NeoSoft's programmers and technical writers. 
<P>The Apache webserver is the world's most popular webserver,
accounting for 68 % of the sites polled.
<P>Tcl/Tk is the powerful, free, cross-platform scripting language
developed by Dr. John Ousterhout. In his own words 
<P>"Tcl/Tk lets software developers get the job done ten
times faster than with toolkits based on C or C++. It's
also a great glue language for making existing
applications work together and making them more
graphical and Internet-aware."
<P>Karl Lehenbauer, Founder and Chief Technical Officer of NeoSoft,
has been part of Tcl/Tk development from the very beginning.
Together with Mark Diehkans, they authored Extended Tcl, also
known as TclX or NeoSoft Tcl, a powerful set of extensions to the
language. Many of the current core Tcl commands originated in
Extended Tcl, and were then imported into the core language by Dr.
Ousterhout.

<P>heitml is a server side extension of HTML and a 4GL language 
at the same time. People can write web applications 
in the HTML style by using new HTML-like tags. 
<P>heitml (pronounced "Hi"-TML) is an extension of HTML and a 
full-featured 4th generation language that enables 
Web-based Applications to interact with data stored in SQL 
databases, without resorting to complex CGI scripts. 
<P>heitml extends HTML on the sever side, dynamically 
converting ".hei" files to HTML format and so is 
compatible with any web browser.It embraces the familiar, 
easy-to-use HTML syntax and provides a large assortment of 
pre-developed Tags and Libraries to take care of tasks 
that formerly required CGI. As XML, heitml provides user 
defined tags. With heitml the user defined markup can 
be translated to HTML and send to a browser. 
<P>heitml targets both HTML designers and professional 
programmers alike. HTML designers can use heitml Tags to 
build dynamic web pages, access SQL databases, or create 
complete web applications. Counters, registration 
databases, search forms, email forms, or hierarchical 
menues can all be created simply by using the 
pre-developed HTML-like Tags found in the many Component 
Libraries. 
<P>For programmers heitml embeds a complete forth generation 
language in HTML

          (e.g. &lt;if>, &lt;while>, and &lt;let> Tags),

plus powerful expression evaluation with integer, real, 
boolean, string, and tuple data types. Tuples have 
reference semantics as in modern object oriented languages 
and are stored on a heap. heitml variables including all 
complex data structures stored on the heap maintain their 
values between pages using the Session Mode. It is 
possible to define your own tags or environment tags and 
even re-define HTML-tags. 
<P>heitml makes it possible to 
<P>- - - develop Web Sites in a structured and modular way, 
drastically reducing maintenance overhead. 
<P>- - - develop intelligent and interactive Web Sites, with 
content that dynamically adapts itself to user needs. 
<P>- - - show the content of SQL databases with no programming 
other than to use our library of prefined "dba" Tags. 
<P>- - - develop complex database and Catalog Shopping applications 
using Session Variables 
<P>heitml runs on Linux with any Web Server using the CGI 
interface, and is especially fast (avoiding the CGI 
overhead) within the APACHE Web Server using the apache API. Currently MSQL 
(Version 1 and 2), PostgreSQL (Version 6), mysql, 
and the yard databases are supported). heitml also 
works on Linux, BSDi, Solaris and SunOS, as well as 
Windows NT with CGI and ISAPI and ODBC and Windows 95. 
<P>heitml (on linux) is free for research, non-commercial and 
private usage. Commercial Web Sites must pay a licensing 
fee. The fully operational version of heitml is available 
for a trial period downloaded freely. (Note, however, that 
each ".hei" Web Page you develop will display a message 
identifying it as the version for non-commercial 
use. After registration, you will receive a key to switch 
off the message without having to re-install the program.) 
<P>heitml (pronounced "Hi"-TML) significantly extends
and enhances the functionality of HTML by definable
tags and full programming features. This makes
dynamic content and database applications possible
simply within the HTML world, without CGI and without
external scripting or programming languages.
This means you, as an HTML author, can embed
applications in your web pages, simply by using some
new tags without CGI and without programming. As an
advanced user or programmer on the other hand you can
create and program powerful tag libraries. This
approach makes heitml suitable for HTML newcomers and
professional programmers alike.
heitml runs on the web server and dynamically
generates HTML, so heitml is compatible with the
internet standards and with any web browser. It
allows full access to databases while shielding the
user from any unneccessary CGI complexity. heitml has
been developed according to the newst research and
in compiler construction and transaction
systems.
<P>heitml pages are developed just the same way as HTML
pages, with a text editor or HTML editor, and placed
on the web server as usual. However now pages can
contain dynamic heitml tags and access tag libraries.
You can use these tags to access the database, to
create dynamic content, to send emails, and even to
create powerful applications like registration
databases and shopping systems.
<P>HTML newcomers and professional programmers alike
will be amazed at how quickly and easily they can
design exciting applications like our Interactive
Guestbook without resorting to complex and difficult
to learn CGI scripts, simply by using the tools
provided in our dba Library.
<P>heitml is accompanied by a wide range of tag
libraries, to create guestbooks, database maintenance
applications, extensible query forms, powerful email
forms or structure your web site using a hierarchic
menu. These tools are ready to go, just add the
corresponding tags to your web site.
<P>As an experienced programmer you can make fully use
of the heitml persistent dynamic tuple architecture :
heitml is not just a scripting language with dynamic
typing, full power expression evaluation, recursive
procedures and extensive parameter passing features,
but it also features persistent dynamic tuples to
automatically keep session data of any size.

<A HREF="http://photo.net/wtr/aolserver/introduction-1.html">http://photo.net/wtr/aolserver/introduction-1.html</A></LI>
</UL>

AOLserver is a fast, fully multithreaded, Tcl enabled webserver. But
not only that, it is a complete database-backed web development
platform.
With AOLserver you can have multiple pooled connections to PostgreSQL
(and other RBDMSs) that can be shared among different threads. AOLserver
has a Tcl and C APIs that allow you to develop powerful dynamic
websites. All this since 1995. It is licensed under the APL (AOLserver
Public License) or the GPL, thus being totally free software.
The Tcl API is the most useful for web sites. AOLserver has a set of
powerful Tcl calls, such as ns_sendmail (to send e-mail), ns_httpget (to
fetch an URL), ns_schedule (a cron-like feature to schedule procedures to
run at specific times), etc. You can also extend AOLserver's
capabilities very easily with the Tcl API. Each AOLserver virtual server
can have its own "library" of private Tcl scripts that are parsed by
AOLserver and become accessible to any page within that virtual server.
You can develop pages for AOLserver in three ways: 
- Plain HTML
- .tcl pages -- these are tcl programs that can return HTML via the
ns_write call.
- .adp pages -- AOL Dynamic Pages. You develop your pages in plain HTML
but you can scape to Tcl code by using &lt;% %> or &lt;%= %> much alike PHP or
ASP.
While AOLserver is a great webserver with a superb architecture, where
it really shines is in database connectivity. AOLserver has its own
database abstraction layer that enables you to have it connected to
different RDBMSs without changing your code at all. The connections do
the RDBMS are pooled, persistent and are shared among different threads.
This allows for very fast connections and efficient use of resources.
AOLserver has drivers for all major RDBMSs: PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase,
Informix, Illustra, Solid, Interbase, MySQL.
