<P> You don't have to understand the basics to use the serial port But
understanding it may help to determine what is wrong if you run into
problems.  This section not only presents new topics but also repeats
some of what was said in the previous section 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-2.html#how_hdw_xfers">How the Hardware Transfers Bytes</A> but in greater detail.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 What is a Serial Port ?</A>
</H2>

<H3>Intro to Serial</H3>

<P> The serial port is an I/O (Input/Output) device.  
<P>An I/O device is just a way to get data into and out of a computer.
There are many types of I/O devices such as serial ports, parallel
ports, disk drive controllers, ethernet boards, universal serial
buses, etc.
Most PC's have one or two serial ports.  Each has a 9-pin connector
(sometimes 25-pin) on the back of the computer.  Computer programs can
send data (bytes) to the transmit pin (output) and receive bytes from
the receive pin (input).  The other pins are for control purposes and
ground.
<P>The serial port is much more than just a connector.  It converts the
data from parallel to serial and changes the electrical representation
of the data.  Inside the computer, data bits flow in parallel (using
many wires at the same time).  Serial flow is a stream of bits over a
single wire (such as on the transmit or receive pin of the serial
connector).  For the serial port to create such a flow, it must
convert data from parallel (inside the computer) to serial on the
transmit pin (and conversely).
<P>Most of the electronics of the serial port is found in a computer chip
(or a part of a chip) known as a UART.  For more details on UARTs
see the section 
<P>
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-15.html#uart_">What Are UARTS?</A> 
But you may want to finish this section first so that you will
hopefully understand how the UART fits into the overall scheme of
things.
<P>
<H3>Pins and Wires</H3>

<P> Old PC's used 25 pin connectors but only about 9 pins were
actually used so today most connectors are only 9-pin.  Each of the 9
pins usually connects to a wire.  Besides the two wires used for
transmitting and receiving data, another pin (wire) is signal ground.
The voltage on any wire is measured with respect to this ground.  Thus
the minimum number of wires to use for 2-way transmission of data is
3.  Except that it has been known to work with no signal ground wire
but with degraded performance and sometimes with errors.
<P>There are still more wires which are for control purposes (signalling)
only and not for sending bytes.  All of these signals could have been
shared on a single wire, but instead, there is a separate dedicated
wire for every type of signal.  Some (or all) of these control wires
are called "modem control lines".  Modem control wires are either in
the asserted state (on) of +12 volts or in the negated state (off) of
-12 volts.  One of these wires is to signal the computer to stop
sending bytes out the serial port cable.  Conversely, another wire
signals the device attached to the serial port to stop sending bytes
to the computer.  If the attached device is a modem, other wires may
tell the modem to hang up the telephone line or tell the computer that
a connection has been made or that the telephone line is ringing
(someone is attempting to call in).  See section
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-16.html#pinout_">Pinout and Signals</A> for more details.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>RS-232 or EIA-232, etc. </H3>

<P> The serial port (not the USB) is usually a RS-232-C, EIA-232-D, or
EIA-232-E.  These three are almost the same thing.  The original RS
(Recommended Standard) prefix became EIA (Electronics Industries
Association) and later EIA/TIA after EIA merged with TIA
(Telecommunications Industries Association).  The EIA-232 spec
provides also for synchronous (sync) communication but the hardware to
support sync is almost always missing on PC's.  The RS designation is
obsolete but is still widely used.  EIA will be used in this howto.
Some documents use the full EIA/TIA designation.  For info on other
(non-EIA-232) serial ports see the section 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-18.html#non_rs232">Other Serial Devices (not async EIA-232)</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 IO Address &amp; IRQ</A>
</H2>

<P> Since the computer needs to communicate with each serial port, the
operating system must know that each serial port exists and where it
is (its I/O address).  It also needs to know which wire (IRQ number)
the serial port must use to request service from the computer's CPU.
It requests service by sending an interrupt on this wire.  Thus every
serial port device must store in its non-volatile memory both its I/O
address and its Interrupt ReQuest number: IRQ.  See 
<A HREF="#interrupt_">Interrupts</A>.  For the PCI bus it doesn't work
exactly this way since the PCI bus has its own system of interrupts.
But since the PCI-aware BIOS sets up chips to map these PCI interrupts
to IRQs, it seemingly behaves just as described above except that
sharing of interrupts is allowed (2 or more devices may use the same
IRQ number).
<P>I/O addresses are not the same as memory addresses.  When an I/O
addresses is put onto the computer's address bus, another wire is
energized.  This both tells main memory to ignore the address and
tells all devices which have I/O addresses (such as the serial port)
to listen to the address to see if it matches the device's.  If the
address matches, then the I/O device reads the data on the data bus.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Names: ttyS0, ttyS1, etc.</A>
</H2>

<P> The serial ports are named ttyS0, ttyS1, etc. (and usually
correspond respectively to COM1, COM2, etc. in DOS/Windows).  The /dev
directory has a special file for each port.  Type "ls /dev/ttyS*" to
see them.  Just because there may be (for example) a ttyS3 file,
doesn't necessarily mean that there exists a physical serial port
there.
<P>Which one of these names (ttyS0, ttyS1, etc.) refers to which
physical serial port is determined as follows.  The serial driver
(software) maintains a table showing which I/O address corresponds to
which ttyS.  This mapping of names (such as ttyS1) to I/O addresses
(and IRQ's) may be both set and viewed by the "setserial" command.
See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-8.html#set_serial">What is Setserial</A>.  This does
<CODE>not</CODE> set the I/O address and IRQ in the hardware itself (which is
set by jumpers or by plug-and-play software).  Thus what physical port
corresponds to say ttyS1 depends both on what the serial driver thinks
(per setserial) and what is set in the hardware.  If a mistake has
been made, the physical port may not correspond to any name (such as
ttyS2) and thus it can't be used.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-7.html#ttySN_">Serial Port Devices /dev/ttyS2, etc.</A> for more details>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="interrupt_"></A> <A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Interrupts </A>
</H2>

<P> 
<P>When the serial port receives a number of bytes (may be set to 1, 4,
8, or 14) into its FIFO buffer, it signals the CPU to fetch them by
sending an electrical signal known as an interrupt on a certain wire
normally used only by that port.  Thus the FIFO waits for a number of
bytes and then issues an interrupt.
<P>However, this interrupt will also be sent if there is an unexpected
delay while waiting for the next byte to arrive (known as a timeout).
Thus if the bytes are being received slowly (such as someone typing on
a terminal keyboard) there may be an interrupt issued for every byte
received.  For some UART chips the rule is like this: If 4 bytes in a
row could have been received, but none of these 4 show up, then the
port gives up waiting for more bytes and issues an interrupt to fetch
the bytes currently in the FIFO.  Of course, if the FIFO is empty,
no interrupt will be issued.
<P>Each interrupt conductor (inside the computer) has a number (IRQ) and
the serial port must know which conductor to use to signal on.  For
example, ttyS0 normally uses IRQ number 4 known as IRQ4 (or IRQ 4).  A
list of them and more will be found in "man setserial" (search for
"Configuring Serial Ports").  Interrupts are issued whenever the
serial port needs to get the CPU's attention.  It's important to do
this in a timely manner since the buffer inside the serial port can
hold only 16 (1 in old serial ports) incoming bytes.  If the CPU fails
to remove such received bytes promptly, then there will not be any
space left for any more incoming bytes and the small buffer may
overflow (overrun) resulting in a loss of data bytes.
There is no 
<A HREF="#flow_control">Flow Control</A> to prevent
this.   
<P>Interrupts are also issued when the serial port has just sent out all
16 of its bytes from its small transmit buffer out the external cable.
It then has space for 16 more outgoing bytes.  The interrupt is to
notify the CPU of that fact so that it may put more bytes in the small
transmit buffer to be transmitted.  Also, when a modem control line
changes state an interrupt is issued.
<P>The buffers mentioned above are all hardware buffers.  The serial port
also has large buffers in main memory.  This will be explained later
<P>Interrupts convey a lot of information but only indirectly.  The
interrupt itself just tells a chip called the interrupt controller
that a certain serial port needs attention.  The interrupt controller
then signals the CPU.  The CPU runs a special program to service the
serial port.  That program is called an interrupt service routine
(part of the serial driver software).  It tries to find out what has
happened at the serial port and then deals with the problem such a
transferring bytes from (or to) the serial port's hardware buffer.
This program can easily find out what has happened since the serial
port has registers at IO addresses known to the the serial driver
software.  These registers contain status information about the serial
port.  The software reads these registers and by inspecting the
contents, finds out what has happened and takes appropriate action.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Data Flow (Speeds)</A>
</H2>

<P> Data (bytes representing letters, pictures, etc.) flows into and
out of your serial port.  Flow rates (such as 56k (56000) bits/sec)
are (incorrectly) called "speed".  But almost everyone says "speed"
instead of "flow rate".  
<P>It's important to understand that the average speed is often less than
the specified speed.  Waits (or idle time) result in a lower average
speed.  These waits may include long waits of perhaps a second due to
<A HREF="#flow_control">Flow Control</A>.  At the other extreme
there may be very short waits (idle time) of several micro-seconds
between bytes.  If the device on the serial port (such as a modem)
can't accept the full serial port speed, then the average speed must
be reduced.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="flow_control"></A> <A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Flow Control </A>
</H2>

<P> Flow control means the ability to slow done the flow of bytes in a
wire.  For serial ports this means the ability to stop and then
restart the flow without any loss of bytes.  Flow control is needed
for modems to allow a jump in instantaneous flow rates.  
<P>
<H3>Example of Flow Control </H3>

<P> For example, consider the case where you connect a 36.6k external
modem via a short cable to your serial port.  The modem sends and
receives bytes over the phone line at  36.6k bits per second (bps).
Assume it's not doing any data compression or error correction.  You
have set the serial port speed to 115,200 bits/sec (bps), and you are
sending data from your computer to the phone line.  Then the flow from
the your computer to your modem over the short cable is at 115.2k bps.
However the flow from your modem out the phone line is only 33.6k bps.
Since a faster flow (115.2k) is going into your modem than is coming
out of it, the modem is storing the excess flow (115.2k -33.6k = 81.6k
bps) in one of its buffers.  This buffer would soon overrun (run out
of free storage space) unless the high 115.2k flow is stopped.  
<P>But now flow control comes to the rescue.  When the modem's buffer is
almost full, the modem sends a stop signal to the serial port.  The
serial port passes on the stop signal on to the device driver and the
115.2k bps flow is halted.  Then the modem continues to send out data
at 33.6k bps drawing on the data it previous accumulated in its
buffer.  Since nothing is coming into the buffer, the level of bytes
in it starts to drop.  When almost no bytes are left in the buffer,
the modem sends a start signal to the serial port and the 115.2k flow
from the computer to the modem resumes.  In effect, flow control
creates an average flow rate in the short cable (in this case 33.6k)
which is significantly less than the "on" flow rate of 115.2k bps.
This is "start-stop" flow control.
<P>In the above simple example it was assumed that the modem did no data
compression.  This would be true when the modem is sending a file
which is already compressed and can't be compressed further.  Now
let's consider the opposite extreme where the modem is compressing the
data with a high compression ratio.  In such a case the modem might
need an input flow rate of say 115.2k bps to provide an output (to the
phone line) of 33.6k bps (compressed data).  The compression ratio is
3.43 (115.2/33.6) which is much higher than average.  In this case the
modem is able to compress and the 115.2 bps PC-to-modem flow and send
the same data out on the phone line at 33.6bps.  There's no need for
flow control here.  But such a high compression ratio rarely happens
so that most of the time flow control is needed to slow down the flow
on the 115.2 bps PC-to-modem cable.  The flow is stopped and started
so that the average flow is usually well under the "on" flow of 115.2
bps.
<P>In the above example the modem was an external modem.  But the same
situation exists (as of late 2000) for most internal modems.  There is
still a speed limit on the PC-to-modem speed even though this flow
doesn't take place over an external cable.  This makes the internal
modems compatible with the external modems.
<P>In the above example of flow control the flow was from the computer to
a modem.  But there is also flow control which is used for the
opposite direction of flow: from a modem (or other device) to a
computer.  Each direction of flow involve 3 buffers: 1. in the modem
2. in the UART chip (called FIFOs) 3. in main memory managed by the
serial driver.  Flow control protects certain buffers from
overflowing.  The small UART FIFO buffers are not protected in this
way but rely instead on a fast response to the interrupts they issue.
FIFO stand for "First In, First Out" which is the way it handles
bytes.  All the 3 buffers use the FIFO rule but only one of them also
uses it as a name.  This is the essence of flow control but there are
still some more details.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Symptoms of No Flow Control</H3>

<P> Understanding flow-control theory can be of practical use.  The
symptom of no flow control is chunks of data missing from files sent
without the benefit of flow control.  This is because when overflow
happens, it's usually more than just a few bytes that overflow and are
lost.  Often hundreds or even thousands of bytes get lost, and all in
contiguous chunks.
<P>
<H3>Hardware vs. Software Flow Control</H3>

<P> If feasible it's best to use "hardware" flow control that uses two
dedicated "modem control" wires to send the "stop" and "start"
signals.  
<P>
<P>Software flow control uses the main receive and transmit wires to send
the start and stop signals.  It uses the ASCII control characters DC1
(start) and DC3 (stop) for this purpose.  They are just inserted into
the regular stream of data.  Software flow control is not only slower
in reacting but also does not allow the sending of binary data unless
special precautions are taken.  Since binary data will likely contain
DC1 and DC3, special means must be taken to distinguish between a DC3
that means a flow control stop and a DC3 that is part of the binary
code.  Likewise for DC1.  
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Data Flow Path; Buffers</A>
</H2>

<P> Much has been explained about this including flow
control, a pair of 16-byte FIFO buffers (in the UART), and a pair of
larger buffers inside a device connected to the serial port (such as a
modem.  But there is still another pair of buffers.  These are large
buffers (perhaps 8k) in main memory also known as serial port buffers.
When an application program sends bytes to the serial port 
<P>they first get stashed in the the transmit serial port buffer in main
memory.  The pair consists of both this transmit buffer and a receive
buffer for the opposite direction of byte-flow.  Here's an example
diagram for the case of browsing the Internet with a browser.
Transmit data flow is left to right while receive flow is right to
left.
<P>
<PRE>
application     8k-byte         16-byte        1k-byte        tele-     
BROWSER ------- MEMORY -------- UART --------- MODEM -------- phone
program         buffer          buffer         buffer         line
</PRE>
<P>The serial device driver takes out say 16 bytes from this transmit buffer,
one byte at a time and puts them into the 16-byte transmit buffer in the
serial UART for transmission.  Once in that transmit buffer, there
is no way to stop them from being transmitted.  They are then
transmitted to the modem or other device connected to the serial port
which also has a fair sized (say 1k) buffer.  When the device driver
(on orders from flow control) stops the flow of outgoing bytes from
the computer, what it actually stops is the flow of outgoing bytes
from the large transmit buffer in main memory.  Even after this has
happened and the flow to the device
connected to the serial port has stopped, an application program
may keep sending bytes to the 8k transmit buffer until it becomes
fill.  
<P>When it gets fill, the application program can't send any more bytes
to it (a "write" statement in a C_program blocks) and the application
program temporarily stops running and waits until some buffer space
becomes available.  Thus a flow control "stop" is ultimately able to
stop the program that is sending the bytes.  Even though this program
stops, the computer does not necessarily stop computing.  It may
switch to running other processes while it's waiting at a flow control
stop.  The above was a little oversimplified since there is another
alternative of having the application program itself do something else
while it is waiting to "write".
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 Complex Flow Control Example</A>
</H2>

<P> For many situations, there is a transmit path involving several
links, each with its own flow control.  For example, I type at a
text-terminal connected to a PC with a modem to access a BBS.  For
this I use the application program "minicom" which deals with 2 serial
ports: one connected to a modem and another connected to the
text-terminal.  What I type at the text terminal goes into the first
serial port to minicom, then from minicom out the second serial port
to the modem, and then onto the telephone line to the BBS.  The
text-terminal has a limit to the speed at which bytes can be displayed
on its screen and issues a flow control "stop" from time to time to
slow down the flow.  What happens when such a "stop" is issued?  Let's
consider a case where the "stop" is long enough to get thru to the BBS
and stop the program at the BBS which is sending out the bytes.  
<P>Let's trace out the flow of this "stop" (which may be "hardware" on
some links and "software" on others).  First, suppose I'm "capturing"
a long file from the BBS which is being sent simultaneously to both my
text-terminal and a to file on my hard-disk.  The bytes are coming in
faster than the terminal can handle them so it sends a "stop" out its
serial port to the first serial port on my PC.  The device driver
detects it and stops sending bytes from the 8k serial buffer (in main
memory) to the terminal.  Now minicom still keeps sending out bytes for
the terminal into this 8k buffer.
<P>When this 8k transmit buffer (on the first serial port) is full,
minicom must stop writing to it.  Minicom stops and waits.  But this
also causes minicom to stop reading from the 8k receive buffer on the
2nd serial port connected to the modem.  Flow from the modem continues
until this 8k buffer too fills up and sends a different "stop" to the
modem.  Now the modem's buffer ceases to send to the serial port and
also fills up.  The modem (assuming error correction is enabled) sends
a "stop signal" to the other modem at the BBS.  This modem stops
sending bytes out of its buffer and when its buffer gets fill, another
stop signal is sent to the serial port of the BBS.  At the BBS, the
8-k (or whatever) buffer fills up and the program at the BBS can't
write to it anymore and thus temporarily halts.  
<P>Thus a stop signal from a text terminal has halted a programs on a BBS
computer.  What a complex sequence of events!  Note that the stop
signal passed thru 4 serial ports, 2 modems, and one application
program (minicom).  Each serial port has 2 buffers (in one direction
of flow): the 8k one and the hardware 16-byte one.  The application
program may have a buffer in its C_code.  This adds up to 11 different
buffers the data is passing thru.  Note that the small serial hardware
buffers do not participate directly in flow control.
<P>If the terminal speed limitation is the bottleneck in the flow from
the BBS to the terminal, then its flow control "stop" is actually
stopping the program that is sending from the BBS as explained above.
But you may ask: How can a "stop" last so long that 11 buffers (some
of them large) all get filled up?   It can actually happen this way if
all the buffers were near their upper limits when the terminal sent
out the "stop".  
<P>But if you were to run a simulation on it you would discover that it's
usually more complicated than this.  At an instant of time some links
are flowing and others are stopped (due to flow control).  A "stop"
from the terminal seldom propagates back to the BBS neatly as
described above.  It may take a few "stops" from the terminal to
result in one "stop" at the BBS.  To understand what is going on you
really need to observe a simulation which can be done for a simple
case with coins on a table.  Use only a few buffers and set the upper
level for each buffer at only a few coins.
<P>Does one really need to understand all this?  Well, understanding this
explained to me why capturing text from a BBS was loosing text.  The
situation was exactly the above example but modem-to-modem flow
control was disabled.  Chunks of captured text that were supposed to
also get to my hard-disk never got there because of an overflow at my
modem buffer due to flow control "stops" from the terminal.  Even
though the BBS had a flow path to the hard-disk without bottlenecks,
the overflow due to the terminal happened on this path and chunks of
text were lost and never even made it to the hard-disk.  Note that the
flow to the hard-disk passed thru my modem and since the overflow
happened there, bytes intended for the hard-disk were lost.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.9">3.9 Serial Driver Module</A>
</H2>

<P> The device driver for the serial port is the software that
operates the serial port.  It is now provided as a serial module.
>From kernel 2.2 on, this module will normally get loaded automatically
if it's needed.  In earlier kernels, you had to have <CODE>kerneld</CODE>
running in order to do auto-load modules on demand.  Otherwise the
serial module needed to be explicitly listed in /etc/modules.  Before
modules became popular with Linux, the serial driver was usually built
into the kernel (and sometimes still is).  If it's built-in don't let
the serial module load or else you will have two serial drivers
running at the same time.  With 2 drivers there are all sorts of
errors including a possible "I/O error" when attempting to open a
serial port.  Use "lsmod" to see if the module is loaded.
<P>When the serial module is loaded it displays a message on the screen
about the existing serial ports (often showing a wrong IRQ).  But once
the module is used by <CODE>setserial</CODE> to tell the device driver the
(hopefully) correct IRQ then you should see a second display similar
to the first but with the correct IRQ, etc.  See
