<H2><A NAME="Introduction"></A> <A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A> </H2>

<P>Before you start reading: I am not a native speaker, so there are
probably spelling/grammatical errors in this document. Feel encouraged
to inform me of mistakes.
<H2><A NAME="WhatisQmail"></A> <A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is Qmail and why should I use it?</A>
 </H2>

<P>Here is the authors (Dan Bernstein) blurb:
<P>Qmail is a secure, reliable, efficient, simple message transfer agent.
It is meant as a replacement for the entire sendmail-binmail system on
typical Internet-connected UNIX hosts.
<P>Secure: Security isn't just a goal, but an absolute requirement. Mail
delivery is critical for users; it cannot be turned off, so it must be
completely secure. (This is why I started writing qmail: I was sick of
the security holes in sendmail and other MTAs.)
<P>Reliable: qmail's straight-paper-path philosophy guarantees that a
message, once accepted into the system, will never be lost. qmail also
supports maildir, a new, super-reliable user mailbox format. Maildirs,
unlike mbox files and mh folders, won't be corrupted if the system
crashes during delivery. Even better, not only can a user safely read
his mail over NFS, but any number of NFS clients can deliver mail to
him at the same time.
<P>Efficient: On a Pentium under BSD/OS, qmail can easily sustain 200000
local messages per day---that's separate messages injected and
delivered to mailboxes in a real test! Although remote deliveries are
inherently limited by the slowness of DNS and SMTP, qmail overlaps 20
simultaneous deliveries by default, so it zooms quickly through
mailing lists. (This is why I finished qmail: I had to get a big
mailing list set up.)
<P>Simple: qmail is vastly smaller than any other Internet MTA. Some
reasons why: (1) Other MTAs have separate forwarding, aliasing, and
mailing list mechanisms. qmail has one simple forwarding mechanism
that lets users handle their own mailing lists. (2) Other MTAs offer a
spectrum of delivery modes, from fast+unsafe to slow+queued. qmail-
send is instantly triggered by new items in the queue, so the qmail
system has just one delivery mode: fast+queued. (3) Other MTAs
include, in effect, a specialized version of inetd that watches the
load average.  qmail's design inherently limits the machine load, so
qmail-smtpd can safely run from your system's inetd.
<P>Replacement for sendmail: qmail supports host and user masquerading,
full host hiding, virtual domains, null clients, list-owner rewriting,
relay control, double-bounce recording, arbitrary RFC 822 address
lists, cross-host mailing list loop detection, per-recipient
checkpointing, downed host backoffs, independent message retry
schedules, etc. In short, it's up to speed on modern MTA features.
qmail also includes a drop-in ``sendmail'' wrapper so that it will be
used transparently by your current UAs.
<H2><A NAME="WhatisVMailMgr"></A> <A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What is VMailMgr and why should I use it?</A>
 </H2>

<P>VMailMgr is:
<P>A password checking interface between qmail-popup and qmail-pop3d which 
replaces the usual checkpassword, as well as an authentication module 
for Courier IMAP, that provide access to the virtual mailboxes by one of 
three methods: 
<UL>
<LI> IP-based virtual server access (invisible to the POP3 user) </LI>
<LI> username-based access (username-virtualuser) </LI>
<LI> hostname-based access (virtualuser@virtual.host or virtualuser:virtual.host) </LI>
</UL>
<P>You should use it if:
<P>You prefer to have the users manage their own domains email accounts, 
and store their email in their own home dir.
(This makes setting up disk space quotas much easier)
<H2><A NAME="WhatisCourier"></A> <A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What is Courier-imap and why should I use it?</A>
 </H2>

<P>Courier-IMAP is:
<P>A server that provides IMAP access to Maildir mailboxes. This IMAP server 
does NOT handle traditional mailbox files (/var/spool/mail, and derivatives), 
it was written for the specific purpose of providing IMAP access to Maildirs.
<P>You should use it because:
<P>By default Qmail uses the newer more efficient Maildir format for storing email,
and Courier-imap is the only imap server I am aware of that supports Maildir.
So in short, if you use Qmail, and want imap support, you have to use it.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Description of the components</A>
</H2>

<P>The email system you hopefully will get after having read this HOWTO is
composed of several parts, the patched Qmail rpms are key to using this
document. I recommend using the software versions I tried, they will 
probably compile without many problems and result in a fairly stable 
daemon. If you are courageous, you can try to compile all the 
latest-stuff-with-tons-of-new-features, but  don't blame me if something
fails ;-). However, you may report other working configurations to be 
included in future versions of this document. All of the steps were tested
on a RedHat Linux 6.2 box, so the HOWTO is somewhat specific, but you should
be able to use it for other linux distributions as well.
<P>You do not necessarily have to install in all components. I tried to
structure this HOWTO so that you can skip the parts you are not
interested in.
<P>The document is neither a user manual to Qmail, VMailMgr nor
Courier-imap. Its prime intention is to save email admins some
headaches when installing their server and to do my little
contribution to the linux community.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Working configurations</A>
</H2>

<P>Though this document is new, I am pretty confident that it can help you
get your email system up and running. 
Combinations that work for me are:
<UL>
<LI> RedHat 6.2, Linux 2.2.14, Qmail 1.03+patches-12, VMailMgr 0.96.6, Courier-imap 0.31</LI>
<LI> Mandrake 7.0, Linux 2.2.13, Qmail 1.03+patches-12, VMailMgr 0.96.6, Courier-imap 0.31</LI>
</UL>

 </H2>

<P>This document was started on April 18, 2000 by Dan Kuykendall after several installs of Qmail and VMailMgr.
Then even more setups when Courier-imap support was ready.
