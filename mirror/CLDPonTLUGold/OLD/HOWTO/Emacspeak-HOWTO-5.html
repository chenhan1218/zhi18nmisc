<P>
<P>The Slackware setup script for Emacspeak should create the needed
environment variables and install a script <CODE>emacspeak</CODE> that starts
emacs with emacspeak.  This is your fourth option for learning Emacs.
This is the first time you will be able to actually use Emacspeak.  A
short tutorial appears below.  Within Emacs, you may type C-h C-e to
get a list of the commands.  To search for a command, use C-h a.  To
get an explanation for a key sequence, use C-h k.  There is also an
info file which is part of the Emacspeak distribution.  Within emacs,
you may type C-h i to open the directory to the info pages.  Search
for the emacspeak menu item by typing C-s emacspeak, then two carriage
returns (one to terminate the search, and a second one to go to the
info page).  If you have the standalone info program installed, you can
consult the info file with the command <CODE>info Emacspeak</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Emacspeak Introduction - Speech Enabled Normal Commands</A>
</H2>

<P>All of the normal Emacs movement commands will speak the relevant
information after moving.  Here are some of the cursor movement
functions that have  been speech enabled.  Note that this list only
enumerates a few of these speech enabled commands; the purpose of
emacspeak is to speech-enable all of emacs and provide you spoken
feedback as you work.  Thus, this list is here only as a
representative example of the kind of speech-enabling extensions
Emacspeak  provides.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>`C-n' or
`M-x next-line' or
`down'</B><DD><P>Moves the cursor to the next line and speaks it.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-p' or
`M-x previous-line' or
`up'</B><DD><P>Moves the cursor to the previous line and speaks it.
<P>
<DT><B>`M-f' or
`M-x forward-word' or</B><DD><P>Moves the cursor to the next word and speaks it.
Places point on the first character of
the next work, rather than on the space preceding it (This is my
personal preference).
<P>
<DT><B>`M-b' or
`M-x backward-word'</B><DD><P>Moves the cursor to the previous word and speaks it.
<P>
<DT><B>`M-C-b' or
`M-x backward-sexp'</B><DD><P>Moves the cursor to the previous sexp and speaks it.  If the sexp
spans more than a line, only the first line is spoken.
<P>
<DT><B>`M-&lt;' or
`M-x beginning-of-buffer'</B><DD><P>Speaks line moved to.
<P>
<DT><B>`M-&gt;' or
`M-x end-of-buffer'</B><DD><P>Speaks line moved to.
<P>
<DT><B>`M-m' or
`M-x back-to-indentation'</B><DD><P>Speaks entire current line.  A useful way of hearing the current
line.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Emacspeak Introduction - New Commands</A>
</H2>

<P>Emacspeak provides a number of commands for reading
portions of the current buffer, getting status information, and
modifying Emacspeak's state.
<P>All of the commands are documented in the subsequent sections.
They can be classified into types:
<P>The first group of commands are for listening to chunks of
information.  The names of these commands all start with the common
prefix `emacspeak-'.  All Emacspeak commands are bound to the keymap
EMACSPEAK-KEYMAP and are accessed with the key `Control e'.  Thus, the
Emacspeak command "emacspeak-speak-line" is bound to `l' in keymap
EMACSPEAK-KEYMAP and can be accessed with the keystroke `Control-e l'.
<P>Here are some of the commands for reading text:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>`C-e c' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-char'</B><DD><P>Speak current character, using the phonetic alphabet.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e w' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-word'</B><DD><P>Speak current word.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e l' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-line'</B><DD><P>Speak current line.  With prefix `C-u', speaks the rest of the line from
point.  With negative prefix `C-u -', speaks from start of line to
point.  Voicifies if voice-lock-mode is on.  Indicates indentation
with a tone if audio indentation is in use.  Indicates position of
point with an aural highlight if option emacspeak-show-point is turned
on --see command `M-x emacspeak-show-point'.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e .' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-sentence'</B><DD><P>Speak the current sentence.
</DL>
<P>The second category of commands provided by Emacspeak report status of
various kinds.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>`C-e k' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-current-kill'</B><DD><P>Speak the current kill entry (which would be yanked by the next C-y).
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e =' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-current-column'</B><DD><P>State the column where point is.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e C-l' or
`M-x emacspeak-speak-line-number'</B><DD><P>State the line where point is.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e m' or `M-x emacspeak-speak-line-number'</B><DD><P>Speak the mode-line: the name of the buffer, how far point is into the
current buffer as a percentage, and the major mode.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e M' or `M-x emacspeak-speak-minor-mode-line'</B><DD><P>Speak the minor modes that are in effect.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e v' or `M-x emacspeak-speak-version'</B><DD><P>Announce the emacspeak version.
</DL>
<P>The third category of commands provided by Emacspeak manipulate the
state of the speech device.  The names of these commands start with
the common prefix `dtk-'.  Many of these commands take the
prefix `Control-e d'.  Thus, the command "dtk-set-rate" is bound to
`r' in keymap EMACSPEAK-DTK-SUBMAP and can be executed by pressing
`Control e d r'.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>`C-e s' or
`M-x dtk-stop'</B><DD><P>Stop speech now.  In addition, any command that causes speech output will
discard anything in the speech buffer.  
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d V' or `M-x emacspeak-dtk-speak-version'</B><DD><P>Use this to find out which version of the Dectalk firmware you have.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d I' or `M-x dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing'</B><DD><P>Toggle state of variable dtk-stop-immediately-while-typing.
As the name implies, if true then speech flushes immediately as you type.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d i' or `M-x emacspeak-toggle-audio-indentation'</B><DD><P>Toggle state of Emacspeak audio indentation.  Specifying the method of
indentation as `tone' results in the DECtalk producing a tone whose
length is a function of the line's indentation. Specifying `speak'
results in the number of initial spaces being spoken.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d k' or `M-x emacspeak-toggle-character-echo'</B><DD><P>Toggle state of  Emacspeak  character echo (that is, whether typed
characters are echoed).
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d w' or `M-x emacspeak-toggle-word-echo'</B><DD><P>Toggle state of  Emacspeak  word echo (initially on).
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d l' or `M-x emacspeak-toggle-line-echo'</B><DD><P>Toggle state of  Emacspeak  line echo (that is, whether typed text is
echoed after typing enter).
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d p' or `M-x dtk-set-punctuations'</B><DD><P>Set punctuation state. Possible values are `some', `all', or `none'.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d q' or `M-x dtk-toggle-quiet'</B><DD><P>Toggle state of the speech device between being quiet and talkative.
Useful if you want to continue using an emacs session that has
emacspeak loaded but wish to make the speech shut up.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d R' or `M-x dtk-reset-state'</B><DD><P>Restore sanity to the Dectalk.
Typically used after the Dectalk has been power cycled.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d SPC' or `M-x dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space'</B><DD><P>Toggle state of emacspeak that decides if we split text
purely by clause boundaries, or also include whitespace.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d r' or `M-x dtk-set-rate'</B><DD><P>Set speaking rate for the dectalk.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d s' or `M-x dtk-toggle-split-caps'</B><DD><P>Toggle split caps mode.  In split caps mode, a transition from lower
case to upper case is treated like the beginning of a new word.  This
is useful when reading Hungarian notation in program source code.
<P>
<DT><B>`C-e d v' or `M-x voice-lock-mode'</B><DD><P>Toggle Voice Lock mode (initially off).
When Voice Lock mode is enabled, text is voiceified as you type it, as
follows: 
<UL>
<LI>Comments are spoken in <CODE>voice-lock-comment-personality</CODE>;
(That is a variable whose value should be a personality name.)</LI>
<LI>Strings are spoken in <CODE>voice-lock-string-personality</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>Documentation strings are spoken in
<CODE>voice-lock-doc-string-personality</CODE>. </LI>
<LI>Function and variable names in
their defining forms are spoken in
<CODE>voice-lock-function-name-personality</CODE>.  </LI>
<LI>Certain other expressions are spoken in other personalities 
according to the value of the variable <CODE>voice-lock-keywords</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Emacspeak Introduction - Using the Help System</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>When you press C-h to get the help index, the screen will appear, but
Emacspeak will not speak the window.  The only thing spoken is "Type
one of the options listed or Space to scroll:".
<P>Here is the menu that Emacspeak is not speaking:

<P>Suppose you type "a", for command-apropos.
<P>The next spoken prompt is "Apropos command (regexp):"
<P>Now you type some word you think is part of an emacs command, like
"visit".
<P>The help system will display the first section of the help, but will
leave the cursor in the other window.  The spoken text is "Type C-x 1
to remove help window.  M-C-v to scroll the help."  At this point, I
think it's more helpful to move point to the other window with C-x o,
then you can use regular navigation commands to speak the help text.
You can delete the help window with C-x 0, which will also put point
back where it was.
<P>The complete menu displayed by help-for-help is also visible if you do
a describe function on help-for-help.  In a future version of
Emacspeak, Raman plans to add a message to that effect when the user
presses C-h ?
