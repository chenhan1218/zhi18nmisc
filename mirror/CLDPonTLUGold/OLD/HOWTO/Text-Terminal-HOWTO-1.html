<P> Much of the section "Physical Connection" is from Serial-HOWTO v.
1.11 (1997) by Greg Hankins (with his permission).  His "How Do I Set
Up A Terminal Connected To My PC?" was incorporated into v1.00 at
various places.  v1.09 has about 25 changes (and error corrections)
suggested by Alessandro Rubini who reviewed this HOWTO.  Jeremy Jon
Spykerman told me about using a keyboardless terminal as a console for
a monitorless PC (using ttysnoop).

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Future Plans: You Can Help</A>
</H2>

<P> Please let me know of any errors in facts, opinions, logic,
spelling, grammar, clarity, links, etc.  But first, if the date is
over a few months old, check to see that you have the latest version.
Please send me any info that you think belongs in this document.
<P>Starting with version 1.00, a first attempt was made to help
people set up terminals without recourse to a terminal manual.  Much
more is needed in this respect.  One way to solve this problem would
be if terminal manufacturers put their manuals on the Internet.  I
suggest that you encourage them to do so.  The task of providing
information on how to configure most terminals in this HOWTO is
daunting.  There are so many different terminals, but there are far
fewer models than there used to be in the 1980,s so the task is not
totally infeasible.
<P>Please send me any surplus terminal manuals which you may have,
especially on terminals made within the past 10 years (but I'll
accept older ones also).  Also, you might want to write up something
on a certain terminal to put in the Appendix D: Notes by Brand Name.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 New Versions of this HOWTO</A>
</H2>

<P> New versions of the Text-Terminal-HOWTO should be released every
month or two to browse and/or download at LDP mirror sites.  For a
list of mirror sites see: 
<A HREF="http://linuxdoc.org/mirrors.html">http://linuxdoc.org/mirrors.html</A>.  Various formats are
available.  If you only want to quickly check the date of the latest
version look at 
<A HREF="http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html">http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html</A>.  The
version your are currently reading is: v1.22, May 2001 .  New in recent 
versions:<BR>
v1.22 Clarity: 8-bit, ASCII, national replacement characters,
CP1252=MS-ANSI<BR>
v1.21 More on mgetty, getty-login sequence, agetty parity
problem, types of "terminal servers", parity set shows upper 128
chars., Correction: PCTerm doesn't work with MS DOS, troubleshooting:
no CD signal

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Terminology Used in this Document</A>
</H2>

<P> Configuration means the same as set-up.  While Linux commands take
options (using - symbols), options in a broader sense include various
other types of choices.  Install in the broad sense includes setting
up (configuring) software and hardware.  A statement that I suspect is
true (but may not be) ends with 2 question marks: ??  If you know for
sure, let me know. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 What is a Terminal ?</A>
</H2>

<P> A terminal consists of a screen and keyboard that one uses to
communicate remotely with a (host) computer.  One uses it just like it
was a personal computer but the terminal is remote from its host
computer (on the other side of the room or even on the other side of
the world).  Programs execute on the host computer but the results
display on the terminal screen.  Its computational ability is
relatively low (otherwise it would be a computer and not a terminal).
This computational ability is generally limited to the ability to
display what is sent to it (possibly including full-screen graphics)
and the ability to send to the host what is typed at the keyboard.
<P>In the days of mainframes from the mid 1970's to the mid 1980's, most
people used terminals to communicate with computers.  They typed in
programs, ran programs, wrote documents, issued printing commands,
etc.  A cable connected the terminal to the computer (often
indirectly).  It was called a terminal since it was located at the
terminal end of this cable.
<P>If you've been using Linux (except for X-Window use) with a computer
monitor and keyboard you already know what a terminal is because you
have been using one (or more precisely a "virtual terminal").  The
monitor (along with the keyboard) is emulating a terminal.  In
X-Windows the programs xterm, rxvt, and zterm emulate terminals.
<P>A real terminal is different from a monitor because it's a different
electronic setup.  A text terminal is often connected to a serial port
of the computer via a long cable.  Thus, in contrast to a monitor
which is usually located right next to the computer, a terminal may be
quite a distance away from its host computer.  The video card inside a
computer stores the video image seen on the monitor screen.  For a
terminal, the equivalent of this video card is built right into the
terminal but since text terminals are often monochrome without much
graphics, the capabilities of its "video card" are rather weak.  Also,
most text terminals do not have mice.
<P>In network client-server terminology, one might think that the
terminal is the client and that the host computer is the server.  The
terminal has been called a "thin client" by some.  But it is not
actually a "client" nor is the host a "server".  The only "service"
the host provides is to receive every letter typed at the keyboard and
react to this just like a computer would.  The terminal is like a
window into the computer just like a monitor (and keyboard) are.  You
may have already used virtual terminals in Linux (by pressing Left
Alt-F2, etc.).  A real terminal is just like running such a virtual
terminal but you run it on its own terminal screen instead of having
to share the monitor screen.  In contrast to using a virtual terminal
at the console (monitor), this allows another person to sit at the
real terminal and use the computer simultaneously with others.
