<H2><A NAME="s3">3. What is PostgreSQL ?</A></H2>

<P>PostgreSQL is a free database, complete 
source code is given to you and is an Object-Relational Database System 
targetting on ANSI ISO/SQL 1998, 92 and runs on 
diverse hardware platforms and Operating systems.
The ultimate objective and the final goal of PostgreSQL is to become 100 % 
compliant to ANSI/ISO SQL and also to become the number ONE open generic Database in the world. 
<P>PostgreSQL is pronounced as Post-gres-cue-el (Postgres-QL) and <B>not</B> Postgre-es-cue-el.
<P>Today, PostgreSQL is the <B>most advanced</B> system in the world and
it is surprising that many commercial database systems could not match 
the quality, features and
capabilities of PostgreSQL !! PostgreSQL is the joint effort of many
nations around the globe and is a project similar to <B>International
Space Station</B>. PostgreSQL will remain 
the <B>number one database system</B> for many decades 
into future since it is an open-source code system.
<P>The fundamental idea behind PostgreSQL is - once a module of code is written
than you should not waste even a milli-second of your time trying to re-invent it!!
<P>Informix Universal server (released 1997) is based on earlier version of
PostgreSQL because Informix bought
Illustra Inc. and integrated with Informix. Illustra database was 
based on Postgres (earlier version of PostgreSQL).
<P>PostgreSQL is an enhancement of the POSTGRES database management
system, a next-generation DBMS research prototype.  While
PostgreSQL retains the powerful data model and rich data types of
POSTGRES, it replaces the PostQuel query language with an
extended subset of SQL. 
<P>
<P>PostgreSQL development is being performed by a team of Internet
developers who all subscribe to the PostgreSQL development
mailing list. The current coordinator is Marc G. Fournier
<UL>
<LI>       
<A HREF="mailto:scrappy@postgreSQL.org">scrappy@postgreSQL.org</A></LI>
</UL>

This team is now responsible for all
current and future development of PostgreSQL.
Ofcourse, the database customer himself is the developer of PostgreSQL!
The development load is distributed among a very large
number of database end-users on internet.
<P>The authors of PostgreSQL 1.01 were Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen.
The original Postgres code, from
which PostgreSQL is derived, was the effort of many graduate
students, undergraduate students, and staff programmers and working
under the direction of Professor Michael Stonebraker at the
University of California, Berkeley.
<P>Millions of PostgreSQL is installed as Database servers, Web database servers and Application data servers. 
It is very sophisticated object relational database system (ORDBMS).
<P>PostgreSQL runs on Solaris, SunOS, HPUX, AIX, Linux, Irix, 
Digital Unix, BSDi,NetBSD, FreeBSD, SCO unix, NEXTSTEP, Unixware and 
all and every flavor of Unix. Port to Windows NT is done using 
Cygnus cygwin32 package.
<P>PostgreSQL and related items in this document are subject to the
