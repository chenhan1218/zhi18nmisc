<H2><A NAME="s15">15. Advanced Linux Routing</A></H2>

<P>This section is for all you people who either want to understand why the
whole system works or have a configuration that's so bizarre that you
need the low down to make it work.
<P>This section is completely optional. It's quite possible that this section
will be quite complex and really not intended for normal users. You have
been warned.
<P>FIXME: Decide what really need to go in here.
<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 How does packet queueing really work?</A>
</H2>

<P>This is the low-down on how the packet queueing system really works.
<P>Lists the steps the kernel takes to classify a packet, etc...
<P>FIXME: Write this.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2 Advanced uses of the packet queueing system</A>
</H2>

<P>Go through Alexey's extremely tricky example involving the unused bits
in the TOS field.
<P>FIXME: Write this.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3 Other packet shaping systems</A>
</H2>

<P>I'd like to include a brief description of other packet shaping systems
in other operating systems and how they compare to the Linux one. Since Linux
is one of the few OSes that has a completely original (non-BSD derived) TCP/IP
stack, I think it would be useful to see how other people do it.
<P>Unfortunately I have no experiene with other systems so cannot write this.
<P>FIXME: Anyone? - Martijn
