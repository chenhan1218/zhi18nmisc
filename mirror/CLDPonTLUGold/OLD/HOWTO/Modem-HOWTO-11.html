<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 Are You Ready to Dial Out ?</A>
</H2>

<P> Once you've plugged in your modem and know which serial port it's
on you're ready to try using it.  Before you try to get the Internet
on it or have people call in to you, you could first try something
simpler like dialing out to some number to see if your modem is
working OK.  Find a phone number that is connected to a modem.  If you
don't know what number to call, find out if a local library has a
phone number for an on-line catalog.
<P>Then make sure you are ready to phone.  Do you know what serial port
(such as ttyS2) your modem is on?  You should have found this out when
you io-irq configured your serial ports.  Have you decided what speed
you are going to use for this port?  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-14.html#speed_table">Speed Table</A> for a quick selection or 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-14.html#speed_">What Speed Should I Use with My Modem</A> for more details.  If
you have no clue of what speed to set, try setting it a few times
faster than the advertised speed of your modem.  Also remember that if
you see a menu where an option is "hardware flow control" and/or
"RTS/CTS" or the like, select it.  Is a live telephone cable plugged
in to your modem?  You may want to connect the cable to a real
telephone to make sure that it can produce a dial tone.
<P>Now you need to select a communication (dialing) program to use to
dial out.  Dialing programs include: minicom, seyon (X-windows), and
kermit.  See section 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-15.html#comms">Communications Programs</A>
about some communications programs.  Two examples are presented next:
<A HREF="#minicom_">Dialing Out with Minicom</A> and 
<A HREF="#kermit_">Dialing Out with Kermit</A><P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="minicom_"></A> <A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Dialing Out with Minicom </A>
 </H2>

<P> Minicom comes with most Linux distributions.  To configure it you
should be the root user.  Type "minicom -s" to configure.  This will
take you directly to the configuration (set-up) menus.  Alternatively
you could just run "minicom" and then type ^A to see the bottom status
line.  This shows to type ^A Z for help (you've already typed the ^A
so just type z).  From the help menu go to the Configuration menu.
<P>Most of the options don't need to be set for just simply dialing out.
To configure you have to supply a few basic items: the name of the
serial port your modem is on such as /dev/ttyS2 and the speed such as
115200.  These are set at the serial port menu.  Go to it and set
them.  Also (if possible) set hardware flow control (RTS/CTS).  Then
save them.  When typing in the speed, you should also see something
like "8N1" which you should leave alone.  It means: 8-bit bytes, No
parity, 1 stop-bit appended to each byte.  If you can't find the speed
you want, a lower speed will always work for a test.   Exit (hit
return) when done and save the configuration as default (dfl) using
the menu.  You may want to exit minicom and start it again so it can
now find the serial port and initialize the modem, or you could go to
help and tell minicom to initialize the modem.
<P>Now you are ready to dial.  But first at the main screen you get
after you first type "minicom" make sure there's a modem there by
typing AT and then hit the &lt;enter&gt; key.  It should display OK.
If it doesn't something is wrong and there is no point of trying to
dial.
<P>If you got the "OK" go back to help and select the dialing directory.
You may edit it and type in a phone number, etc. into the directory
and then select "dial" to dial it.  Alternatively, you may just dial
manually (by selecting "manual" and then type the number at the
keyboard).  If it doesn't work, carefully note any error messages and
try to figure out what went wrong.  
<P>

</H2>

<P> You can find the latest version of <CODE>kermit</CODE> at <CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/</A></CODE>.  For example, say your
modem was on <CODE>ttyS3</CODE>, and its speed was 115200 bps.  You would
do the following:

OK                                 ; modem should respond with this

<P>If your modem responds to <CODE>AT</CODE> commands, you can assume your modem 
is working correctly on the Linux side.  Now try calling another modem
by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ATDT7654321
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

where 7654321 is a phone number.  Use ATDP instead of ATDT if you have
a pulse line.  If the call goes through, your modem is working.
<P>To get back to the <CODE>kermit</CODE> prompt, hold down the Ctrl key, press 
the backslash key, then let go of the Ctrl key, then press the C key:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

Ctrl-\-C
(Back at linux)
C-Kermit>quit

<P>This was just a test using the primitive "by-hand" dialing method.  
The normal method is to let <CODE>kermit</CODE> do the dialing for you with 
its built-in modem database and automatic dialing features, for example 
using a US Robotics (USR) modem:
