<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Summary</A></H2>

<P>You got a new large disk. What to do? Well, on the software side:
use <CODE>fdisk</CODE> (or, better, <CODE>cfdisk</CODE>) to create partitions,
and then <CODE>mke2fs</CODE> to create a filesystem, and then <CODE>mount</CODE>
to attach the new filesystem to the big file hierarchy.
<P>You need not read this HOWTO since there are <EM>no</EM> problems
with large hard disks these days. The great majority of
apparent problems is caused by people who think there might
be a problem and install a disk manager, or go into <CODE>fdisk</CODE>
expert mode, or specify explicit disk geometries to LILO
or on the kernel command line.
<P>However, typical problem areas are: (i) ancient hardware,
(ii) several operating systems on the same disk, and sometimes
(iii) booting.
<P>Advice:
<P>For large SCSI disks: Linux has supported them from very early on.
No action required.
<P>For large IDE disks (over 8.4 GB): get a recent stable kernel
(2.0.34 or later). Usually, all will be fine now,
especially if you were wise enough not to ask the BIOS
for disk translations like LBA and the like.
<P>For very large IDE disks (over 33.8 GB): see
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-12.html#verylarge">IDE problems with 34+ GB disks</A> below.
<P>If LILO hangs at boot time, also specify
<CODE>
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-5.html#linear">linear</A></CODE> in the
configuration file <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE>.
(And if you did have <CODE>linear</CODE>, try without it.)
If you have a recent LILO (version 21.4 or later),
the keyword <CODE>lba32</CODE> will usually allow booting from
anywhere on the disk, that is, the 1024 cylinder limit is gone.
<P>There may be geometry problems that can be solved by giving
an explicit geometry to kernel/LILO/fdisk.
<P>If you have an old <CODE>fdisk</CODE> and it warns about
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-6.html#overlap">overlapping</A> partitions:
ignore the warnings, or check using <CODE>cfdisk</CODE> that really all is well.
<P>For HPT366, see the 
<A HREF="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b6506063/hpt366/">Linux HPT366 HOWTO</A>.
<P>If at boot time the kernel cannot read the partition table,
consider the possibility that UDMA66 was selected while
the controller or the cable or the disk drive did not
support UDMA66. In such a case every attempt to read will
fail, and reading the partition table is the first thing
the kernel does. Make sure no UDMA66 is used.
<P>If you think something is wrong with the size of your disk,
make sure that you are not confusing binary and decimal 
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-3.html#units">units</A>
,
and realize that the free space that <CODE>df</CODE> reports on an empty disk
is a few percent smaller than the partition size, because there
is administrative overhead.
<P>If for a removable drive the kernel reports two different sizes,
then one is found from the drive, and the other from the disk/floppy.
This second value will be zero when the drive has no media.
<P>Now, if you still think there are problems, or just are curious,
read on.
