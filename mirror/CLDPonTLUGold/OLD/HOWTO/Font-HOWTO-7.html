<H2><A NAME="s7">7. WYSIWYG Publishing and Fonts</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Introduction and Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>Installing fonts for WYSIWYG publishing on Linux is a relatively
complex task. It typically involves three steps:
<UL>
<LI>Make the font available to the X server</LI>
<LI>Make the font available to ghostscript</LI>
<LI>Make the font available to the application</LI>
</UL>

The main reason for the complexity is that 
the <EM>font printing system</EM> ( ghostscript ) is unrelated 
to the <EM>screen font system</EM>. In a way, Linux's left hand
does not know what it's right hand is doing.
This problem is nontrivial to solve, because it is possible that 
printer fonts and display fonts reside on different machines, so there
is no guarantee that all fonts the XClient uses are printable.
<P>The good news is that most WYSIWYG applications use what is a reasonable solution
to this problem. The solution involves constructing some kind of
mechanism that maps screen fonts to printer fonts ( this is the main issue.
There are also other issues, such as grouping bold, italic and roman variants
into ``families'' of fonts ).
Unfortunately, there is no standard way to do this. It seems that font management
standards which address this issue would greatly simplify the installation
of fonts into WYSIWYG publishing systems, because all applications could 
use a system-wide ( as opposed to application-specific ) configuration.
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Applixware</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two ways to install fonts into Applixware. One method 
involves using FontTastic, which is Applixware's ``private'' font
server. The other method involves editing Applixware's fontmap,
to use a font already installed on the system. Installing into the
font server is more convenient, but fonts installed in this manner may 
only be printed at 300 dpi.
<H3>FontTastic</H3>

<P>Using FontTastic is the easy way to do it. To install new fonts
like this, simply do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Run Applixware as root</LI>
<LI>Click on the <EM>tools</EM> menu.</LI>
<LI>Choose ``Font Installer''</LI>
<LI>Check ``OK'' in the popup dialog</LI>
<LI>Click the ``Catalogs'' menu and choose ``create''</LI>
<LI>Fill in the <EM>catalog name</EM> box. It 
doesn't matter what you put there. For the rest of this example,
we'll assume it's called ``foobar''</LI>
<LI>Select your foobar catalog from the catalog manipulations 
list.</LI>
<LI>From the ``Services'' menu, select
``install fonts into -&gt; FontTastic font server''</LI>
<LI>Make sure catalog foobar is selected in the catalogs list,
then press the ``select files'' button.</LI>
<LI>Use the select files dialog to select the fonts you want to
install. Press ``OK'' when you've selected the files.
For example, if you want to select arial.ttf in 
the directory /usr/share/fonts/ttfonts/, you would type 
<EM>/usr/share/fonts/ttfonts</EM> in the ``Current Directory''
dialog, then select arial.ttf from the files dialog box, then click
``OK''. Note that you can select multiple files, but they all must
come from the same directory.</LI>
<LI>You can edit your list by checking on the different fonts in the
list box and possibly removing or renaming them.</LI>
<LI>When you're ready, click the ``install fonts'' button. Then click
``OK''.</LI>
<LI>Go to the ``services'' menu and choose ``update''. Check ``OK''
on the annoying modal dialog, then choose exit from the services menu.
Exit applix. </LI>
<LI>Congrats, you're done ! The new fonts will be available when you
restart Applix.</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Using System Wide Fonts With Applixware</H3>

<P>This method is more involved,  but produces better results. I recommend
that this method is used for fonts that are really important, and that 
you use a lot. There are a few steps to this:
<H3>Make the fonts available to X</H3>

<P>This is explained 
<A HREF="Font-HOWTO-4.html#xfonts">in the previous section</A><H3>Make the fonts available to ghostscript</H3>

<P>This is explained in 
<A HREF="Font-HOWTO-5.html#ghostscript">in the previous section</A><H3>Edit the fontmap.dir</H3>

<P>This is the final step in making your fonts available to Applix, and 
also the most time consuming step. The file <EM>fontmap.dir</EM>
is in under the <EM>axdata/fontmetrics</EM> of your applix installation.
The purpose of this step is basically to tell applix which screen fonts
go with which outline fonts. This is in general a very nontrivial problem,
because the screen fonts are not always on the same computer that the 
application is installed.
<P>We describe how to add  fonts to fontmap.dir. In this example, we
add the font Baskerville Italic.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>First, we add a line that says 
FontRecord = Baskerville-Normal-Italic
In fact, the name we use in FontRecord is completely arbitrary.
However, the font record must be unique to the font. Because of
this, it's good practice to use the name that ghostscript
uses for the font. </LI>
<LI>Next, we a line that says
Family = Baskerville
The family name for a font is the name that appears 
in Applix's font selection menu. Typically, it is <EM>non-unique</EM>,
since bold, italic, roman and bold-italic variants of a font will
typically go under the same family.</LI>
<LI>If the font is either a bold, or italic variant, or both, we need to add the
following lines:
<PRE>
        Slant = 1 
        
</PRE>

if the font is italic, and
<PRE>
        Weight = 1 
        
</PRE>

if the font is bold.
If the font is bold <EM>and</EM> italic, we add both lines.
In this example, we need only add the line
<PRE>
        Slant = 1 
        
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>We add a line that looks like this:
<PRE>
        ScreenName = "-paradise-baskerville-medium-i-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1"
        
</PRE>

The screen name is the name that the X-server uses for the font. 
We can list font names containing the string ``bask'' by typing
<PRE>
        xlsfonts|grep -i bask
        
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Now we add a line that gives the name of the printer font:
PostScriptPrinterName = Baskerville-Normal-Italic</LI>
<LI>Next, we need to specify the location of the font metric file 
and the outline file
<PRE>
        MetricsFile = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvli.afm
        Type1FontFileName = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvli.pfb
        
</PRE>


If you are adding a TrueType file, you can use <CODE>ttf2pt1 </CODE>
to generate an <CODE>afm</CODE> file :
<PRE>
                ttf2pt1 -A foo.ttf - &gt; foo.afm
                
</PRE>

( or get the ttfutils package and use <CODE>ttf2afm</CODE> )
Then you use something like this:
<PRE>
        MetricsFile = /usr/share/fonts/misc/foo.afm
        
</PRE>

Do <EM>not</EM> include a <CODE>Type1FontFileName</CODE> directive --
let ghostscript take care of this.</LI>
</OL>
<P>That's it. Now after adding the whole family of fonts, you should 
have something like this:
<PRE>
        FontRecord = Baskerville-Normal
        Family = Baskerville
        ScreenName = "-paradise-baskerville-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1"
        PostScriptPrintName = Baskerville-Normal
        MetricsFile = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvl.afm
        Type1FontFileName = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvl.pfb

        FontRecord = Baskerville-Normal-Italic
        Family = Baskerville
        Slant = 1
        ScreenName = "-paradise-baskerville-medium-i-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1"
        PostScriptPrintName = Baskerville-Normal-Italic
        MetricsFile = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvli.afm
        Type1FontFileName = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvli.pfb

        FontRecord = Baskerville-Bold
        Family = Baskerville
        Weight = 1
        ScreenName = "-paradise-baskerville-bold-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1"
        PostScriptPrintName = Baskerville-Bold
        MetricsFile = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvlb.afm
        Type1FontFileName = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvlb.pfb     

        FontRecord = Baskerville-Bold-Italic
        Family = Baskerville
        Weight = 1
        Slant = 1
        ScreenName = "-paradise-baskerville-bold-i-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1"
        PostScriptPrintName = Baskerville-Bold-Italic
        MetricsFile = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvlbi.afm
        Type1FontFileName = /usr/share/fonts/misc/baskvlbi.pfb     
</PRE>
<P>
<P>It is possible to do more with this configuration file. The file itself 
has a <EM>glossary</EM> which explains the format of the configuration
file.
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Star Office</A>
</H2>

<P>Here, we cover Star Office 5.0. The procedure with Star Office 5.1 
is similar,
but the utility is called <CODE>spadmin</CODE>, not <CODE>psetup</CODE>.
It's worth mentioning up front that 
<A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~john_mcl/adding_fonts.html">John McLaughlin's page</A>
is an excellent source on this issue, and it inspired most
of what follows.
<P>Having tried both Star Office 5.0, and 5.1, I have found that Star Office
5.1 seems to give me less grief when adding new fonts. I was not succesful
adding true type fonts to Star Office 5.0, but it proved somewhat easier
with Star Office 5.1.
<H3>Backup Your Configuration Before you Start !</H3>

<P>It's good to make a backup in case you inadvertantly hose your 
configuration. Modifying fonts will impact several files in the
<CODE>xp3</CODE>.
You should definitely backup the file <CODE>xp3/psstd.fonts</CODE>. 
I recommend going further and backing up the whole <CODE>xp3</CODE>
directory. You can do this by cd-ing to your Star Office
directory, then using
<PRE>
        tar cvzf xp3.tgz xp3
        
</PRE>

to create a backup. To restore a backup,
delete the <CODE>xp3</CODE> directory and unpack the archive
<PRE>
        rm -rf xp3
        tar xvzf xp3.tgz
        
</PRE>
<H3>Adding Type1 Fonts to Star Office</H3>

<P>Adding Type1 fonts to Star Office is relatively simple.
If you want to use your TrueType fonts with Star Office 5.0,
the best thing to do is convert them to Type1 fonts, and then follow
the procedure outlined here. If you have Star Office 5.1, you 
might wish to use the proceedure for installing TrueType fonts
instead ( though it is somewhat more difficult ).
Firstly, do the usual thing -- make the font available to both X and 
ghostscript. Once this is done, the font can be installed into Star Office
using the <CODE>psetup</CODE> tool. The procedure is as follows:
<OL>
<LI>As root, run psetup ( or spadmin if you have Star Office 5.1 )</LI>
<LI>Press the ``add fonts'' button. </LI>
<LI>The easiest thing to do after 
this is press the ``initialize font paths'' button. This puts a
list of all fonts in your X font path in the list box. </LI>
<LI>Choose 
the directory containing the font you wish to install ( it should
be in the box ), and then press ``OK''. </LI>
<LI>Click the ``convert all font metrics button''.</LI>
</OL>

That's it. You're done. You can exit ( or click ``OK'' until it exits ). 
When you restart Star Office, you will have the new fonts.
<H3>Adding TrueType Fonts to Star Office</H3>

<P>Adding TrueType fonts to Star Office is 
nontrivial, but possible.
After some hard work, and long hours stareing at 
<A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~john_mcl/adding_fonts.html">John McLaughlin's page</A>
page, I finally got them working in Star Office 5.1.
Note that this does not work with version 5.0.
The following steps are appropriate it you are printing 
through ghostscript:
<UL>
<LI>Make the fonts available to X.</LI>
<LI>Make the fonts available to ghostscript.</LI>
<LI>You need to have <CODE>afm</CODE> files for the fonts you wish to
add. Use 
<PRE>
        ttf2pt1 -A foo.ttf - &gt; foo.afm
                
</PRE>

to create the <CODE>afm</CODE> files.
Alternatively, you can get the </LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~elflord/font_howto/ttfutils-0.2.tar.gz">ttfutils</A>
package 
and use <CODE>ttf2afm</CODE> The advantage of this 
is you can handle several at a time, eg 
<PRE>
        ttf2afm *.ttf
        
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Star Office needs <CODE>pfb</CODE> files corresponding 
to each <CODE>ttf</CODE> file. You can create them 
with the command
<PRE>
        touch foo.pfb
        
</PRE>

Actually, Star Office only uses these files for printing purposes.
And by enterring the font in the PPD, thus duping Star Office into
thinking the fonts are inside your printer ( when they're actually
inside ghostscript's rendering system ), you get around needing to
use these files. Star Office just seems to require that the 
<CODE>pfb</CODE> file exists to install the font.
        </LI>
<LI>    Now you can run <CODE>spadmin</CODE> and install the font(s).</LI>
<LI>    
Now add the fonts to the PPD file corresponding to your 
printer configuration. The name you use for the font should
be the same name Star Office uses for it, <EM>not</EM> the 
ghostscript font name. For example, if the font is 
<CODE>foobar.ttf</CODE> and the corresponding <CODE>afm</CODE> 
file is <CODE>foobar.afm</CODE>, you use the name
``foobar'' for the font in the PPD file. The entry 
should look something like this:
<PRE>
*Font cloistrk: Standard "(001.002)" Standard ROM
                
</PRE>

                        </LI>
</UL>
<P>On the other hand, if you are not printing from ghostscript,
you have different issues to deal with. In this case, 
tricking Star Office into thinking that your printer has the fonts
is a bad idea, because your printer does <EM>not</EM> have the
fonts in the ROM, so while <CODE>gv</CODE> will display the postscript
files nicely, your printer will not be able to print them.
If you have a postscript printer, the main differences are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Do not edit the PPD file.</LI>
<LI>Instead of using <CODE>touch foo.pfb</CODE> to create empty <CODE>pfb</CODE>
files, you need the <CODE>pfb</CODE> files to be Type42 postscript
fonts. A Type42 font is really a ``printer TrueType font''.
You don't really notice Type42 fonts even when you use them, because
most applications handle them transparently.
To create Type42 fonts, you use 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pub/jek/programs/ttfps.tar.gz">ttfps</A> to create the files. 
<PRE>
        ttfps foo.ttf foo.pfb
                        
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>There are some gotchas. Sometimes, Star Office might not choose the
screen font you like. It is sometimes worth checking 
<CODE>xp3/psstd.fonts</CODE> and possibly editing it to make sure
that Star Office is really using the font you had in mind for screen 
display.
Also, Star Office doesn't handle configuration problems gracefully.
If there's something wrong with your configuration, it's
possible that the word processor will not even start. This is why 
you should back up your <CODE>xp3</CODE> directory.
<H3>Under the Hood</H3>

<P>If you wish to install TrueType fonts in Star Office, you may need
to learn how Star Office handles things. When you run <CODE>spadmin</CODE>
or <CODE>psetup</CODE>, the following happens:
<UL>
<LI>Star Office makes symbolic links to the <CODE>pfb</CODE> outline 
files in your <CODE>xp3/pssoftfonts</CODE> directory.</LI>
<LI>The <CODE>afm</CODE> file is copied into the directory
<CODE>xp3/fontmetrics/afm/</CODE></LI>
<LI>An entry is added to the <CODE>xp3/psstd.fonts</CODE> file.
This file stores the names of all the screen fonts used by 
Star Office ( in particular, it maps the screen fonts to the outline
filenames ).</LI>
</UL>
<P>This is why it's good to simply backup the whole <CODE>xp3</CODE> directory --
it is the only convenient way to restore Star Office to a 
clean configuration.
