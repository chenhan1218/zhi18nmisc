<P>To install Quake on your Linux system, you'll need some flavor of the
official Quake distribution from id.  This will be either the retail
DOS/Windows CD-ROM that you bought at your favorite software store, or the
shareware version you downloaded from the net (see 
<A HREF="#quake-shareware">below</A> for details on acquiring the shareware
version).   Alternatively, if you've already got Quake installed on a
DOS/Windows machine, you can use the relevant files from that installation.

<P>
<H3>Create the Installation Directory ++</H3>

<P>The first thing you'll need to do is decide where you  want to install
Quake.  Lots of folks like to put it in <CODE>/usr/games/quake</CODE>.  Anal
system administrator that I am, I choose to install anything that's not
part of my Linux distribution under <CODE>/usr/local</CODE>.  So
for me, Quake goes in <CODE>/usr/local/games/quake</CODE>.  If you choose to
install somewhere else, please substitute the appropriate path wherever
<CODE>/usr/local/games/quake</CODE> is mentioned.
<P><B>Note to Redhat users:</B>  If you plan on installing QuakeWorld from the 
<CODE>rpm</CODE> packages, you should probably install Quake in
<CODE>/usr/local/games/quake</CODE>, since the <CODE>rpm</CODE>s install to this
directory by default.
<P>So go ahead and create the directory you'll install Quake in, and cd 
to it.  The rest of these instructions will assume that this is your 
current directory.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     mkdir /usr/local/games/quake
     cd /usr/local/games/quake
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Installing From a Quake CD ++</H3>

<P>If you're installing from a Quake CD-ROM, read on.  Otherwise you have 
permission to skip this section.
<P>There are at least two versions of the Quake CD in circulation.  I've got
one from the early days that has Quake version 1.01 on it.  Iv'e seen
other CDs that contain version 1.06.  You have 1.01 if you see files on
your CD called <CODE>quake101.1</CODE> and <CODE>quake101.2</CODE>.  If instead
you see a file called <CODE>resource.1</CODE>, you have a newer CD.
Mount your Quake CD now and determine which version you've
got.  In the example below, replace <CODE>/dev/cdrom</CODE> and
<CODE>/mnt/cdrom</CODE> with the device file and mount point appropriate for
your sysem:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
     ls /mnt/cdrom
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you have a <CODE>resource.1</CODE> file on your CD, you can skip
ahead to the next bullet.  For a version 1.01 CD, you'll need to download
the Quake shareware package to update the <CODE>.pak</CODE> files after the
installation.  The last bullet in this section explains this.

<UL>
<LI>Concatenate the two resource files from your CD to a single file 
on your hard disk:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     cat /mnt/cdrom/quake101.1 /mnt/cdrom/quake101.2 > resource.1
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>Now continue on to the next paragraph, but when I refer to
<CODE>/mnt/cdrom/resource.1</CODE>, you should use
<CODE>/usr/local/games/quake/resource.1</CODE> instead.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Now it's time to extract the Quake
files.  The <CODE>resource.1</CODE> file on your CD is really an lha archive
(lha is a file compression and archiving format like zip or tar).  We'll
use the <CODE>lha(1)</CODE> command to extract it.  If lha is not already
installed on your system, you can get it from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/compress/lha-1.00.tar.Z">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/compress/lha-1.00.tar.Z</A>.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     lha e /mnt/cdrom/resource.1
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     
When lha is done, your Quake directory will contain a bunch of new files.
A directory called <CODE>id1/</CODE> will also be created.  The files in this
directory are the only ones that are important for Linux Quake, so you can
safely remove everything else.  If you're totally new to Quake, or even if
you're not, you may want to hang on to the <CODE>*.txt</CODE> files.  On
my system, I throw all the readmes that accumulate into a <CODE>doc/</CODE> 
directory.  So:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     cd /usr/local/games/quake
     mkdir doc
     mv *.txt doc
     rm -f *
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI>If you installed from a version 1.01 CD, now you need to overwrite
your <CODE>id1/pak0.pak</CODE> file with the one from the Quake shareware
version.  Install the shareware version as described in 
<A HREF="#quake-shareware-install">Shareware Version Install</A>, only
install it in some temporary directory so you don't overwrite your real
Quake files.  When you've extracted all the shareware files, copy
the <CODE>id1/pak0.pak</CODE> file from the temporary shareware directory
to your <CODE>/usr/local/games/quake/id1</CODE> directory.  After that, you
can erase the temporary shareware files.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>That's it for installing from the CD.  You can jump ahead to section
"
<A HREF="#quake-linux-binaries">Installing the Linux Binaries</A>" now.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="quake-windows-copy"></A> DOS/Windows to Linux Install</H3>

<P>If you have Quake installed under Windows or DOS on a different machine, you
can transfer the files in <CODE>quake\id1\</CODE> to your Linux system via 
FTP or some other mechanism.  Keep in mind that the filenames on your 
Linux system must be in lower case for Quake to find them, so you may have
to rename them after the transfer.  Also note that it may be necessary to
delete your DOS/Win installation after you do this to remain in compliance
with the terms of id's software license.  It's not my fault if you do
something illegal.
<P>If your DOS/Win and Linux systems are on the same machine, you have two
options: copy the files from your DOS/Windows partition to your Linux
partition, or link to the necessary files from Linux.  Both options will
work equally well.  You just save around 50 megabytes of disk space when
you link instead of copy.
<P>Whatever you choose to do, start by cd'ing to your Quake directory and
creating a new directory below it called <CODE>id1</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     cd /usr/local/games/quake
     mkdir id1
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you want to copy the files from your DOS/Windows partition, do
something like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     cp /win95/games/quake/id1/*.pak id1
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI>To create links to your DOS/Windows Quake files instead, do this:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     cd id1
     ln -s /win95/games/quake/id1/*.pak .
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Replace <CODE>/win95/games/quake</CODE> with the correct path to
your DOS/Windows partition and Quake installation directory.

<A HREF="#quake-linux-binaries">Installing the Linux Binaries</A>".
<P>
<H3><A NAME="quake-shareware-install"></A> Shareware Version Install</H3>

<P>The single-episode shareware version of Quake is freely available for
download from id's ftp site.  It has all the features of the full version,
with a couple of major limitations:  You can't play QuakeWorld with it,
and you can't play custom or modified levels.
<P>Installing the shareware version of Quake isn't really much different than
installing from the CD.
<P>See section 
<A HREF="#quake-files">Download the Necessary Files</A> for
the location of the shareware distribution.
Download it and extract it to your Quake directory:

<P>Now you've got (among others) a file called <CODE>resource.1</CODE> that's
really an lha archive (lha is a file compression and archiving format like

<LI>X11 Quake allows you to run
Quake in a window on your X desktop.  It's the least exciting client, but

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Setting Permissions </A>
</H2>

<P>Quake and QuakeWorld servers can be run by any user.  The Quake clients,
however,  need access to your sound and graphics cards, which
requires privileges that normal users don't have.  One (bad) way to deal
with this is to always run Quake as root.  Responsible system
administrators will cringe at this filthy suggestion.  Making the Quake
binaries setuid root is a more acceptable solution.  Quake can then be run
by regular users and still have the privileges it needs to access the
sound and graphics devices.  Setuid presents a security risk, though.  A
clever user could exploit a bug or security hole in Quake to gain root
access to your system.  Of course, if you don't run a multi-user system,
this is may not be a big concern.
<P><CODE>squake</CODE> is the only Quake client that <EM>must</EM> be run with root 
permissions.  With a little work, you can run the X and GL clients without
setuid.  
<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-6.html#no-setuid">Running X and GL games without setuid</A>
in the Tips and Tricks section tells how to make this work.

<PRE>
     chown root squake

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 X11 Quake</A>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="quake-svgalib"></A> <A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 SVGAlib Quake </A>
</H2>

<P>Both squake and glquake require SVGAlib to run (glquake uses SVGAlib to
process keyboard and mouse input, in case you're wondering).   SVGAlib 
comes with most modern Linux distributions, and <B>must</B> be properly
configured before squake or glquake will run correctly.
<P><CODE>libvga.config</CODE> is SVGAlib's configuration file.  On
most systems you'll find it in either <CODE>/etc</CODE> or <CODE>/etc/vga</CODE>.
Make sure the mouse, monitor, and video card settings in this file are
correct for your system.  See the SVGAlib documentation for more details.
<P>If you don't already have SVGAlib on your system, download it from the 
location mentioned in 
<A HREF="#quake-files">the files section</A>
above.
If you have a RedHat 5.x or other glibc-based Linux distribution, see
<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-5.html#glibc">Glibc, RedHat 5.x, Debian 2 considerations</A> in the
Troubleshooting/FAQs section for important information about compiling
libraries for use with Quake. A precompiled libc5 SVGAlib binary is available

for those who don't want to deal with the hassle of compiling for libc5.
<P>You should run squake from a virtual console.  It won't run from X
unless you're root when you start it.  And running a game as the root user
is something that should be avoided.  So if you're in X, do a CTRL+ALT+F1,

<P>Hardware-accelerated OpenGL Quake is Quake the way God intended it to be.
There is no substitute, and once you've experienced it there's no going
back.  
<P>To run <CODE>glquake</CODE>, you need a 3D card with the Voodoo, Voodoo2 or Voodoo Rush 
graphics chipset on it.  There are specific issues to be dealt with if 
you have a Voodoo Rush card, and I won't go into them now because frankly,
I wouldn't know what I was talking about.  A future version of this HOWTO
will cover Rush issues (If somebody wants to write about Voodoo Rush
issues, I'll gladly include it here). 
<P>The SVGAlib, Glide, and Mesa libraries must all be installed and 
configured properly on your system for <CODE>glquake</CODE> to work.  The 
following sections will very briefly cover what you need to do to get
them going.

<H3>SVGAlib</H3>

<P>glquake uses SVGAlib to get input from the mouse and keyboard, so you'll
need to configure it as outlined in section 
<A HREF="#quake-svgalib">SVGAlib Quake</A>.
<P>
<H3>Glide </H3>

<P>Glide is a library that provides an API for programming 3Dfx based cards.
If you want the Mesa graphics library to use your 3Dfx card, you've gotta
have it. 
<P>The latest version of glide can always be found at 
<A HREF="http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html">http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html</A>.  Select the package(s)
appropriate for your system, and install according to the instructions on
the web page.
<P>Note that unless you download the 3Dfx device driver package in addition
to the Glide library, you will only be able to run Glide applications
(like GLQuake) as root.  Install the <CODE>/dev/3dfx</CODE> module and you
can play GLQuake as a regular user.
<P>Once you have glide installed, try out the test program that comes with
it.  Remember this program:  it's a good way to reset your display if you
ever have a glide application (like GLQuake) crash and leave your screen
switched off.  <B>NOTE: run this test from a VC, <EM>not</EM> X!</B> It's
possible for the test app to lose mouse and keyboard focus in X, and then
you'll have no way of shutting it down.

you can download the latest from  
<A HREF="ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa">ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa</A>

<P>After you've built it according to the instructions, you will have to do 
two things:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Remove your old Mesa installation.  If you previously installed a

<BLOCKQUOTE>
QuakeWorld is an Internet multi-player specific version of Quake.
While the original version of Quake can be played over the Internet, 
modem users - the majority of players, had less than
satisfactory play. Symptoms like excessive lag - actions actually
happening much later than you did them; packet loss - the game would
freeze and resume several seconds later; and various other difficulties
plagued users.  After realizing how many people played Quake on the
internet, and how many wanted to, but couldn't due to the play being
unsatisfactory, John Carmack of id Software decided to create a version of
Quake that was optimized for the average modem Internet player. This
Internet specific version does only 1 thing, play deathmatch games over a
TCP/IP network such as the Internet. It has no support for solo play, and
you can't do anything with out connecting to a special server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You need the full, registered or retail version of Quake to play
QuakeWorld, and a Linux QuakeWorld client.  QuakeWorld clients come in 
the same flavors (X11, SVGAlib and Mesa) as normal Quake, but they're
all bundled together in one package, so you only need to download one
file.  However, you've got four packages to choose from:
<UL>
<LI>a libc5 tar.gz package</LI>
<LI>a glibc tar.gz package</LI>
<LI>a libc5 rpm package</LI>
<LI>a glibc rpm package</LI>
</UL>
<P>Install just one of these packages.  Each contains the same files, they're
just linked against different libraries.  
Redhat 5.x users should choose the the glibc rpm package.  Users of glibc
based systems without rpm support should use the glibc tar package.  The 
libc5 rpm is for Redhat distributions prior to 5.0 and other distributions
that use the rpm package format.  The libc5 tar.gz package is for 
Slackware and everyone else.
<P>See the 
<A HREF="#quake-files">Download the Necessary Files</A> section
for the location of the Linux Quakeworld files.
<P>The prerequisites and configuration for these binaries are the same as for
Quake, so refer to the previous sections for help on setting up SVGAlib or
glide/Mesa.
<P>
<H3>Installing the RPM packages ++</H3>

<P>Installation of the rpm packages should be as simple as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P><CODE>qwcl</CODE>, <CODE>glqwcl</CODE> and <CODE>glqwcl.glx</CODE> will be installed
setuid root so that they can access the graphics devices on your system.

<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-6.html#no-setuid">Running X and GL games without      setuid</A> below.
<P>Rpm may complain that it can't find <CODE>libglide2x.so</CODE>.  The
Glide library is only necessary if you have a 3Dfx card and want
to run QuakeWorld in GL mode (<CODE>glqwcl</CODE>).  If you don't
plan to use the GL mode, you can override the glide dependency
with the <CODE>--nodeps</CODE> option:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H3>Installing the tar.gz packages ++</H3>

<P>To install, just untar the file in your Quake directory.  Do it as root

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     cd /usr/local/games/quake

<UL>
<LI><B>lib3dfxgl.so</B> 
<A NAME="qw-3dfxgl"></A>  **
<P>With Quakeworld version 2.30, an alternative to the Mesa library is
available.  <CODE>lib3dfxgl.so</CODE> is a mini-GL driver optimized
for Quake that provides slightly better framerates than Mesa.
This is a port of a driver that 3Dfx developed for Quake
under Windows, and apparently not all of its features work
properly yet.  So hopefully we can expect its performance to
improve with time.
<P>Like Mesa, <CODE>lib3dfxgl.so</CODE> requires Glide in order to
access your 3Dfx card.  The Quakeworld packages come with a script,
<CODE>glqwcl.3dfxgl</CODE> for running Quakeworld with this
library on glibc systems.  The next paragraph explains how to run
Quakeworld with <CODE>lib3dfxgl.so</CODE> on a libc5 system.  On a
glibc system in order for this script to work,the <CODE>glqwcl</CODE>
executable <B>must not be setuid</B>, nor should you run it as
root.  <CODE>glqwcl</CODE> will silently load Mesa rather than
<CODE>lib3dfxgl.so</CODE> if it runs with root permissions.  This
non-root requirement implies that you have the <CODE>/dev/3dfx</CODE>
driver installed.  
<P>On a libc5 system, you need to create a symbolic link to <CODE>lib3dfxgl.so</CODE>
called <CODE>libMesaGL.so.2</CODE> like so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     cd /usr/local/games/quake
     ln -sf lib3dfxgl.so libMesaGL.so.2
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Then start Quakeworld from a script that tells
<CODE>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> to look in the current directory:
<HR>
<PRE>
     #!/bin/sh

     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ./glqwcl $*
     
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>You can tell which driver is being loaded by looking for output
like the following in your console as Quakeworld starts:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     GL_VENDOR: 3Dfx Interactive Inc.
     GL_RENDERER: 3Dfx Interactive Voodoo^2(tm)
     GL_VERSION: 1.1
     GL_EXTENSIONS: 3DFX_set_global_palette WGL_EXT_swap_control GL_EXT_paletted_texture GL_EXT_shared_texture_palette GL_SGIS_multitexture
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If <CODE>GL_VENDOR</CODE> says <CODE>Brian Paul</CODE> rather than
<CODE>3Dfx Interactive Inc.</CODE>, that means Mesa is still being
used rather than the miniport dirver.
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>glqwcl.glx</B> **
<P>
<P><CODE>glqwcl.glx</CODE> is linked against standard OpenGL libraries
instead of Mesa.  This allows Quakeworld to run on other 3D
hardware that is supported by other OpenGL implementations.  At
this time, I dont' know of any OpenGL implementations that
support hardware other than 3Dfx, but this renderer ensures that
when they appear, we'll be able to play Quakeworld with them.
<P>This is a GLX application, and as such, must be run from X.
<P>You can use this client with Mesa/3Dfx if you install Mesa and
Glide as explained in the previous section, then set the
<CODE>$MESA_GLX_FX</CODE> environment variable to "fullscreen" before
you run <CODE>quake2</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     export MESA_GLX_FX=fullscreen
     ./glqwcl.glx +_windowed_mouse 1
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Why the <CODE>+_windowed_mouse 1</CODE> option?  Remember that
this is an X application which happens to use your 3Dfx card.
Even though the display takes up your entire screen, Quakeworld is
stil running in a window.  This means that if you're not
<EM>very</EM> careful, you could move the mouse pointer outside
the Quakeworld window, and Quakeworld will suddenly stop responding
to mouse and keyboard input.  <CODE>+_windowed_mouse 1</CODE>
avoids this problem by telling <CODE>glqwcl.glx</CODE> to grab the mouse
and not let it move outside its window.
