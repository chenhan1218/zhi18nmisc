If you have several operating systems on your disks, then each
uses one or more disk partitions.  A disagreement on where these
partitions are may have catastrophic consequences.
<P>
<A NAME="partitiontable"></A> 
The MBR contains a <I>partition table</I> describing where the
(primary) partitions are.  There are 4 table entries, for 4
primary partitions, and each looks like
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
struct partition {
        char active;    /* 0x80: bootable, 0: not bootable */
        char begin[3];  /* CHS for first sector */
        char type;
        char end[3];    /* CHS for last sector */
        int start;      /* 32 bit sector number (counting from 0) */
        int length;     /* 32 bit number of sectors */
};
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

(where CHS stands for Cylinder/Head/Sector).
<P>This information is redundant: the location of a partition
is given both by the 24-bit <CODE>begin</CODE> and <CODE>end</CODE> fields,
and by the 32-bit <CODE>start</CODE> and <CODE>length</CODE> fields.
<P>Linux only uses the <CODE>start</CODE> and <CODE>length</CODE> fields, and can
therefore handle partitions of not more than 2^32 sectors,
that is, partitions of at most 2 TiB.  That is thirty times
larger than the disks available today, so maybe it will be
enough for the next six years or so.
(So, partitions can be very large, but there is a serious
restriction in that a file in an ext2 filesystem on hardware
with 32-bit integers cannot be larger than 2 GiB.)
<P>DOS uses the <CODE>begin</CODE> and <CODE>end</CODE> fields, and uses the
BIOS INT13 call to access the disk, and can therefore only
handle disks of not more than 8.4 GB, even with a translating
BIOS. (Partitions cannot be larger than 2.1 GB because of
restrictions of the FAT16 file system.) The same holds for
Windows 3.11 and WfWG and Windows NT 3.*.
<P>Windows 95 has support for the Extended INT13 interface, and
uses special partition types (c, e, f instead of b, 6, 5)
to indicate that a partition should be accessed in this way.
When these partition types are used, the <CODE>begin</CODE> and <CODE>end</CODE> fields
contain dummy information (1023/255/63).
Windows 95 OSR2 introduces the FAT32 file system (partition type
b or c), that allows partitions of size at most 2 TiB.
<P>What is this nonsense you get from <CODE>fdisk</CODE> about `overlapping'
partitions, when in fact nothing is wrong?
Well - there is something `wrong': if you look at the <CODE>begin</CODE>
and <CODE>end</CODE> fields of such partitions, as DOS does, they overlap.
(And that cannot be corrected, because these fields cannot store
cylinder numbers above 1024 - there will always be `overlap'
as soon as you have more than 1024 cylinders.)
However, if you look at the <CODE>start</CODE> and <CODE>length</CODE> fields,
as Linux does, and as Windows 95 does in the case of partitions
with partition type c, e or f, then all is well.
So, ignore these warnings when <CODE>cfdisk</CODE> is satisfied and you
have a Linux-only disk. Be careful when the disk is shared with DOS.
Use the commands <CODE>cfdisk -Ps /dev/hdx</CODE> and <CODE>cfdisk -Pt /dev/hdx</CODE>
to look at the partition table of <CODE>/dev/hdx</CODE>.
