<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 A Quick Primer on LaTeX/TeX fonts</A>
</H2>

<P>Adding fonts to TeX and LaTeX is a somewhat complex procedure. However, like
a lot of things, it's easy if you know how to do it.
Some fonts are distributed in metafont format, and some in Type1 format. 
Usually, the Type1 formats are more easily available. However, metafont fonts have 
the distinct advantage that they can adjust their shape at different sizes,
while Type1 and TrueType fonts at different point sizes are simply magnified
or reduced versions of precisely the same shape. The main reason why this feature
is desirable is that ideally, fonts should be ( relatively ) wider at smaller
sizes and narrower at larger sizes.
<P>For this discussion, we focus on Type1 fonts, since they are more widely
available, and more problematic to install.
<P>Here's a quick primer on LaTeX fonts.         LaTeX uses the following 
types of font files for handling Type1 fonts:
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>.pl</CODE> -- property list. This is a human readable version of a 
tex font metric file.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>.vpl</CODE> -- virtual property list. Human readable version of a 
virtual font file.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>.fd</CODE> -- font definition. Used to define a <EM>family</EM> of
fonts.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>.tfm</CODE>  -- tex font metric. This is a metric file, as explained
in the glossary. It is completely analogous to the <CODE>.afm</CODE> files used
by Type1 fonts. TeX needs the font metrics to properly layout the page.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>.vf</CODE> -- virtual font. These files contain encoding details, and
act as interpreters. TeX treats them as fonts. For example, 
Imagine that there's some wacky font foobar-exp.pfb which consists 
of a few ( say 20 ) alternate characters, and there's a virtual font 
which uses a few of these alternate characters ( and it gets the
rest of the characters from font foobar.pfb ).
Dvips might say
``I want character 65 of virtual font foo.vf''. Dvips knows that 65 is always
an ``a'' in TeX's scheme. Then the virtual font maps TeX's request to 
a request for character 14 of the Type1 font foobar.pfb ( which might 
be the alternate ``a'' in the Type1 font foobar.pfb ). The virtual font 
mechanism is very flexible and allows fonts to be constructed from many 
different font files. This is useful when using fonts such as adobe's
``expert'' fonts.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>.pk</CODE> -- a device dependent bitmap font. These are usually constructed
on an as-needed basis ( they are renderings of Type1 and metafont fonts ). 
They are typically high resolution ( about 300-1200dpi ),
and are intended to be rendered on a printer. Because of their high resolution,
and the fact that each point size of each font requires a <CODE>.pk</CODE> file,
they require a lot of disk space, so they are cached, but not stored.</LI>
<LI><CODE>.mf</CODE> -- metafont files. Metafont is a graphics programming language
widely used for font design ( though it can also be used for graphics ). 
It has many advantages over TrueType and Type1 schemes. However, it's main
weakness is that it is not as ubiquitous as TrueType or Type1 ( and it is also
not terribly well suited to WYSIWYG publishing. Of course, this isn't a 
major disadvantage when TeX is your typesetting system. )
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>It's good to know your way around the TeX directory structure. Here are
the main directories you'll need to know about:
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>$TEXMF/fonts</CODE>  -- the main font directory</LI>
<LI> <CODE>$TEXMF/fonts/type1</CODE> -- the type1 font directory</LI>
<LI> <CODE>$TEXMF/fonts/type1/foundry</CODE> -- the directory for the shape files in a given foundry</LI>
<LI> <CODE>$TEXMF/fonts/type1/foundry/fontname</CODE> -- contains the font called <EM>name</EM>. 
The <EM>name</EM> is usually plain English, and needn't follow TeX's cryptic
naming scheme for fonts.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>$TEXMF/fonts/afm/foundry/fontname</CODE> -- the directory containing the <CODE>afm</CODE>
files corresponding to the font <CODE>name</CODE> belonging to foundry <CODE>foundry</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>  <CODE>$TEXMF/fonts/tfm/foundry/fontname</CODE> -- analogous to the <CODE>afm</CODE> directory,
but contains <CODE>tfm</CODE> files instead.</LI>
<LI><CODE>$TEXMF/fonts/vf/foundry/fontname</CODE> -- similar to the above, but contains the virtual fonts.</LI>
<LI><CODE>$TEXMF/fonts/source/foundry/fontname</CODE> -- similar to the above, but contains metafont files.</LI>
<LI><CODE>$TEXMF/dvips/config/psfonts.map</CODE> -- fontmap file for dvips. This file is similar
in both function and format to ghostscript's Fontmap file.</LI>
<LI><CODE>$TEXMF/tex/latex/psnfss</CODE> -- this is where all the font definition files go.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Adding Type1 fonts</A>
</H2>

<H3>Naming the fonts</H3>

<P>First, you need to appropriately name your fonts.
See the fontinst documentation on your system for instructions 
on how to name fonts ( it should be fontinst subdirectory of the
directory containing your tetex documentation ).
To make a long story very short, the naming scheme is 
<CODE>FNW{V}E{n}</CODE> where:
<UL>
<LI>F is a one-letter abbreviation for the foundry ( m = monotype, p = adobe, 
b = bitstream, f = free )</LI>
<LI>N is a two letter abbreviation for the font name 
( for example, ag = ``avant garde'' )</LI>
<LI>W is the font weight ( r = regular, b = bold, l = light d = demibold )</LI>
<LI>V is an optional slope variant ( i = italic , o = oblique )</LI>
<LI>E is an abbreviation for the encoding ( almost always <CODE>8a</CODE> which is 
adobe standard encoding ).</LI>
<LI>N is an optional width variant ( n = narrow )</LI>
</UL>

For example, the font Adobe Garamond demibold is <CODE>pgad8a</CODE>.
<H3>Creating the virtual fonts and tex font metrics</H3>

<P>Now you can run <CODE>fontinst</CODE> as follows:
<PRE>
        latex `kpsewhich fontinst.sty`
        
</PRE>

then you type at the prompt:
<PRE>
        \latinfamily{font_name}{}\bye
        
</PRE>

where <CODE>font_name</CODE> is the first three letters of your 
font file name ( for example, <CODE>pad</CODE> for adobe garamond ).
Now <CODE>fontinst</CODE> will generate a number of files -- 
font description files, property list files and virtual property
list files. It also generates a lot of <CODE>.mtx</CODE> files. These
are created by <CODE>fontinst</CODE>, but you don't need to use them.
You need to convert the property lists and virtual property lists
to metrics and virtual fonts. This is done using the utilities 
<CODE>vptovf</CODE> and <CODE>pltotf</CODE>.
<PRE>
        for X in *.pl; do pltotf $X; done
        for X in *.vpl; do vptovf $X; done
        
</PRE>

Then remove the old <CODE>vpl</CODE>, <CODE>pl</CODE> and <CODE>mtx</CODE> files.
<H3>Configure dvips</H3>

<P>You will need to edit your dvips config file, <CODE>psfonts.map</CODE>.
The best way to explain the format of the file is to give an example.
<PRE>
        
     marr8r          ArialMT &lt;8r.enc &lt;farr8a.pfa
     marbi8r         Arial_BoldItalicMT &lt;8r.enc &lt;farbi8a.pfa
     marb8r          Arial_BoldMT &lt;8r.enc &lt;farb8a.pfa
     marri8r         Arial_ItalicMT &lt;8r.enc &lt;farri8a.pfa
     marr8rn         Arial_Narrow &lt;8r.enc &lt;farr8an.pfa
        
</PRE>

The <CODE>8r.enc</CODE> is simply there to inform dvips of the encoding scheme 
used ( in all our examples, it's 8r, because of the way <CODE>fontinst</CODE> 
constructs the virtual fonts ). The leftmost column is the font name TeX
uses. The second column is the real name of the font, which is hardcoded
into the font file ( this name can be 
deduced by opening the <CODE>afm</CODE> file in a text editor, and looking 
for the <CODE>FontName</CODE> directive ). The last column is the filename 
of the shape file corresponding with the font. It is not necessary to
provide a directory path -- tex knows where to look.
<H3>Test the font</H3>

<P>Try running latex on a document like this:
<PRE>
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
        \usefont{T1}{pga}{m}{n}\selectfont
        \huge
        Testing a new font \dots the quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dogs
\end{document} 
         
</PRE>

where you replace <CODE>pga</CODE> with the outline of your font.
If this works, you are almost done. All you have to do now is put all the 
files in the right directories ( as explained in the primer ), then 
run 
<PRE>
         texconfig rehash
         
</PRE>

so that tex can update the directory lists.
<H3>Create a .sty file</H3>

<P>You may want to create a .sty file so that you can more easily use 
fonts. Use the files in <CODE>$TEXMF/tex/latex/psnfss</CODE> as a template.
