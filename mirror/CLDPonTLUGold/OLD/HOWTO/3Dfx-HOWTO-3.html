<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Installation</A></H2>

<P>Configuring Linux to support 3Dfx accelerators involves the
following steps:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Installing the board.</LI>
<LI>Installing the Glide distribution.</LI>
<LI>Compiling, linking and/or running the application.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The next sections will cover each of these steps in detail.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Installing the board</A>
</H2>

<P>Follow the manufacturer's instructions for installing the hardware or
have your dealer perform the installation.
It should not be necessary to select settings for IRQ, DMA channel,
either Plug&amp;Pray (tm) or factory defaults should work. The
add-on boards described here are memory mapped devices and do
not use IRQ's. The only kind of conflict to avoid 
is memory overlap with other devices.
<P>As 3Dfx does not develop or sell any boards, do not contact
them on any problems. 
<P>
<H3>Troubleshooting the hardware installation</H3>

<P>To check the installation and the memory mapping, do 
<CODE>cat /proc/pci</CODE>. The output should contain something like
<HR>
<PRE>
  Bus  0, device  12, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: S3 Inc. Vision 968 (rev 0).
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 11.  
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf4000000.

  Bus  0, device   9, function  0:
    Multimedia video controller: Unknown vendor Unknown device (rev 2).
      Vendor id=121a. Device id=1.
      Fast devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfb000000.
</PRE>
<HR>

for a Diamond Monster 3D used with a Diamond Stealth-64. Additionally
a <CODE>cat /proc/cpuinfo /proc/meminfo</CODE> might be helpfull for
tracking down conflicts and/or submitting a bug report.
<P>With current kernels, you will probably get a boot warning
like
<HR>
<PRE>
Jun 12 12:31:52 hal kernel: Warning : Unknown PCI device (121a:1).
Please read include/linux/pci.h 
</PRE>
<HR>

which could be safely ignored. If you happen to have a board
not very common, or have encountered a new revision, you should
take the time to follow the advice in <CODE>/usr/include/linux/pci.h</CODE>
and send all necessary information
to
<A HREF="mailto:linux-pcisupport@cao-vlsi.ibp.fr">linux-pcisupport@cao-vlsi.ibp.fr</A>.
<P>If you experience any problems with the board, you should
try to verify that DOS and/or Win95 or NT support works. You
will probably not receive any useful response from a
board manufacturer on a bug report or request regarding
Linux. Having dealt with the Diamond support e-mail
system, I would not expect useful responses for other
operating systems either. 
<P>
<H3>Configuring the kernel</H3>

<P>There is no kernel configuration necessary, as long as PCI
support is enabled.
The 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Linux Kernel HOWTO</A> should be consulted for the details of
building a kernel.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Configuring devices</H3>

<P>The current drivers do not (yet) require any special devices.
This is different from other driver developments 
(e.g. the sound drivers, where you will find 
a <CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE> and <CODE>/dev/audio</CODE>). The
driver uses the <CODE>/dev/mem</CODE> device which should 
always be available. In consequence, you need to use
<CODE>setuid</CODE> or root privileges to access the 
accelerator board. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Setting up the Displays</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two possible setups with add-on boards. You
could either pass-through the video signal from your
regular VGA board via the accelerator board to the
display, or you could use two displays at the same time.
Rely to the manual provided by the board manufacturer
for details. Both configurations have been tried with
the Monster 3D board.
<P>
<H3>Single screen display solution</H3>

<P>This configuration allows you to check basic operations
of the accelerator board - if the video signal is not
transmitted to the display, hardware failure is possible.
<P>Beware that the video output signal might deteoriate
significantly if passed through the video board. To
a degree, this is inevitable. However, reviews have
complained about below-average of the cables provided
e.g. with the Monster 3D, and judging from the one I
tested, this has not changed.
<P>There are other pitfalls in single screen configurations.
Switching from the VGA display mode to the accelerated 
display mode will change resolution and refresh rate as
well, even if you are using 640x480 e.g. with X11, too.
Moreover, if you are running X11, your application is
responsible for demanding all keyboard and mouse events,
or you might get stuck because of changed scope and exposure
on the X11 display (that is effectively invisible when the
accelerated mode is used) You could use SVGA console mode
instead of X11.
<P>If you are going to use a single screen configuration and
switch modes often, remember that your monitor hardware
might not enjoy this kind of use. 
<P>
<P>
<H3>Single screen dual cable setup</H3>

<P>Some high end monitors (e.g. the EIZO F-784-T)
come with two connectors, one with 5 BNC connectors
for RGB, HSync, VSync, the other e.g. a regular VGA
or a 13W3 Sub-D VGA.
These displays usually also feature a front panel
input selector to safely switch from one to the
other. It is thus possible to use e.g. a VGA-to-BNC
cable with your high end 2D card, and a VGA-to-13W3
Sub-D cable with your 3Dfx, and effectively run dual
screen on one display.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Dual screen display solution</H3>

<P>The accelerator board does not need the VGA input signal.
Instead of routing the common video output through the
accelerator board, you could attach a second monitor to
its output, and use both at the same time. This solution
is more expensive, but gives best results, as your main
display will still be hires and without the signal
quality losses involved in a pass-through solution. In
addition, you could use X11 and the accelerated full
screen display in parallel, for development and debugging.
<P>A common problem is that the accelerator board will not
provide any video signal when not used. In consequence,
each time the graphics application terminates, the
hardware screensave/powersave might kick in depending
on your monitors configuration. Again, your hardware
might not enjoy being treated like this. You should
use
<HR>
<PRE>
setenv SST_DUALSCREEN 1
</PRE>
<HR>

to force continued video output in this setup.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Installing the Glide distribution</A>
</H2>

<P>The Glide driver and library are provided as a single
compressed archive. Use <CODE>tar</CODE> and <CODE>gzip</CODE>
to unpack, and follow the instructions in the
README and INSTALL accompanying the distribution.
Read the install script and run it. Installation puts
everything in /usr/local/glide/include,lib,bin and sets
the ld.conf to look there. Where it installs and setting
ld.conf are independent actions. If you skip the ld.conf
step then you need the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
<P>You will need to install the header files in a location
available at compile time, if you want to compile your own
graphics applications. If you do not want to use the
installation as above (i.e. you insist on a different
location), make sure that any application could access
the shared libary at runtime, or you will get a response
like
<CODE>can't load library 'libglide.so'</CODE>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Using the detect program</H3>

<P>There is a <CODE>bin/detect</CODE> program in the distribution
(the source is not available). You have to run it as root,
and you will get something like
<HR>
<PRE>
slot  vendorId   devId   baseAddr0  command  description

as a result. If you do not have root privileges, the program will
bail out with
<HR>
<PRE>
Permission denied: Failed to change I/O privilege. Are you root?
</PRE>
<HR>

output might come handy for a bug report as well.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Using the test programs</H3>

<P>Within the Glide distribution, you will find a folder with
test programs. Note that these test programs are under
3Dfx copyright, and are legally available for use only
if you have purchased a board with a 3Dfx chipset. See
the LICENSE file in the distribution, or 
their web site
<A HREF="http://www.3dfx.com/">www.3dfx.com</A> for details.
<P>It is recommend to compile and link the test programs even
if there happen to be binaries in the distribution. Note
that some of the programs will requires some files
like <CODE>alpha.3df</CODE> from the distribution to be available
in the same folder. 
All test programs use the 640x480 screen resolution. Some
will request a veriety of single character inputs, others
will just state <CODE>Press A Key To Begin Test</CODE>. Beware
of loss of input scope if running X11 on the same screen
at the same time.
<P>See the README.test for a list of programs, and other details.
