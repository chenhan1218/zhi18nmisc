<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Fonts 101 -- A Quick Introduction to Fonts</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Types of fonts</A>
</H2>

<H3>Bitmap Fonts</H3>

<P>A bitmap is a matrix of dots. Bitmap fonts are represented in precisely
this way -- as matrices of dots. Because of this, they are
<EM>device dependent</EM> -- they are only useful at a particular 
resolution. A 75 DPI screen bitmap font is still 75 DPI on your 1200 DPI 
printer.
<P>There are two types of bitmap fonts -- bitmap printer fonts, such as
the <CODE>pk</CODE> fonts generated by dvips, and bitmap screen fonts,
used by X and the console. The bitmap screen fonts typically have 
a <CODE>bdf</CODE> or <CODE>pcf</CODE> extension. Bitmap screen 
fonts are most useful
for terminal windows, consoles and text editors, where the lack of
scalability and the fact that they are unprintable is not an issue.
<H3>Type1 Fonts</H3>

<P>The Type1 font standard was devised by Adobe, and Type1 fonts are
supported by Adobe's postscript standard. Because of this, they are
also well supported under linux. They are supported by X and 
ghostscript. Postscript fonts have traditionally been the choice 
of font for anything on UNIX that involves printing.
<P>Typically, a UNIX Type1 font is distributed as an <CODE>afm </CODE>
( adobe font metric ) file, and an outline file, which 
is usually a <CODE>pfb</CODE> ( printer font binary ) or 
<CODE>pfa</CODE> ( printer font ascii ) 
file. The outline file
contains all the glyphs, while the metric file 
contains the metrics. 
<P>Type 1 fonts for other platforms may be distributed in different
formats. For example, postscript fonts for windows often use a different
format ( <CODE>pfm</CODE> ) for the metric file.
<H3>Type3 fonts</H3>

<P>These fonts are distributed in a similar manner to Type1 files --
in groups of <CODE>afm</CODE> font metrics, and <CODE>pfa</CODE> files.
While they are supported by the postscript standard, they are not 
supported by X, and hence have limited use.
<H3>TrueType fonts</H3>

<P>True type fonts were developed by Apple. They made the format available
to Microsoft, and succesfully challenged Adobe's grip on the font 
market. 
True type fonts store the metric and shape information in a single
file ( usually one with a <CODE>ttf</CODE> extension ). Recently,
font servers have been developed that make TrueType available 
to X. And postscript and ghostscript have supported TrueType fonts
for some time. Because of this, TrueType fonts are becoming more 
popular on linux.
<H3>Type42 Fonts </H3>

<P>Type42 fonts are actually just TrueType fonts with headers that enable
them to be rendered by a postscript interpreter. Most applications,
such as ghostscript and SAMBA handle these fonts transparently. However,
if you have a postscript printer, it may be necessary to explicitly 
create Type42 font files.
<H3>Type1 vs TrueType -- a comparison</H3>

<P>Despite the historical feuding between the proponents to Type1 and TrueType
fonts, both have a lot in common. Both are scalable outline fonts.
Type1 fonts use cubic as opposed to quadratic curves for the glyphs.
This is in theory at least a slight advantage since they include 
all the curves available to TrueType fonts. In practice, it makes 
very little difference. 
<P>TrueType fonts have the apparent advantage that their support for 
hinting is better ( Type1 fonts do have hinting functionality, but it 
is not as extensive as that of TrueType fonts ). 
However, this is only an issue on low resolution
devices, such as screens ( the improved hinting makes no discernable
difference on a 600dpi printer, even at small point sizes. )
The other point that makes this apparent advantage somewhat 
questionable is the fact that well hinted TrueType fonts are rare. 
This is because software packages that support hinting functionality
are out of the budget of most small time designers.
Only a few major foundries, such as Monotype make well hinted 
fonts available.
<P>In conclusion, the main differences between TrueType and Type1 fonts 
are in availability and application support. The widespread availability
of TrueType fonts for Windows has resolted in webpages designed 
with the assumption that 
certain TrueType fonts are available. Also, many users have large 
numbers of TrueType fonts because they ship with the users Windows
applications. However, on Linux, most applications support Type1 fonts
but do not have the same level of support for TrueType. Moreover, most
major font foundries still ship most of their fonts in Type1 format.
For example, Adobe ship very few TrueType fonts.
My recommendation to users is to use whatever works for your 
application, and try to avoid converting from one format to another
where possible ( because the format conversion is not without loss ).
<H3>Metafont</H3>

<P>Metafont was developed by Donald E Knuth as part of the TeX typesetting
system. Metafont is a graphics programming language ( like postscript )
that has applications wider than just fonts.
Metafonts exhibit some very desirable qualities. One of the important
features is that metafonts can scale very gracefully.  The metafont
Computer Modern has different shape at 20 point and 10 point. The 
shape changes with size, because it is desirable for a smaller font
to be proportionately wider than a larger font ( this makes the larger
fonts more elegant and the smaller font more readable ).
<P>Metafonts typically have a <CODE>mf</CODE> extension. They are rendered
to device dependent bitmap fonts. The rendering is slow, so they
are of excellent quality, but are not well suited to WYSIWYG 
publishing.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Families of Typefaces</A>
</H2>

<P>Typically typically come in groups of a few variants. For example,
most fonts come with a bold, italic, and bold-italic variant.
Some fonts may also have small caps, and demibold variants.
A group of fonts consisting of a font and its variants is 
called a <EM>family</EM> of typefaces.
For example, the Garamond family consists of Garamond,
Garamond-italic, Garamond-bold, Garamond bold-italic,
Garamond demi-bold, and Garamond demi-bold-italic. The Adobe 
expert Garamond font also makes available Garamond small caps,
and Garamond titling capitals.
