<P> Please let me know of any errors in facts, opinions, logic,
spelling, grammar, clarity, links, etc.  But first, if the date is
over a month old, check to see that you have the latest version.
Please send me any info that you think belongs in this document.
<P>I haven't studied the code used by various Linux drivers to implement
Plug-and-Play.  Nor do I fully understand how PnP is configured by the
BIOS (it depends on which BIOS) nor how Windows9x updates the ESCD.
Thus this HOWTO is still incomplete and may be inaccurate (let me know
where I'm wrong).  In this HOWTO I've sometimes used ??  to indicate
that I don't really know the answer.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 New Versions of this HOWTO</A>
</H2>

<P> New versions of the Plug-and-Play-HOWTO should appear every
month or two and will be available to browse and/or download at LDP
mirror sites.  For a list of mirror sites see: 
<A HREF="http://linuxdoc.org/mirrors.html">http://linuxdoc.org/mirrors.html</A>.  Various formats are
available.  If you only want to quickly check the date of the latest
version look at: 
<A HREF="http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html">http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html</A>.
The version you are now reading is: v1.01, April 2001 .  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 New in Recent Versions</A>
</H2>

<P> v1.01 April 2001 less shortage today of
bus-resouces, clarity in sect. 2, Windows 2000 OK (even if "not a PnP
OS" in CMOS)
<P>The version 1.0 (Nov. 2000) was long overdue and recognized that the
kernel is doing more in helping device drivers set up PnP.  Kernel 2.4
is significantly improved in this respect.  There's still a lot of
improvements needed in both this HOWTO and the way that Linux does
PnP.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 General Introduction.  Do you need this HOWTO?</A>
</H2>

<P> Plug-and-play (PnP) is a system which automatically detects PC
devices such as disks, sound cards, ethernet cards, modems, etc.  It
also does some low-level configuring of them.  To be detected by PnP, the
device must be designed for PnP.  Non-PnP devices (or PnP devices which
have been correctly PnP-configured), can often be detected by
non-PnP methods.  
<P>While the Linux kernel has no centralized plug-and-play system, it
does provide programs which various device drivers can use to do their
own plug-and-play.  Many drivers take advantage of this and find your
PnP devices OK.  The BIOS hardware of your PC likely may also do some
plug-and-play work.  Thus if everything works OK PnP-wise, you can use
your computer without needing to know anything about plug-and-play.
But if some devices which are supported by Linux don't work (because
they not discovered or configured correctly by PnP) then you may need
to read some of this HOWTO.  You'll learn not only about PnP but also
something about how communication takes place inside the computer.
<P>In this document I mention so many things that can go wrong that one
who believes in Murphy's Law (If something can go wrong it will) may
become quite alarmed.  But for PnP for most people: If something can
go wrong it usually doesn't.  Remember that sometimes problems which
seem to be PnP related are actually due to defective hardware or to
hardware that doesn't conform to PnP specs.
