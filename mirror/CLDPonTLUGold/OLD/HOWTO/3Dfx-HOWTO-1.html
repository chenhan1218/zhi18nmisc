<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>This is the Linux 3Dfx HOWTO document. It is intended as a quick
reference covering everything you need to know to install and
configure 3Dfx support under Linux. Frequently asked questions
regarding the 3Dfx support are answered, and references
are given to some other sources of information on a variety of topics
related to computer generated, hardware accelerated 3D graphics.
<P>This information is only valid for Linux on the Intel platform.  Some
information may be applicable to other processor architectures, but I
have no first hand experience or information on this. It is only
applicable to boards based on 3Dfx technology, any other graphics
accelerator hardware is beyond the scope of this document.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Contributors and Contacts</A>
</H2>

<P>This document would not have been possible without all the
information contributed by other people - those involved
in the Linux Glide port and the beta testing process, in
the development of Mesa and the Mesa Voodoo drivers, or
rewieving the document on behalf of 3Dfx and Quantum3D.
Some of them contributed entire sections to this document.
<P>Daryll Strauss
<A HREF="mailto:Daryll Strauss &lt;daryll@harlot.rb.ca.us>">daryll@harlot.rb.ca.us</A> did the port,
Paul J. Metzger

modified the Mesa Voodoo driver (written by
David Bucciarelli
<A HREF="mailto:David Bucciarelli &lt;tech.hmw@plus.it>">tech.hmw@plus.it</A>) for Linux, 
Brian Paul 
<A HREF="mailto:Brian Paul &lt;brianp@RA.AVID.COM>">brianp@RA.AVID.COM</A>
integrated it
with his famous Mesa library. With respect to Voodoo Graphics (tm)
accelerated Mesa, additional thanks has to go to Henri Fousse,
Gary McTaggart, and the maintainer of the 3Dfx Mesa
for DOS,  Charlie Wallace
<A HREF="mailto:Charlie Wallace &lt;Charlie.Wallace@unistudios.com>">Charlie.Wallace@unistudios.com</A>.
The folks at 3Dfx,
notably Gary Sanders, Rod Hughes, and Marty Franz, provided
valuable input, as did Ross Q. Smith of Quantum3D. The
pages on the Voodoo Extreme and Operation 3Dfx websites
provided useful info as well, and in some case I relied on
the 3Dfx local Newsgroups. The Linux glQuake2 port
that uses Linux Glide and Mesa is maintained by
Dave Kirsch

Thanks to all those who sent
e-mail regarding corrections and updates, and special
thanks to Mark Atkinson for reminding me of the dual
cable setup.
