<P> For modems on the PCMCIA bus see the PCMCIA-HOWTO: PCMCIA serial
and modem devices.  This HOWTO also doesn't cover PPP (used to connect
to the Internet via a modem) or communication programs.  Except it
does show how to use communication programs to test that your modem
works OK and can make phone calls.  If you want to use a modem to
connect to the Internet then you need to set up PPP.  There's a lot of
documentation for PPP (including a PPP-HOWTO).  More documentation
should be found in /usr/doc/ppp, /usr/share/doc/ppp or the like.

<H2><A NAME="what_is_modem"></A> <A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 What is a Modem ? </A>
</H2>

<P> A modem is a device that lets one send digital signals over an
ordinary telephone line not designed for digital signals.  If
telephone lines were all digital then you wouldn't need a modem.  It
permits your computer to connect to and communicate with the rest of
the world.  When you use a modem, you normally use a communication
program or web browser to utilize the modem and dial-out on a
telephone line.  Advanced modem users can set things up so that others
may phone in to them and use their computer.  This is called
"dial-in".
<P>There are three basic types of modems for a PC: external, internal,
and built-in.  The external sets on your desk outside the PC while the
other two types are not visible since they're inside the PC.  The
external modem plugs into a connector on the back of the PC known as a
"serial port".  The internal modem is a card that is inserted inside
the computer. The built-in modem is part of the motherboard and is
thus built into the computer.  It's is just like an internal modem
except it can't be removed or replaced.  As of 2001, built-in modems
are primarily for laptops.  What is said in this HOWTO regarding
internal modems will generally apply also to built-in modems.
<P>For a more detailed comparison see 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-2.html#int_vs_ext">External vs.  Internal</A>.   When you get an internal (or built-in) modem, you
also get a dedicated serial port (which can only be used with the
modem and not with anything else such as another modem or a printer).
In Linux, the serial ports are named ttyS0, ttyS1, etc. (usually
corresponding respectively to COM1, COM2, etc. in Dos/Windows). 
<P>The serial port is not to be confused with the "Universal Serial Bus"
(USB) which uses a special modular connector and may be used to
connect an external modem.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-4.html#basics_">Modem &amp; Serial Port Basics</A> for more details on modems and serial ports.
<P>Modems usually include the ability to send Faxes (Fax Modems).  See
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-15.html#fax_">Fax</A> for a list of fax software.  "Voice" modems
can work like an automatic answering machine and handle voicemail.
See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-12.html#voice_">Voicemail</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.8">1.8 Quick Install</A>
</H2>

<H3>External Modem Install</H3>

<P> With a straight-thru or modem cable, connect the modem to an
unused serial port on the PC.  Make sure you know the name of the
serial port: in most cases COM1 is ttyS0, COM2 is ttyS1, etc.  You may
need to check the BIOS setup menu to determine this.  Plug in the
power cord to provide power to the modem.  See 
<A HREF="#all_modems">All Modems</A> for further instructions.
<P>
<H3>Internal Modems (Both ISA and PCI)</H3>

<P> The first thing to do is to make sure that the modem will work
under Linux since (as of late 2000) most newer modems don't.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html">modem list</A>.
If the modem is both PnP and directly supported by the serial driver
(kernel 2.4 +) then there is no configuring for you to do since the
driver will configure it. 
<P>To physically install a modem card, remove the cover of the PC by
removing some screws (perhaps screw size 6-32 in the U.S.).  Find a
matching vacant slot for it next to the other adapter cards.  Before
inserting the card in the slot, remove a small cover plate on the back
of the PC so that the telephone jacks on the card will be accessible
from the rear of the PC.  Then carefully align the card with the slot
and push the card all the way down into the slot.  Attach the card
with a mounting screw (usually 3mm, .5mm pitch --don't use the wrong
size).
<P>If you have a modem that is not a winmodem (see 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-2.html#soft_modem">Software-based Modems (winmodems)</A>) and you must configure it
yourself (the driver doesn't do it) then you first need to decide
which ttySx to assign it to.  Pick a ttySx that is not already in use
by other serial ports.  Then you have the problem of setting an IRQ
number and IO address.  For PnP modems: If the BIOS has already set
these in the physical device (which a PnP BIOS will do if it thinks you
don't have a PnP OS) then you need to determine the IRQ and IO address
and then tell this to "setserial".   In other cases you may have some
choice of IRQs and IO addresses (including the case where you are able
to change what the BIOS has set).  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-6.html#choose_IRQ">Choosing Serial IRQs</A> and 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-6.html#choose_address">Choosing Addresses</A>.  For ISA modems there are standard IO addresses to use
(corresponding to the ttySx).  PCI modems seem to use different IO
addresses so as not to conflict with ISA modems.  For example you may
find it feasible to use /dev/ttyS2 at IO address 0x3e8 and IRQ 11.
<P>
<H3>ISA Modems: What IOs and IRQs may be used?</H3>

<P> For old modems with jumpers look at the manual (or jumpers if they
say).  If the BIOS has already configured the ISA modem then "pnpdump
--dumpregs" should show it.  If you need to set or change them use
"isapnp".  Use the "pnpdump" to see what you changes are possible.
<P>
<H3>PCI Modems: What IOs and IRQs have been set?</H3>

<P> For PCI, the BIOS almost always sets the IRQ and may set the
IO address as well.  To see how it's set use "lspci -v" or look in
/proc/bus/pci.  If more than one IO address is shown, the first one is
more likely to be it.  You can't change the IRQ (at least not with
"setpci")   If you must, change the IO address with "setpci" by
changing the BASE_ADDRESS_0 or the like.  The _0 (or _1) after
BASE_ADDRESS must be the correct register.
<P>
<H3>Both PCI and ISA: Use setserial to tell the driver</H3>

<P> You must find the file where "setserial" is run at boot-time and
add a line something like: "setserial /dev/ttyS2 irq 5 port 0x0b8".
For setserial v2.15 and later the results of running "setserial" on
the command line may (or may not) be saved to /etc/serial.conf so that
it runs each time you boot.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#set_serial">What is Setserial</A> for more info.  See the next subsection 
<A HREF="#all_modems">All Modems</A> for further instructions on quick
installation.
<P>
<H3>Use MS Windows to set the BIOS (A last resort method)</H3>

<P> If you are using the BIOS to configure you may use MS Windows9x to
"force" the BIOS to set a certain IRQ and/or IO.  It can set them into
the PnP BIOS's flash memory where they will be used to configure for
Linux as well as Windows.  See "Plug-and-Play-HOWTO and search for
"forced" (occurs in several places).  For Windows3.x you can do the
same thing using the ICU under Windows 3.x.  A few modems have a way
to disable PnP in the modem hardware using software (under Windows)
that came with the modem.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="all_modems"></A> All Modems  </H3>

<P> Plug the modem into a telephone line.  Then configure a 
communication program such as minicom or a ppp program (such as
wvdial).  Set the serial port speed to a baud rate a few times higher
than the bit rate of your modem.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-14.html#speed_table">Speed Table</A> for the "best" speeds to use.  Tell it the full
name of your serial port such as /dev/ttyS1.  Set hardware flow
control (RTS/CTS).  
<P>Minicom is the easiest to set up and to use to test your modem.  But
if you are lucky you may get ppp to work the first time and not need
to bother with minicom.  With minicom you may simply type the command:
AT and hit enter (before dialing) to check that your modem is there
and responds with OK.
