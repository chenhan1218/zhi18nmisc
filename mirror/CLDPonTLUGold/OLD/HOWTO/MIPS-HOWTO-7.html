<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Milo</A></H2>

<P>Milo is the boot loader used to boot the little endian MIPS systems with
ARC firmware, currently the Jazz family and the SNI RM&nbsp;200.
While Milo uses the same name and has a similar purpose to the Alpha version
of Milo, these two Milos have nothing else in common.  They were developed
by different people, don't share any code, and work on different hardware
platforms.  The fact that both have the same name is just a kind of
historic ``accident''.
<P>Plans are to remove the need for Milo in the near future.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Building Milo</A>
</H2>

<P>The building procedure of Milo is described, in detail, in the README files
in the Milo package.  Since Milo has some dependencies to kernel header
files which have changed over time, Milo often cannot be built easily.
However, the Milo distribution includes binaries for both Milo and Pandora.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Pandora</A>
</H2>

<P>Pandora is a simple debugger which was primarily developed in order
to analyze undocumented systems.  Pandora includes a disassembler,
memory dump functions, and more.  If you only want to use Linux, then there is
no need to install Pandora, despite its small size.
