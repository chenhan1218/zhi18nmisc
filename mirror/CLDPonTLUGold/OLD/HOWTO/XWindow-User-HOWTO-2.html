<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 The X Window System: History and Architecture</A>
</H2>

<P>The <EM>X Window System</EM> was developed in the Laboratory for
Computer Science at the <EM>Massachusetts Institute of
Technology</EM>, as part of project Athena in cooperation with DEC,
and first released in 1984. The project lead of the main development
was Robert Scheifler, and the origins of X owe much debt to the
<EM>``W''</EM> Windowing package, developed by Paul Asente at
<EM>Stanford</EM>. In September of 1987, MIT issued the
first release of the X11 that we know and use today. As of X11R2,
control passed from MIT to the <EM>X Consortium</EM>, formed in January
of 1988.
<P>Many of the ideas that went into X Window also came from research at
Xerox Corporation's <EM>Palo Alto Research Center</EM> (PARC), where
they were working on computers like the Parc and the Star in the late
seventies. None of these computers made it to market, but when Xerox
demonstrated a window system custom built to run <EM>Smalltalk
80</EM>, people were hooked. These series of three computers
demonstrated the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) interface so
well that it spawned a revolution in computing almost
overnight. Within a few years many computer users got a taste of a
windowing system of some kind, and you might say they never looked
back.
<P>X Window is currently developed and distributed by the X Consortium,
however, a liberal license permits the existence of free and low-cost
implementations.  The version of X used on Linux is XFree86. XFree86
is a collection of X servers for UNIX-like OSs on Intel x86
platforms. The work is derived from X386, and much of it is
contributed back into X11R6 thereafter. We can think of XFree86, for
all intents and purposes, to be X Window for Linux, unless you have
purchased another X server.
<P>X Window is built upon a great many toolkits, or libraries. It is
built upon the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widgets. Many
programs use XView or Motif tools. More still are part of a newer,
unified windowing and communication system, like GNOME or KDE. If you
find many of your programs not compiling, or are getting strange and
inexplicable errors, you may wish to make sure that you have
installed X correctly, because most of these libraries (with the
exception of Motif) are free and most likely preinstalled with X on
your system.
<P>And remember, it's called X Window, <EM>not</EM> X Windows!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Anatomy of Your Desktop</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a few basic principles and terms you should familiarize
yourself with to make using X much more straightforward. These terms
will appear over and over again in the manual pages and help files,
which it is suggested that you consult whenever necessary.
<P>The <B>screen</B> is your whole ``desktop'', and the words may be used
interchangeably.  Technically it means the primary video display you
view X with, and you can have more than one screen, in fact you can
have more than one computer running off a single X server. This is
beyond the scope of this humble document, but you should be aware of
the distinction.
<P>The <B>root window</B> is the background of your screen. It is
referred to a window in name alone, it does not behave like any other
window, but rather you run your applications on the root window, or
put a picture on it, or just a solid color.
<P>The <B>window manager</B> is the main interface between the X Window
system and the user. Without the window manager, the system would be
rather difficult to use, and would certainly not be a very productive
tool. The window manager provides such functionality as window
borders, menus, icons, virtual desktops, button bars, tool bars, and
allows the user to customize it at will, often adding to its
functionality in the process.
<P>The <B>pointer</B> is the arrow or indicator of any given shape
which represents the location your mouse (or other pointing device)
corresponds to on the screen.  The pointer often changes to give you
contextual feedback as to what will happen when you use the mouse at
that point on the screen.
<P>The <B>window</B> is a frame in which any given application resides
which is ``managed'' by the window manager. This includes pretty much
anything except the so-called root window. Even windows which do not
appear to have frames, titles, or normal borders of any kind are being
managed by your window manger. The <B>active window</B> is the window
you are currently using, the window that will receive text when you
type,
and is traditionally denoted by the fact that your mouse cursor is
pointing at it, though this is not always the case. The active window
is
said to have ``focus,'' the rest of the windows on your display being
``unfocused.''
<P><B>Menus</B> and <B>icons</B> behave in X similar to the way they
behave in other windowing systems, and the same general principles
apply. Windows with text only are called <B>terminal emulators</B>,
an example would be xterm, and these basically emulate a console
text-only display, but let you multiplex and use more than one at a
time, and have many other advantages available due to their being
used in X. We shall discuss many of these later on.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Invoking X Window</A>
</H2>

<P>Starting X can be done in several ways. On your system it may be
set up to start automatically, and you will not need to read this
section. Most Linux systems, however, presently start at the command
line upon login, and you have to decipher this for yourself.
<P>The most basic way to start X is with <B>xinit</B>. This will put
you at a blank desktop, by default, and with no window manager
loaded. If no client program is specified on the command line,
<B>xinit</B> will look for the <EM>.xinitrc</EM> file to run as a
shell script, to start up client programs. If this file does not
exist, <B>xinit</B> will use the following command as a default:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 xterm -geometry +1+1 -n login -display :0
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As you see, this is not very helpful. The most common way to start X
is with the command <B>startx</B>. This is the most civilized
fashion to start the windowing system, but requires that you log in
from a text shell, and start the windowing system yourself. For many
Linux users this is the most common way to start X, it is also the
most flexible. You can issue commands such as the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 startx -- -bpp 8    #start x in 256 color mode
 startx -- -bpp 32   #start x in true color mode
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The double dashes pass arguments directly to xinit, and this way you
can start up X in the resolution your work will require, and still
have it use the configuration files we will cover later in this
document.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 The X Display Manager</A>
</H2>

<P>The program <B>xdm</B> provides similar services to  <B>getty</B>
and <B>login</B>, which allow users to log into a  system and start
their basic shell. If you start X with <B>xdm</B>,  however, users
need only to type in their username and password at a  friendly prompt,
and they are dropped directly into the graphical  environment. This is
simple and easy to use, and is seen frequently  in college campuses,
cyber cafes, business environments, anywhere you  have users not
necessarily familiar with Unix to any great extent.
<P><B>xdm</B> can be configured with configuration  files located in
<EM>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm</EM> on your Linux  system. The file
<CODE>xdm-config</CODE> is for configuring how the  login screen appears to
users, and <CODE>Xsetup_0</CODE> is used to tell   xdm what programs should
be launched when X is started. Some of the  configuration a normal user
would put in their <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> file  should go in here, if xdm is
to be normally used.
<P>Here is a sample <CODE>Xsetup_0</CODE> file to look at, which might help to 
configure your system. The <CODE>xfstt</CODE> program is the TrueType font 
server, and is discussed later in  this document. Also, notice that 
we're using a shell script here, and it's trying to call <B>xv</B> to 
set the background to a nice picture (instead of the boring black and 
white background pattern), and if that call fails, <B>xsetroot</B> is 
called, to at least try to set the background to a nice blue color.

<P>Many distributions of Linux include this facility automatically.  If you
are able to look at the run levels for your Linux system, you can
probably
see that run level 3 is the normal startup (look under
<CODE>/etc/rc.d</CODE>)
unless you're booting into something like <EM>xdm</EM>.  If you are,
you're
going to be starting in run level 5.  This is something of a standard on
Linux (and similar) systems.  Programs such as <EM>linuxconf</EM> and
its
functional equivalents should be able to adjust this.
<P>Also on many newer Linux systems are facilities such as <EM>gdm</EM> and
<EM>kdm</EM>, which are GNOME and KDE aware equivalents of this program.
Primarily, this just changes the look and feel to suit your desktop
preferance, but often these other versions contain more features, such
as
remembering which desktop environment you last logged in to, the ability
to shutdown and reboot from the console, and so forth.
