<H2><A NAME="s13">13. Configuring the <EM>node</EM> software.</A></H2>

<P>The <EM>node</EM> software was developed by Tomi Manninen
<CODE>&lt;tomi.manninen@hut.fi></CODE> and was based on the original PMS program.
It provides a fairly complete and flexible node capability that is easily
configured. It allows users once they are connected to make Telnet, NetRom,
Rose, and AX.25 connections out and to obtain various sorts of information such
as Finger, Nodes and Heard lists etc. You can configure the node to execute
any Linux command you wish fairly simply.
<P>The node would normally be invoked from the <EM>ax25d</EM> program although
it is also capable of being invoked from the TCP/IP <EM>inetd</EM> program to
allow users to telnet to your machine and obtain access to it, or by running
it from the command line.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1 Creating the <CODE>/etc/ax25/node.conf</CODE> file.</A>
</H2>

<P>The <CODE>node.conf</CODE> file is where the main configuration of the node
takes place. It is a simple text file and its format is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /etc/ax25/node.conf
# configuration file for the node(8) program.
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments and are ignored.

# Hostname
# Specifies the hostname of the node machine
hostname        radio.gw.vk2ktj.ampr.org

# Local Network
# allows you to specify what is consider 'local' for the
# purposes of permission checking using nodes.perms.
localnet        44.136.8.96/29

# Hide Ports
# If specified allows you to make ports invisible to users. The
# listed ports will not be listed by the (P)orts command.

# Node Identification.
# this will appear in the node prompt
NodeId          LINUX:VK2KTJ-9

# NetRom port
# This is the name of the netrom port that will be used for
# outgoing NetRom connections from the node.
NrPort          netrom

# Node Idle Timeout
# Specifies the idle time for connections to this node in seconds.
idletimout      1800

# Connection Idle Timeout
# Specifies the idle timer for connections made via this node in
# seconds.
conntimeout     1800

# Reconnect
# Specifies whether users should be reconnected to the node
# when their remote connections disconnect, or whether they
# should be disconnected complete.

# Provide a way of making complex node commands simple.

<H2><A NAME="ss13.2">13.2 Creating the <CODE>/etc/ax25/node.perms</CODE> file.</A>
</H2>

<P>The <EM>node</EM> allows you to assign permissions to users. These permissions
allow you to determine which users should be allowed to make use of options
such as the (T)elnet, and (C)onnect commands, for example, and which
shouldn't. The <CODE>node.perms</CODE> file is where this information is stored
and contains five key fields. For all fields an asterisk `*'
character matches anything. This is useful for building default rules.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>user</B><DD><P>The first field is the callsign or user to which the permissions should apply.
Any SSID value is ignored, so you should just place the base callsign here.
<DT><B>method</B><DD><P>Each protocol or access method is also given permissions. For example you
might allow users who have connected via AX.25 or NetRom to use the (C)onnect
option, but prevent others, such as those who are telnet connected from a
non-local node from having access to it. The second field therefore allows
you to select which access method this permissions rule should apply to.
The access methods allowed are:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
method  description
------  -----------------------------------------------------------
ampr    User is telnet connected from an amprnet address (44.0.0.0)
ax25    User connected by AX.25
host    User started node from command line
inet    user is telnet connected from a non-loca, non-ampr address.
local   User is telnet connected from a 'local' host
netrom  User connected by NetRom
rose    User connected by Rose
*       User connected by any means.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DT><B>port</B><DD><P>For AX.25 users you can control permissions on a port by port basis too if you
choose. This allows you to determine what AX.25 are allowed to do based on
which of your ports they have connected to. The third field contains the port
name if you are using this facility. This is useful only for AX.25 connections.
<DT><B>password</B><DD><P>You may optionally configure the node so that it prompts users to enter a
password when they connect. This might be useful to help protect specially
configured users who have high authority levels. If the fourth field is 
set then its value will be the password that will be accepted.
<DT><B>permissions</B><DD><P>The permissions field is the final field in each entry in the file.
The permissions field is coded as a bit field, with each facility having a bit
value which if set allows the option to be used and if not set prevents the
facility being used. The list of controllable facilities and their
corresponding bit values are:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
value   description
-----   -------------------------------------------------
 1      Login allowed.
 2      AX25 (C)onnects allowed.
 4      NetRom (C)onnects allowed.
 8      (T)elnet to local hosts allowed.
 16     (T)elnet to amprnet (44.0.0.0) hosts allowed.
 32     (T)elnet to non-local, non-amprnet hosts allowed.
 64     Hidden ports allowed for AX.25 (C)onnects.
 128    Rose (C)onnects allowed.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

To code the permissions value for a rule, simply take each of the permissions
you want that user to have and add their values together. The resulting number
is what you place in field five.

<P>A sample <CODE>nodes.perms</CODE> might look like:

<H2><A NAME="ss13.3">13.3 Configuring <EM>node</EM> to run from <EM>ax25d</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>The <EM>node</EM> program would normally be run by the <EM>ax25d</EM> program.
To do this you need to add appropriate rules to the
<CODE>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</CODE> file. In my configuration I wanted users
to have a choice of either connecting to the <EM>node</EM> or connecting to
other services. <EM>ax25d</EM> allows you to do this by cleverly creating
creating port aliases. For example, given the <EM>ax25d</EM> configuration
presented above, I want to configure <EM>node</EM> so that all users who connect
to <CODE>VK2KTJ-1</CODE> are given the node. To do this I add the following to
my <CODE>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</CODE> file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[vk2ktj-1 via radio]
default    *     *    *   *   *   0    root /usr/sbin/node node
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This says that the Linux kernel code will answer any connection requests for
the callsign `<CODE>VK2KTJ-1</CODE>' heard on the AX.25 port named `<CODE>radio</CODE>', and
will cause the <EM>node</EM> program to be run.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.4">13.4 Configuring <EM>node</EM> to run from <EM>inetd</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>If you want users to be able to telnet a port on your machine and obtain
access to the <EM>node</EM> you can go this fairly easily. The first thing
to decide is what port users should connect to. In this example I've
arbitrarily chosen port 4000, though Tomi gives details on how you could
replace the normal telnet daemon with the <EM>node</EM> in his documentation.
<P>You need to modify two files.
<P>To <CODE>/etc/services</CODE> you should add:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
node    3694/tcp        #OH2BNS's node software
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and to <CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE> you should add:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
node    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/node node
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

When this is done, and you have restarted the <EM>inetd</EM> program any user
who telnet connects to port 3694 of your machine will be prompted to login
and if configured, their password and then they will be connected to the
<EM>node</EM>.
