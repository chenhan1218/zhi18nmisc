<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Installing the AX.25/NetRom/Rose software.</A></H2>

<P>To successfully install AX.25 support on your linux system you must configure
and install an appropriate kernel and then install the AX.25 utilities.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Compiling the kernel.</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are already familiar with the process of compiling the Linux Kernel
then you can skip this section, just be sure to select the appropriate options
when compiling the kernel. If you are not, then read on.
<P>The normal place for the kernel source to be unpacked to is the
<CODE>/usr/src</CODE> directory into a subdirectory called <CODE>linux</CODE>.
To do this you should be logged in as <CODE>root</CODE> and execute a series
of commands similar to the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mv linux linux.old
# cd /usr/src
# tar xvfz linux-2.0.31.tar.gz
# tar xvfz /pub/net/ax25/ax25-module-14e.tar.gz 
# patch -p0 &lt;/usr/src/ax25-module-14/ax25-2.0.31-2.1.47-2.diff
# cd linux
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After you have unpacked the kernel source and applied the upgrade, you need
to run the configuration script and choose the options that suit your hardware
configuration and the options that you wish built into your kernel.
You do this by using the command:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# make menuconfig
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You might also try:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# make config
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I'm going to describe the full screen method (menuconfig) because it is easier
to move around, but you use whichever you are most comfortable with.
<P>In either case you will be offered a range of options at which you must
answer `Y' or `N'. (Note you may also answer `M' if you are using modules.
For the sake of simplicity I will assume you are not, please make appropriate
modifications if you are).
<P>The options most relevant to an AX.25 configuration are:
<P>
<PRE>
Code maturity level options  --->
    ...
    [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
    ...
General setup  --->
    ...
    [*] Networking support
    ...
Networking options  --->
    ...
    [*] TCP/IP networking
    [?] IP: forwarding/gatewaying
    ...
    [?] IP: tunneling
    ...
    [?] IP: Allow large windows (not recommended if &lt;16Mb of memory)
    ...
    [*] Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2
    [?] Amateur Radio NET/ROM
    [?] Amateur Radio X.25 PLP (Rose)
    ...
Network device support  --->
    [*] Network device support
    ...
    [*] Radio network interfaces
    [?] BAYCOM ser12 and par96 driver for AX.25
    [?] Soundcard modem driver for AX.25
    [?] Soundmodem support for Soundblaster and compatible cards
    [?] Soundmodem support for WSS and Crystal cards
    [?] Soundmodem support for 1200 baud AFSK modulation
    [?] Soundmodem support for 4800 baud HAPN-1 modulation
    [?] Soundmodem support for 9600 baud FSK G3RUH modulation
    [?] Serial port KISS driver for AX.25
    [?] BPQ Ethernet driver for AX.25
    [?] Gracilis PackeTwin support for AX.25
    [?] Ottawa PI and PI/2 support for AX.25
    [?] Z8530 SCC KISS emulation driver for AX.25
    ...
</PRE>
<P>The options I have flagged with a `<CODE>*</CODE>' are those that you <B>must</B> must
answer `Y' to. The rest are dependent on what hardware you have and what
other options you want to include. Some of these options are described in more
detail later on, so if you don't know what you want yet, then read ahead
and come back to this step later.
<P>After you have completed the kernel configuration you should be able to
cleanly compile your new kernel:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# make dep
# make clean
# make zImage
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>maake sure you move your <CODE>arch/i386/boot/zImage</CODE> file wherever you
want it and then edit your <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> file and rerun <EM>lilo</EM>
to ensure that you actually boot from it.
<P>
<H3>A word about Kernel modules</H3>

<P>I recommend that you <B>don't</B> compile any of the drivers as modules. In
nearly all installations you gain nothing but additional complexity. Many
people have problems trying to get the modularised components working, not
because the software is faulty but because modules are more complicated to
install and configure.
<P>If you've chosen to compile any of the components as modules, then you'll
also need to use:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# make modules
# make modules_install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to install your modules in the appropriate location.
<P>You will also need to add some entries into your <CODE>/etc/conf.modules</CODE>
file that will ensure that the <EM>kerneld</EM> program knows how to handle the
kernel modules. You should add/modify the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
alias net-pf-3     ax25
alias net-pf-6     netrom
alias net-pf-11    rose
alias tty-ldisc-1  slip
alias tty-ldisc-3  ppp
alias tty-ldisc-5  mkiss
alias bc0          baycom
alias nr0          netrom
alias pi0a         pi2
alias pt0a         pt
alias scc0         optoscc    (or one of the other scc drivers)
alias sm0          soundmodem
alias tunl0        newtunnel
alias char-major-4 serial
alias char-major-5 serial
alias char-major-6 lp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>What's new in 2.0.*+ModuleXX or 2.1.* Kernels ?</H3>

<P>The <CODE>2.1.*</CODE> kernels have enhanced versions of nearly all of the protocols
and drivers. The most significant of the enhancements are:
<DL>
<DT><B>modularised</B><DD><P>the protocols and drivers have all been modularised so
that you can <EM>insmod</EM> and <EM>rmmod</EM> them whenever you wish. This reduces
the kernel memory requirements for infrequently used modules and makes
development and bug hunting much simpler. That being said, it also makes
configuration slightly more difficult.
<DT><B>All drivers are now network drivers</B><DD><P>all of the network devices such
as Baycom, SCC, PI, Packettwin etc now present a normal network interface, that
is they now look like the ethernet driver does, they no longer look like KISS
TNC's. A new utility called <EM>net2kiss</EM> allows you to build a kiss interface
to these devices if you wish.
<DT><B>bug fixed</B><DD><P>there have been many bug fixes and new features added to
the drivers and protocols. The Rose protocol is one important addition.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 The network configuration tools.</A>
</H2>

<P>Now that you have compiled the kernel you should compile the new network
configuration tools. These tools allow you to modify the configuration of
network devices and to add routes to the routing table.
<P>The new alpha release of the standard <CODE>net-tools</CODE> package includes
support for AX.25 and NetRom support. I've tested this and it seems to
work well for me.
<P>
<H3>A patch kit that adds Rose support and fixes some bugs.</H3>

<P>The standard net-tools-1.33.tar.gz package has some small bugs that affect
the AX.25 and NetRom support. I've made a small patch kit that corrects these
and adds Rose support to the tools as well.
<P>You can get the patch from:
<A HREF="ftp://zone.pspt.fi/pub/linux/ham/ax25/net-tools-1.33.rose.tjd.diff.gz">zone.pspt.fi</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Building the standard net-tools release.</H3>

<P>Don't forget to read the <CODE>Release</CODE> file and follow any instructions
there. The steps I used to compile the tools were:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cd /usr/src
# tar xvfz net-tools-1.33.tar.gz
# zcat net-tools-1.33.rose.tjd.diff.gz | patch -p0
# cd net-tools-1.33
# make config
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At this stage you will be presented with a series of configuration questions,
similar to the kernel configuration questions. Be sure to include support for
all of the protocols and network devices types that you intend to use. If you
do not know how to answer a particular question then answer `Y'.
<P>When the compilation is complete, you should use the:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>command to install the programs in their proper place.
<P>
<P>If you wish to use the IP firewall facilities then you will need the latest
firewall administration tool <CODE>ipfwadm</CODE>. This tool replaces the older
<CODE>ipfw</CODE> tool which will not work with new kernels.
<P>I compiled the <CODE>ipfwadm</CODE> utility with the following commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cd /usr/src
# tar xvfz ipfwadm-2.0beta2.tar.gz
# cd ipfwadm-2.0beta2
# make install
# cp ipfwadm.8 /usr/man/man8
# cp ipfw.4 /usr/man/man4
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 The AX.25 user and utility programs.</A>
</H2>

<P>After you have successfully compiled and booted your new kernel, you need to
compile the user programs. To compile and install the user programs you should
use a series of commands similar to the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cd /usr/src
# tax xvfz ax25-utils-2.1.42a.tar.gz
# cd ax25-utils-2.1.42a
# make config
# make
# make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The files will be installed under the <CODE>/usr</CODE> directory by default
in subdirectories: <CODE>bin</CODE>, <CODE>sbin</CODE>, <CODE>etc</CODE> and <CODE>man</CODE>.
<P>If this is a first time installation, that is you've never installed any
ax25 utilities on your machine before you should also use the:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# make installconf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>command to install some sample configuration files into the <CODE>/etc/ax25/</CODE>
directory from which to work.
<P>
<P>If you get messages something like:
<PRE>
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -I../lib -c call.c
call.c: In function `statline':
call.c:268: warning: implicit declaration of function `attron'
call.c:268: `A_REVERSE' undeclared (first use this function)
call.c:268: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
call.c:268: for each function it appears in.)
</PRE>
<P>then you should double check that you have the <EM>ncurses</EM> package
properly installed on your system. The configuration script attempts
to locate your ncurses packages in the common locations, but
some installations have ncurses badly installed and it is unable
to locate them.
