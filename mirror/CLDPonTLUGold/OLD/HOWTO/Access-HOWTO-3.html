<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Visually Impaired</A></H2>

<P>I'll use two general categories here.  People who are partially
sighted and need help seeing / deciphering / following the text and
those who are unable to use any visual interface whatsoever.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Seeing the Screen with Low Vision</A>
</H2>

<P>There are many different problems here.  Often magnification can be
helpful, but that's not the full story.  Sometimes people can't track
motion, sometimes people can't find the cursor unless it moves.  This
calls for a range of techniques, the majority of which are only just
being added to X.
<P>
<H3>SVGATextMode</H3>

<P>This program is useful for improving the visibility of the normal
text screen that Linux provides.  The normal screen that Linux
provides shows 80 characters across by 25 vertically.  This can be
changed (and the quality of those characters improved) using
SVGATextMode.  The program allows full access to the possible modes of
an SVGA graphics card.  For example, the text can be made larger so
that only 50 by 15 characters appear on the screen.  There isn't any
easy way to zoom in on sections of a screen, but you can resize when
needed.
<P>
<H3>X Window System </H3>

<P>For people who can see the screen there are a large number of ways
of improving X.  They don't add up to a coherent set of features yet,
but if set up correctly could solve many problems.
<P>
<H3>Different Screen Resolutions</H3>

<P>The X server can be set up with many different resolutions.  A
single key press can then change between them allowing difficult
to read text to be seen.
<P>In the file <CODE>/etc/XF86Config</CODE>, you have an entry in the Screen section
with a line beginning with modes.  If, for example, you set this to
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Modes       "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "320x240"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

with each mode set up correctly (which requires a reasonably good
monitor for the highest resolution mode), you will be able to have
four times screen magnification, switching between the different
levels using
<P><CODE>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus</CODE> and <CODE>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus</CODE>
<P>
<P>Moving the mouse around the screen will scroll you to different parts
of the screen.  For more details on how to set this up you should see
the documentation which comes with the <B>XFree86</B> X server.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="screen-mag"></A> Screen Magnification</H3>

<P>There are several known screen magnification programs, <CODE>xmag</CODE> which
will magnify a portion of the screen as much as needed but is very
primitive.  Another one is <CODE>xzoom</CODE>.  Previously I said that there
had to be something better than <CODE>xmag</CODE>, well this is it.  See
section 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-8.html#xzoom">xzoom</A>.
<P>Another program which is available is <CODE>puff</CODE>.  This is
specifically oriented towards visually impaired users.  It provides
such features as a box around the pointer which makes it easier to
locate.  Other interesting features of <CODE>puff</CODE> are that, if
correctly set up, it is able to select and magnify portions of the
screen as they are updated.  However, there seem to be interacations
between <CODE>xpuff</CODE> and the window manager which could make it
difficult to use.  When used with my <CODE>fvwm</CODE> setup, it didn't
respond at all to key presses.  However using <CODE>twm</CODE> improved the
situation.  
<P>The final program which I have seen working is <CODE>dynamag</CODE>.  This
again has some specific advantages such as the ability to select a
specific area of the screen and monitor it, refreshing the magnified
display at regular intervals between a few tenths of a second at
twenty seconds.  <CODE>dynamag</CODE> is part of the UnWindows distribution.  See
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-8.html#unwindows">UnWindows</A> for more details.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Change Screen Font</H3>

<P>The screen fonts all properly written X software should be
changeable.  You can simply make it big enough for you to read.  This
is generally accomplished by putting a line the file <CODE>.Xdefaults</CODE>
which should be in your home directory.  By putting the correct lines
in this you can change the fonts of your programs, for example
<P>
<PRE>
Emacs.font: -sony-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-150-75-75-c-80-iso8859-*
</PRE>
<P>To see what fonts are available, use the program <CODE>xfontsel</CODE> under
X.
<P>There should be some way of changing things at a more fundamental
level so that everything comes out with a magnified font.  This could
be done by renaming fonts, and by telling telling font generating
programs to use a different level of scaling.  If someone gets this
to work properly, please send me the details of how you did it.
<P>
<H3>Cross Hair Cursors etc..</H3>

<P>For people that have problems following cursors there are many things
which can help;
<P>
<UL>
<LI>cross-hair cursors (horizontal and vertical lines from the
edge of the screen)
</LI>
<LI>flashing cursors (flashes when you press a key)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>No software I know of specifically provides a cross hair cursor.
<CODE>puff</CODE>, mentioned in the previous section does however provide a
flashing box around the cursor which can make it considerably easier
to locate.  
<P>
<P>For now the best that can be done is to change the cursor bitmap.
Make a bitmap file as you want it, and another one which is the same
size, but completely black.  Convert them to the XBM format and run
<P>
<PRE>
        xsetroot -cursor cursorfile.xbm black-file.xbm
</PRE>
<P>actually, if you understand masks, then the black-file doesn't have to
be completely black, but start with it like that.  The <CODE>.Xdefaults</CODE>
file controls cursors used by actual applications.  For much more
information, please see the X Big Cursor mini-HOWTO, by Joerg
Schneider 
<A HREF="mailto:schneid@ira.uka.de">&lt;schneid@ira.uka.de&gt;</A>.
<P>
<H3>Audio </H3>

<P>Provided that the user can hear, audio input can be very useful for
making a more friendly and communicative computing environment.  For a
person with low vision, audio clues can be used to help locate the
pointer (see 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-8.html#unwindows">UnWindows</A>).  For a console
mode user using Emacspeak (see 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-8.html#emacspeak">Emacspeak</A>),
the audio icons available will provide very many useful facilities.
<P>Setting up Linux audio is covered in the Linux Sound HOWTO (see 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-7.html#linux-docs">Linux Documentation</A>).  Once sound is set up,
sounds can be played with the <CODE>play</CODE> command which is included with
most versions of Linux.  This is the way to use my version of
UnWindows.
<P>
<H3>Producing Large Print</H3>

<P>Using large print with Linux is quite easy.  There are several
techniques.  
<P>
<H3>LaTeX / TeX</H3>

<P>LaTeX is an extremely powerful document preparation system.  It may
be used to produce large print documents of almost any nature.  Though
somewhat complicated to learn, many documents are produced using LaTeX
or the underlying typesetting program, TeX.
<P>
<P>
<P>this will produce some reasonably large text
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
\font\magnifiedtenrm=cmr10 at 20pt  % setup a big font
\magnifiedtenrm
this is some large text
\bye
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>For more details, see the LaTeX book which is available in any
computer book shop.  There are also a large number of introductions
available on the internet. 
<P>
<H3>Outputting Large Text</H3>

<P>Almost all Linux printing uses postscript, and Linux can drive almost
any printer using it.  I output large text teaching materials using a
standard Epson dot matrix printer.
<P>For users of X, there are various tools available which can produce
large Text.  These include <CODE>LyX</CODE>, and many commercial word
processors.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Aids for Those Who Can't Use Visual Output</A>
</H2>

<P>For someone who is completely unable to use a normal screen there
are two alternatives Braille and Speech.  Obviously for people who
also have hearing loss, speech isn't always useful, so Braille will
always be important.
<P>If you can choose, which should you choose?  This is a matter of
`vigorous' debate.  Speech is rapid to use, reasonably cheap and
especially good for textual applications (e.g. reading a long document
like this one).  Problems include needing a quiet environment,
possibly needing headphones to work without disturbing others and
avoid being listened in on by them (not available for all speech
synthesisers).
<P>Braille is better for applications where precise layout is important
(e.g. spreadsheets).  Also can be somewhat more convenient if you want
to check the beginning of a sentence when you get to the end.  Braille
is, however, much more expensive and slower for reading text.
Obviously, the more you use Braille, the faster you get.  Grade II
Braille is difficult to learn, but is almost certainly worth it since
it is much faster.  This means that if you don't use Braille for a
fair while you can never discover its full potential and decide for
yourself. Anyway, enough said on this somewhat controversial topic.

<A HREF="mailto:jrbowden@bcs.org.uk">&lt;jrbowden@bcs.org.uk&gt;</A><P>
<H3>Braille Terminals</H3>

<P>Braille terminals are normally a line or two of Braille.  Since these
are at most 80 characters wide and normally 40 wide, they are somewhat
limited.  I know of two kinds
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hardware driven Braille terminals.</LI>
<LI>Software driven Braille terminals.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The first kind works only when the computer is in text mode and
reads the screen memory directly. See section 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-9.html#memmap-braille">hardware driven Braille terminals</A>.
<P>
<P>The second kind of Braille terminal is similar, in many ways,
to a normal terminal screen of the kind Linux supports automatically.
Unfortunately, they need special software to make them usable.
<P>
<P>There are two packages which help with these.  The first,
<CODE>BRLTTY</CODE>, works with several Braille display types and the authors
are keen to support more as information becomes available.  Currently
<CODE>BRLTTY</CODE> supports Tieman B.V.'s CombiBraille series, Alva B.V.'s
ABT3 series and Telesensory Systems Inc.'s PowerBraille and Navigator
series displays.  The use of Blazie Engineering's Braille Lite as a
Braille display is discouraged, but support may be renewed on demand.
See section 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-9.html#serial-braille">Software Braille Terminals</A>.
<P>
<P>The other package I am aware of is Braille Enhanced Screen.  This
is designed to work on other UNIX systems as well as Linux.  This
should allow user access to a Braille terminal with many useful
features such as the ability to run different programs in different
`virtual terminals' at the same time.
<P>
<H3>Speech Synthesis</H3>

<P>Speech Synthesisers take (normally) ASCII text and convert it into
actual spoken output.  It is possible to have these implemented as
either hardware or software.  Unfortunately, the free Linux speech
synthesisers are, reportedly, not good enough to use as a sole means
of output.  
<P>
<P>Hardware speech synthesisers are the alternative.  The main one
that I know of that works is DECtalk from Digital, driven by
<CODE>emacspeak</CODE>.  However, at this time (March 1997) a driver for the
Doubletalk synthesiser has been announced.  Using <CODE>emacspeak</CODE> full
access to all of the facilities of Linux is fairly easy.  This
includes the normal use of the shell, a world wide web browser and
many other similar features, such as email.  Although, it only acts as
a plain text reader (similar to IBM's one for the PC) when controling
programs it doesn't understand, with those that it does, it can
provide much more sophisticated control.  See section 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-8.html#emacspeak">Emacspeak</A> for more information about
<CODE>emacspeak</CODE>.
<P>
<H3>Handling Console Output</H3>

<P>When it starts up, Linux at present puts all of its messages straight
to the normal (visual) screen.  This could be changed if anyone with a
basic level of kernel programming ability wants to do it.  This means
that it is impossible for most Braille devices to get information
about what Linux is doing before the operating system is completely
working.  
<P>
<P>It is only at that stage that you can start the program that you need
for access.  If the <CODE>BRLTTY</CODE> program is used and run very early in the
boot process, then from this stage on the messages on the screen can
be read.  Most hardware and software will still have to wait until the
system is completely ready.  This makes administering a Linux system
difficult, but not impossible for a visually impaired person.  Once
the system is ready however, you can scroll back by pressing (on the
default keyboard layout) Shift-PageUP.
<P>
<P>There is one Braille system that can use the console directly,
called the Braillex.  This is designed to read directly from the
screen memory.  Unfortunately the normal scrolling of the terminal
gets in the way of this.  If you are using a Kernel newer than 1.3.75,
just type <CODE>linux no-scroll</CODE> at the LILO prompt or configure LILO to
do this automatically. If you have an earlier version of Linux, see
section 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-9.html#memmap-braille">Screen Memory Braille Terminals</A> 
<P>
<P>The other known useful thing to do is to use sounds to say when each
stage of the boot process has been reached. (T.V. Raman suggestion)
<P>
<H3>Optical Character Recognition</H3>

<P>There is a free Optical Character Recognition (OCR) program for
Linux called <CODE>xocr</CODE>.  In principle, if it is good enough, this
program would allow visually impaired people to read normal books to
some extent (accuracy of OCR is never high enough..).  However,
according to the documentation, this program needs training to
recognise the particular font that it is going to use and I have no
idea how good it is since I don't have the hardware to test it.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Beginning to Learn Linux</A>
</H2>

<P>Beginning to learn Linux can seem difficult and daunting for someone
who is either coming from no computing background or from a pure DOS
background.  Doing the following things may help:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Learn to use Linux (or UNIX) on someone else's system before
setting up your own.</LI>
<LI>Initially control Linux from your own known speaking/Braille
terminal.  If you plan to use speech, you may want to learn <CODE>emacs</CODE>
now.  You can learn it as you go along though.  See below</LI>
<LI>If you come from an MS-DOS background, read the DOS2Linux Mini
HOWTO for help with converting (see 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-7.html#HOWTOs">The Linux HOWTO Documents</A>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The Emacspeak HOWTO written by Jim Van Zandt (
<A HREF="mailto:jrv@vanzandt.mv.com">&lt;jrv@vanzandt.mv.com&gt;</A>)
covers this in much more detail (see 
<A HREF="Access-HOWTO-7.html#HOWTOs">The Linux HOWTO Documents</A>).
<P>
<P>If you are planning to use Emacspeak, you should know that Emacspeak
does not attempt to teach Emacs, so in this sense, prior knowledge of
Emacs would always be useful.  This said, you certainly do not need to know
much about Emacs to start using Emacspeak.  In fact, once Emacspeak is
installed and running, it provides a fluent interface to the rich set
of online documentation including the info pages, and makes learning
what you need a lot easier.
<P>"In summary: starting to use Emacspeak takes little learning.  Getting
the full mileage out of Emacs and Emacspeak, especially if you intend
using it as a replacement for X Windows as I do does involve
eventually becoming familiar with a lot of the Emacs extensions; but
this is an incremental process and does not need to be done in a day."

which include one covering UNIX.  These can be got from

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Braille Embossing</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux should be the perfect platform to drive a Braille embosser
from.  There are many formatting tools which are aimed specifically at
the fixed width device.  A Braille embosser can just be connected to
the serial port using the standard Linux printing mechanisms.  For
more info see the Linux Printing HOWTO.
<P>
<P>There is a free software package which acts as a multi-lingual
grade two translator available for Linux from the American ``National
Federation for the Blind''.  This is called NFBtrans.  See section
