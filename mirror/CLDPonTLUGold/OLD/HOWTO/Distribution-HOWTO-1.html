<P>There is no single distribution of the Linux software. Instead,
there are many such distributions, available both via anonymous FTP
and by mail order on CD-ROM.
<P>The purpose of this document is to provide short summaries of the
English-language Linux CD-ROM distributions, and to provide
pointers for the reader to find more information.  A German
Distributions HOWTO was formerly maintained by Marco Budde but
seems to have disappeared.  We are not aware of any distributions
in languages other than English and German.
<P>The information presented here is not complete; there are other
Linux distributions than are listed here.  By the nature of open
source software, anyone that changes anything in their Linux
installation and makes it available to others somehow is `a
distribution'. A document such as this has to pick somewhere to
draw the line.  I have picked `available on CD'. This is by no
means the definition of a Linux distribution.  There are numerous
small distributions that offer things the big distros don't, not
the least of which is smallness itself.
<P>The information presented here is not complete; there are other
Linux distributions than are listed here. If you are associated
with a CD-ROM distribution we don't list, please see
<A HREF="Distribution-HOWTO-3.html#submissions">Submissions To This Document</A>
near the end of this document
for information on making a submission.  It's easy and should take
less then five minutes.
<P>For a more complete list of distributions (albeit with sparser
information on each) see the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxhq.com/dist-index.html">Linux HQ Distributions List</A>.
<P><B>Disclaimer:</B> We make absolutely <EM>no</EM> guarantee as to the
correctness of the information, prices, and ordering details given
in this document. Check the last-modified field of each to get an
idea of its currency, then go to the vendor's web page for
up-to-date information.  Furthermore, unless otherwise stated the
Linux software comes with <EM>ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY</EM>.
<P>Your editor tries to stick to facts in most of this HOWTO, but he
has some opinions on the state of the Linux market.  If you care
what they are, you can read them under 
<A HREF="#opinions">Editorial Recommendations</A>.
<P><B>Disclosure:</B> I (esr) have no financial connection to any Linux
vendor, nor have I accepted any renumeration or perquisites from
any vendor other than free product for review (and one T-shirt from
Red Hat).

send me general Linux questions or requests for help in
choosing a distribution unless you're willing to hire me at
normal consulting rates; I don't have time to deal with them,
and I try to put everything I know about choosing a
distribution in this document.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Recent Changes</A>
</H2>

<P>Yggdrasil Plug-And-Play and Craftworks Linux seem no longer to be
available for sale, and have been dropped.  DOSLINUX has also been
dropped due to its specialist nature.  KRUD, Linux-Mandrake, and
LinuxGT have been added.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Overview of the Linux Market</A>
</H2>

<P>In the beginning (say, 1993), a Linux distribution was something
you downloaded off the Internet onto floppies.  Installation was a
laborious process and repeated frustrations due to bad media were
common.
<P>Then came cheap CD-ROM drives and the CD-ROM, a medium ideally
suited for shipping large volumes of operating-system software
cheaply.  There's a whole mini-industry now built around commercial
CD-ROM Linuxes, and (because the vendors have actual cash flow to
fund support and marketing) they increasingly dominate the Linux
world.  Debian is now the only significant non-commercial release,
and even it seems to be propagated largely by shovelware CD-ROMs.
<P>Most of the CD-ROM distributions (including Slackware, Yggdrasil and
Red Hat) are still available for FTP from the home sites of their
developers.  But if you have a CD-ROM drive and a few dollars, you
will have many more distributions and more support options to
choose from (and you'll usually get some useful paper
documentation).  For more on the details of installation, see
the Linux Installation HOWTO,
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO.html">http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO.html</A>.
<P>Prices for CD-ROM distributions of Intel Linuxes start at
$20 and top out at a whole $50 (and the extra few
dollars can buy real value).  Many vendors sell subscription deals
that will lower your cost-per-CD for regular updates over the
subscription period.
<P>Price correlates with features and quality pretty well (as one
would expect in a very competitive market).  Your editor recommends
paying the few extra dollars for a top-drawer original CD-ROM
distribution; this will pay off in fewer installation and
administration hassles down the road.
<P>Making good choices is much simpler than it used to be.  In 1995-96
the Linux market underwent a serious shakeout, with a very few
commercial distributions emerging as leaders while weaker ones
disappeared or stagnated.  The toll among general-purpose
non-commercial distributions has been even fiercer; essentially,
only Debian survives in this role.
<P>As a result, the three-tier structure of primary distribution
builders, value-added repackagers, and bottom-feeding CD shovellers
that used to define the market has nearly collapsed.  To be
competitive in the third millennium, a Linux outfit (whether
commercial or noncommercial) has to offer reasonable support and
behave like a primary distribution builder, whether it's really one
or not. So as long as you look for a recent freeze date, it is
pretty hard to get stuck with a dud distribution these days.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="opinions"></A> <A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Editorial Recommendations</A>
</H2>

<P>Last section, the facts.  In this section, my opinions (for
whatever they're worth -- and remember the caveat about free
advice).  There is no substitute for doing your own evaluation
based on experience and the data in this guide, and these are
intended more to illuminate my possible biases than as a guide to
what you should do.
<P>From the beginnings of the Linux CD-ROM industry in 1993 to Fall
1995, Yggdrasil was the king of the hill -- it essentially founded
the CD-ROM market and then set the standard for everybody else.  I
used Yggdrasil, and I recommended it over commercial System V
versions for its superior documentation, large collection of
applications, and enlightened policy of sending free releases to
open-source authors and dedicating part of the price of each CD-ROM to
financially supporting free software.  But Yggdrasil hasn't issued
a new release since 1995 and they've been left behind by the
market.
<P>I now run Red Hat Linux and am quite satisfied with it. They have
successfully created a de-facto standard in distribution packaging
with RPM (now also used by SuSE and Mandrake, among others). They've
made most of the right moves at the right times and I consider them
the current market leader.
<P>If you're ideologically wedded to using a non-commercial distribution,
Debian seems to me to be the clear choice, the only one left with
a serious support team behind it. 
<P>These opinions should certainly not be interpreted as an
unconditional endorsement; different Linux distributions are
optimized for different needs, and yours may well be best served by
some other distribution (especially if, unlike me, you're mainly a
DOS user and are looking for a distribution tuned for dual-boot
systems and being launched from DOS).
<P>Furthermore, industry standing is volatile.  By the time you read
this, Red Hat or Debian may well have fallen off their games and
been displaced by hungrier newcomers.
