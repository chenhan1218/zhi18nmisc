<H2><A NAME="s16">16. Thanks.</A></H2>

<P>Among the many people who showed me how great Unix and the Unix
machine can be, some people have earned a special place
I would like to thank them:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>My &quot;Vieux matou&quot; Michel F. Who gave me my first acount
on a real Unix machine, and took the time to answer my questions,
showing me among other things how to take advantage of the hardware's
feature.</LI>
<LI>Nathalie S. Who was always able to guess at the speed of light
what went wrong and fixed it on the fly. And took time to install the
tools I needed.</LI>
<LI>Yves D. Who among other things always welcomed my questions, and
whose office was always open even late in the evening.</LI>
</UL>
 
Both of them beeing real Sysadmin and teatchers
from the trenches, have a very
deep knowledge and understandement of the Hardware and Software.
<P>
