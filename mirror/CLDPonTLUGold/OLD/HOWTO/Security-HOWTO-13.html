<P>
<OL>
<LI> Is it more secure to compile driver support directly into the
kernel, instead of making it a module?
<P>Answer: Some people think it is better to disable the ability to load
device drivers using modules, because an intruder could load a Trojan
module or a module that could affect system security.
<P>However, in order to load modules, you must be root.  The module
object files are also only writable by root.  This means the intruder
would need root access to insert a module.  If the intruder gains root
access, there are more serious things to worry about than whether he
will load a module.
<P>Modules are for dynamically loading support for a particular device
that may be infrequently used.  On server machines, or firewalls for
instance, this is very unlikely to happen.  For this reason, it would
make more sense to compile support directly into the kernel for
machines acting as a server.  Modules are also slower than support
compiled directly in the kernel.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> Why does logging in as root from a remote machine always fail?
<P>Answer: See 
<A HREF="Security-HOWTO-4.html#root-security">Root Security</A>.  This is done
intentionally to prevent remote users from attempting to connect via
<CODE>telnet</CODE> to your machine as <CODE>root</CODE>, which is a serious
security
vulnerability, because then the root password would be transmitted, in
cleartext, across the network.  Don't forget: potential intruders have time on their
side, and can run automated programs to find your password.

<LI> How do I enable shadow passwords on my Red Hat 4.2 or 5.x Linux
box?
<P>Answer:
<P>To enable shadow passwords, run <CODE>pwconv</CODE> as root, and
<CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> should now exist, and be used by applications.
If you are using RH 4.2 or above, the PAM modules will automatically
adapt to the change from using normal <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> to shadow
passwords without any other change.
<P>Some background: shadow passwords is a mechanism for storing your
password in a file other than the normal <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file.  This has
several advantages.  The first one is that the shadow file,
<CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE>, is only readable by root, unlike <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE>,
which must remain readable by everyone.  The other advantage is that as the
administrator, you can enable or disable accounts without everyone
knowing the status of other users' accounts.
<P>The <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file is then used to store user and group names, used
by programs like <CODE>/bin/ls</CODE> to map the user ID to the proper username
in a directory listing.
<P>The <CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> file then only contains the username and his/her
password, and perhaps accounting information, like when the account
expires, etc.
<P>To enable shadow passwords, run <CODE>pwconv</CODE> as root, and
<CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> should now exist, and be used by applications.
Since you are using RH 4.2 or above, the PAM modules will automatically
adapt to the change from using normal <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> to shadow
passwords without any other change.
<P>Since you're interested in securing your passwords, perhaps you would
also be interested in generating good passwords to begin with.  For
this you can use the <CODE>pam_cracklib</CODE> module, which is part of PAM.  It
runs your password against the Crack libraries to help you decide if
it is too-easily guessable by password-cracking programs.

<LI> How can I enable the Apache SSL extensions?
<P>Answer:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Get SSLeay 0.8.0 or later from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL">ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL</A><P>
</LI>
<LI>Build and test and install it!<P>
</LI>
<LI>Get Apache 1.2.5 source<P>
</LI>
<LI>Get Apache SSLeay extensions from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/SSL/apache_1.2.5+ssl_1.13.tar.gz">here</A><P>
</LI>
<LI>Unpack it in the apache-1.2.5 source directory and patch Apache as
per the README.<P>
</LI>
<LI>Configure and build it.<P>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>You might also try 
<A HREF="http://www.zedz.net">ZEDZ net</A>
which has many pre-built packages, and is located outside of the United States.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> How can I manipulate user accounts, and still retain security?
<P>Answer:  The Red Hat distribution, especially RH5.0, contains a great
number of tools to change the properties of user accounts.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>pwconv</CODE> and <CODE>unpwconv</CODE> programs can be used to convert 
between shadow and non-shadowed passwords.</LI>
<LI>The <CODE>pwck</CODE> and <CODE>grpck</CODE> programs can be used to verify proper
organization of the <CODE>passwd</CODE> and <CODE>group</CODE> files.</LI>
<LI>The <CODE>useradd</CODE>, <CODE>usermod</CODE>, and <CODE>userdel</CODE> programs can be used to
add, delete and modify user accounts.  The <CODE>groupadd</CODE>,
<CODE>groupmod</CODE>, and <CODE>groupdel</CODE> programs will do the same for groups.</LI>
<LI>Group passwords can be created using <CODE>gpasswd</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>All these programs are "shadow-aware" -- that is, if you enable shadow
they will use <CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> for password information, otherwise they won't.
<P>See the respective man pages for further information.

<LI> How can I password-protect specific HTML documents using
Apache?
<P>I bet you didn't know about
