<P>Associated with the language specification is a collection of commentaries
which discuss design decisions, provide examples, and consider how the
language may be implemented. These commentaries were originally proposals to
the TSQL2 Language Design Committee. They now serve a different purpose: to
provide examples of the constructs, motivate the many decisions made during
the language design, and compare TSQL2 with the many other language
proposals that have been made over the last fifteen years. It should be
emphasized that these commentaries are not part of the TSQL2 language
specification per se, but rather supplement and elaborate upon it. The
language specification proper is the final word on TSQL2.
<P>The commentaries, along with the language specification, several

<H2><A NAME="SQL 1998"></A> <A NAME="ss29.9">29.9 Part 0 - Acquiring ISO/ANSI SQL Documents </A>
</H2>

<P>This document shows you how to (legally) acquire a copy
of the SQL-92 standard and how to acquire a copy of the "current" SQL3
Working Draft.
<P>The standard is copyrighted ANSI standard by ANSI, the ISO standard by ISO.
<P>There are two (2) current SQL standards, an ANSI publication
and an ISO publication. The two standards are word-for-word identical
except for such trivial matters as the title of the document, page
headers, the phrase "International Standard" vs "American Standard", and
so forth.
<P>Buying the SQL-92 Standard
<P>The ISO standard, ISO/IEC 9075:1992, Information Technology - Database
Languages - SQL, is currently (March, 1993) available and in stock from
ANSI at:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

     Phone (sales): +1.212.642.4900
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

at a cost of US$230.00. The ANSI version, ANSI X3.135-1992, American
National Standard for Information Systems - Database Language SQL, was
not available from stock at this writing, but was expected to be
available by some time between late March and early May, 1993). It is
expected to be be priced at US$225.00.
<P>If you purchase either document from ANSI, it will have a handling
charge of 7% added to it (that is, about US$9.10). Overseas shipping
charges will undoubtedly add still more cost. ANSI requires a hardcopy
of a company purchase order to accompany all orders; alternately, you
can send a check drawn on an US bank in US dollars, which they will cash
and clear before shipping your order. (An exception exists: If your
organization is a corporate member of ANSI, then ANSI will ship the
documents and simply bill your company.)
<P>The ISO standard is also available outside the United States from local
national bodies (country standardization bodies) that are members of
either ISO (International Organization for Standardization) or IEC
(International Electrotechnical Commission). Copies of the list of
national bodies and their addresses are available from ANSI or from
other national bodies. They are also available from ISO:

for a cost of US$308.00. I do not know if that includes shipping or not,
but I would guess that international shipping (at least) would cost
extra. They will be able to ship you a document fairly quickly and will
even accept "major credit cards". Global does not yet have the ANSI
version nor do they have a price or an expected date (though I would
expect it within a few weeks following the publication by ANSI and at a
price near US$300.00).
<P>Buying a copy of the SQL3 Working Draft
<P>You can purchase a hardcopy of the SQL3 working draft from the ANSI X3
Secretariat, CBEMA (Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers
Association). They intend to keep the "most recent" versions of the SQL3
working draft available and sell them for about US$60.00 to US$65.00.

host must have Internet access to do this. The login is 'ftp' and the
password is your email address (this is sometimes referred to as
'anonymous ftp'). The command 'type binary' is used to ensure that no
bits are stripped from the file(s) received. 'get' gets one file at a
time. Comments in the script below are inside angle brackets &lt; like so &gt; .

Retrieving Files Without Direct ftp Support
<P>Digital Equipment Corporation, like several other companies, provides
ftp email service. The response can take several days, but it does
provide a service equivalent to ftp for those without direct Internet
ftp access. The address of the server is:
<P>ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
<P>The following script will retrieve the PostScript for the latest version
of the SQL3 document:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     reply joe.programmer@imaginary-corp.com
     connect gatekeeper.dec.com anonymous
     binary
     compress
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The following script will retrieve the PostScript for the latest version
of the SQL3 document:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     reply joe.programmer@imaginary-corp.com
     connect gatekeeper.dec.com anonymous
     binary

     uuencode
     chdir /pub/standards/sql
     get x3h2-93-091.ps
     quit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The first line in the script commands the server to return the requested
files to you; you should replace "joe.programmer@imaginary-corp.com"
with your Internet address. The file in this example, x3h2-93-091.ps,
is returned in "compress"ed "uuencode"d format as 34 separate email
messages. If your environment does not provide tools for reconstructing
such files, then you could retrieve the file as plain text with the
following script:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     reply joe.programmer@imaginary-corp.com
     connect gatekeeper.dec.com anonymous
     chdir /pub/standards/sql
     get x3h2-93-091.ps
     quit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

But be warned, the .ps file will probably be sent to you in more than 70
parts!
<P>To retrieve any particular file, other than x3h2-93-091.ps, simply
replace "x3h2-93-091.ps" with the name of the desired file. To get a
directory listing of all files available, replace "get x3h2-93-091.ps"
with "dir".
<H2><A NAME="ss29.10">29.10 Part 1 - ISO/ANSI SQL Current Status</A>
</H2>

<P>This chapter is a source of information about the SQL
standards process and its current state.
<P>Current Status:
<P>Development is currently underway to enhance SQL into a computationally
complete language for the definition and management of persistent, complex
objects. This includes: generalization and specialization hierarchies,
multiple inheritance, user defined data types, triggers and assertions,
support for knowledge based systems, recursive query expressions, and
additional data administration tools. It also includes the specification of
abstract data types (ADTs), object identifiers, methods, inheritance,
polymorphism, encapsulation, and all of the other facilities normally
associated with object data management.
<P>In the fall of 1996, several parts of SQL3 went through an ISO CD ballot.
Those parts were SQL/Framework, SQL/Foundation, and SQL/Bindings. Those
ballots failed (as expected) with 900 or so comments. In Late January, there
was an ISO DBL editing meeting that processed a large number of problem
solutions that were either included with ballot comments or submitted as
separate papers. Since the DBL editing meeting was unable to process all of
the comments, the editing meeting has been extended. The completion of the
editing meeting is scheduled for the end of July, 1997, in London.
<P>Following the July editing meeting, the expectation is that a Final CD
ballot will be requested for these parts of SQL. The Final CD process will
take about 6 months and a DBL editing meeting, after which there will be a
DIS ballot and a fairly quick IS ballot.
<P>The ISO procedures have changed since SQL/92, so the SQL committees are
still working through the exact details of the process.
<P>If everything goes well, these parts of SQL3 will become an official ISO/IEC
standard in late 1998, but the schedule is very tight.
<P>In 1993, the ANSI and ISO development committees decided to split future SQL
development into a multi-part standard. The Parts are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>   Part 1: Framework A non-technical description of how the document is
structured.</LI>
<LI>   Part 2: Foundation The core specification, including all of the new ADT
features.</LI>
<LI>   Part 3: SQL/CLI The Call Level Interface.</LI>
<LI>   Part 4: SQL/PSM The stored procedures specification, including
computational completeness.</LI>
<LI>   Part 5: SQL/Bindings The Dynamic SQL and Embedded SQL bindings taken
from SQL-92.</LI>
<LI>   Part 6: SQL/XA An SQL specialization of the popular XA Interface
developed by X/Open</LI>
<LI>   Part 7:SQL/TemporalAdds time related capabilities to the SQL standards.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the USA, the entirety of SQL3 is being processed as both an ANSI Domestic
("D") project and as an ISO project. The expected time frame for completion
of SQL3 is currently 1999.
<P>The SQL/CLI and SQL/PSM are being processed as fast as possible as addendums
to SQL-92. In the USA, these are being processed only as International ("I")

<P>NIST Validation
<P>SQL implementations are validated (in the Unites States) by the National
Institute of Standards and Training (NIST). NIST currently has a validation
test suite for entry level SQL-92. The exact details of the NIST validation
requirements are defined as a Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS). The current requirements for SQL are defined in FIPS 127-2. The
Postscript and Text versions of this document can be retrieved from NIST.
The current SQL Validated Products List can also be retrieved from NIST.
<P>Standard SQL Publications and Articles

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Several people have questioned the need for additional support for time in
SQL3 (as proposed by DBL RIO-75, requesting a new part of SQL to support
temporal databases). The claim is that abstract data types (ADT's) are
sufficient for temporal support. In this informational item, I argue, using
concrete examples, that using columns typed with abstract data types is
inadequate for temporal queries. In particular, many common temporal queries
are either difficult to simulate in SQL, or require embedding SQL in a
procedural language. Alternatives are expressed in TSQL2, a temporal
extension to SQL-92.
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

<P>Valid-time support goes beyond that of a temporal ADT. With the later, a
column is specified as of a temporal domain, such as DATE or INTERVAL
(examples will be given shortly). With valid time, the rows of a table vary
over time, as reality changes. The timestamp associated with a row of a
valid-time table is interpreted by the query language as the time when the
combination of values of the columns in the row was valid. This implicit
timestamp allows queries to be expressed succinctly and intuitively.
<H3>A CASE STUDY - STORING CURRENT INFORMATION</H3>

<P>The University of Arizona's Office of Appointed Personnel has some
information in a database, including each employee's name, their current
salary, and their current title. This can be represented by a simple table.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        Employee(Name, Salary, Title)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Given this table, finding an employee's salary is easy.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SELECT Salary
        FROM Employee
        WHERE Name = 'Bob'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Now the OAP wishes to record the date of birth. To do so, a column is added
to the table, yielding the following schema.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        Employee(Name, Salary, Title, DateofBirth DATE)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Finding the employee's date of birth is analogous to determining the salary.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SELECT DateofBirth
        FROM Employee
        WHERE Name = 'Bob'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>A CASE STUDY - STORING HISTORY INFORMATION</H3>

<P>The OAP wishes to computerize the employment history. To do so, they append
two columns, one indicating when the information in the row became valid,
the other indicating when the information was no longer valid.
<P>Employee (Name, Salary, Title, DateofBirth, Start DATE, Stop DATE)
<P>To the data model, these new columns are identical to DateofBirth. However,
their presence has wide-ranging consequences.
<H3>A CASE STUDY - PROJECTION</H3>

<P>To find an employee's current salary, things are more difficult.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SELECT Salary
        FROM Employee
        WHERE Name = 'Bob' AND Start &lt;= CURRENT_DATE AND CURRENT_DATE &lt;= Stop
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This query is more complicated than the previous one. The culprit is
obviously the two new columns. The OAP wants to distribute to each employee
their salary history. Specifically, for each person, the maximal intervals
at each salary needs to be determined. Unfortunately, this is not possible
in SQL. An employee could have arbitrarily many title changes between salary
changes.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Name    Salary  Title             DateofBirth   Start           Stop

Note that there are three rows in which Bob's salary remained constant at
$70,000. Hence, the result should be two rows for Bob.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Name    Salary  Start           Stop

One alternative is to give the user a printout of Salary and Title
information, and have user determine when his/her salary changed. This
alternative is not very appealing or realistic. A second alternative is to
use SQL as much as possible.

                         WHERE T1.Salary = T2.Salary AND T1.Start &lt; T2.Start

                                AND T1.Stop >= T2.Start AND T1.Stop &lt; T2.Stop)

                        OR (T1.Start >= T2.Start AND T1.Stop &lt; T2.Stop))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The loop finds those intervals that overlap or are adjacent and thus should
be merged. The loop is executed log N times in the worst case, where N is
the number of rows in a chain of overlapping or adjacent value-equivalent
rows. The reader can simulate the query on the example table to convince
him/herself of its correctness.
<P>A third alternative is to use SQL only to open a cursor on the table. A
linked list of periods is maintained, each with a salary. This linked list
should be initialized to empty.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
DECLARE emp_cursor CURSOR FOR
        SELECT Salary, Title, Start, Stop
        FROM Employee;

        if no-data returned then goto finished;
        find position in linked list to insert this information;
        goto loop;
finished:
CLOSE emp_cursor;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

iterate through linked list, printing out dates and salaries
<P>The linked list may not be necessary in this case if the cursor is ORDER BY
Start.
<P>In any case, the query, a natural one, is quite difficult to express using
the facilities present in SQL-92. The query is trivial in TSQL2.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

        SELECT Salary
        FROM Employee

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>A CASE STUDY - JOIN</H3>

<P>A more drastic approach is to avoid the problem of extracting the salary
history by reorganizing the schema to separate salary, title, and date of
birth information (in the following, we ignore the date of birth, for
simplicity).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        Employee1 (Name, Salary, Start DATE, Stop DATE)
        Employee2 (Name, Title, Start DATE, Stop DATE)

The Employee1 table is as follows.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here is the example Employee2 table.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

With this change, getting the salary information for an employee is now
easy.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SELECT Salary, Start, Stop
        FROM Employee1
        WHERE Name = 'Bob'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

But what if the OAP wants a table of salary, title intervals (that is,
suppose the OAP wishes a table to be computed in the form of Figure 1)? One
alternative is to print out two tables, and let the user figure out the
combinations. A second alternative is to use SQL entirely. Unfortunately,
this query must do a case analysis of how each row of Employee1 overlaps
each row of Employee2; there are four possible cases.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept, Employee1.Start, Employee1.Stop
FROM Employee1, Employee2
WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name
     AND Employee2.Start &lt;= Employee1.Start AND Employee1.Stop &lt; Employee2.Stop
UNION
SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept, Employee1.Start, Employee2.Stop
FROM Employee1, Employee2
WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name
     AND Employee1.Start >= Employee2.Start AND Employee2.Stop &lt; Employee1.Stop
        AND Employee1.Start &lt; Employee2.Stop
UNION
SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept, Employee2.Start, Employee1.Stop
FROM Employee1, Employee2
WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name
     AND Employee2.Start > Employee1.Start AND Employee1.Stop &lt; Employee2.Stop
        AND Employee2.Start &lt; Employee1.Stop
UNION
SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept, Employee2.Start, Employee2.Stop
FROM Employee1, Employee2
WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name
     AND Employee2.Start > Employee1.Start AND Employee2.Stop &lt; Employee1.Stop
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Getting all the cases right is a challenging task. In TSQL2, performing a
temporal join is just what one would expect.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SELECT Employee1.Name, Salary, Dept
        FROM Employee1, Employee2
        WHERE Employee1.Name = Employee2.Name
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>A CASE STUDY - AGGREGATES</H3>

<P>Now the OAP is asked, what is the maximum salary? Before adding time, this
was easy.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SELECT MAX(Salary)
        FROM Employee
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Now that the salary history is stored, we'd like a history of the maximum
salary over time. The problem, of course, is that SQL does not provide
temporal aggregates. The easy way to do this is to print out the
information, and scan manually for the maximums. An alternative is to be
tricky and convert the snapshot aggregate query into a non-aggregate query,
then convert that into a temporal query. The non-aggregate query finds those
salaries for which a greater salary does not exist.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SELECT Salary
        FROM Employee AS E1
        WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                          FROM Employee AS E2
                          WHERE E2.Salary > E1.Salary)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Converting this query into a temporal query is far from obvious. The
following is one approach.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
CREATE TABLE Temp (Salary, Start, Stop)

        FROM Employee;
INSERT INTO Temp
        SELECT T.Salary, T.Start, E.Start
        FROM Temp AS T, Employee AS E
        WHERE E.Start >= T.Start AND E.Start &lt; T.Stop AND E.Salary > T.Salary;

INSERT INTO Temp
        SELECT T.Salary, T.Stop, E.Stop
        FROM Temp AS T, Employee AS E
        WHERE E.Stop > T.Start AND E.Stop &lt;= T.Stop AND E.Salary > T.Salary;

This approach creates an auxiliary table. We add to this table the lower
period of a period subtraction and the upper period of a period subtraction.
We then delete all periods that overlap with some row defined by the
subquery, thereby effecting the NOT EXISTS. Finally we generate from the
auxiliary table maximal periods, in the same way that the salary information
was computed above. As one might imagine, such SQL code is extremely
inefficient to execute, given the complex nested queries with inequality
predicates.
<P>A third alternative is to use SQL as little as possible, and instead compute
the desired maximum history in a host language using cursors.
<P>The query in TSQL2 is again straightforward and intuitive.

<H3>SUMMARY</H3>

<P>Time-varying data is manipulated in most database applications. Valid-time
support is absent in SQL. Many common temporal queries are either difficult
to simulate in SQL, or require embedding SQL in a procedural language, due
to SQL's lack of support for valid-time tables in its data model and query
constructs.
<P>Elsewhere, we showed that adding valid-time support requires few changes to
the DBMS implementation, can dramatically simplify some queries and enable
others, and can later enable optimizations in storage structures, indexing
methods, and optimization strategies that can yield significant performance
improvements.
<P>With a new part of SQL3 supporting time-varying information, we can begin to
address such applications, enabling SQL3 to better manage temporal data.

-- Accredited Standards Committee
X3, Information Technology is announcing the approval of a new 
project on SQL/Temporal Support, ISO/IEC 9075 Part 7, with the work 
being done in Technical Committee X3H2, Database.  
The scope of this proposed standard specifies a new Part of the emerging 
SQL3 standard, e.g., Part 7, Temporal SQL, to be extensions to the SQL 
language supporting storage, retrieval, and manipulation of temporal data 
in an SQL database environment.  
The next X3H2 meeting is scheduled for March 11-14, 1996 in 
Kansas.
<P>Inquiries regarding this project should be sent to the

<H2><A NAME="ss29.17">29.17 Part 8 - ISO/ANSI SQL MULTIMEDIA (SQL/MM)</A>
</H2>

<P>A new ISO/IEC international standardization project for development of an
SQL class library for multimedia applications was approved in early 1993.
This new standardization activity, named SQL Multimedia (SQL/MM), will
specify packages of SQL abstract data type (ADT) definitions using the
facilities for ADT specification and invocation provided in the emerging
SQL3 specification. SQL/MM intends to standardize class libraries for
science and engineering, full-text and document processing, and methods for
the management of multimedia objects such as image, sound, animation, music,
and video. It will likely provide an SQL language binding for multimedia
objects defined by other JTC1 standardization bodies (e.g. SC18 for
documents, SC24 for images, and SC29 for photographs and motion pictures).
<P>The Project Plan for SQL/MM indicates that it will be a multi-part standard
consisting of an evolving number of parts. Part 1 will be a Framework that
specifies how the other parts are to be constructed. Each of the other parts
will be devoted to a specific SQL application package. The following SQL/MM
Part structure exists as of August 1994:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>   Part 1: Framework A non-technical description of how the document is
structured.</LI>
<LI>   Part 2: Full Text Methods and ADTs for text data processing. About 45
pages.</LI>
<LI>   Part 3: Spatial Methods and ADTs for spatial data management. About 200
pages with active contributions from Spatial Data experts from 3
national bodies.</LI>
<LI>   Part 4: General Purpose Methods and ADTs for complex numbers,
Facilities include trig and exponential functions, vectors, sets, etc.
Currently about 90 pages.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There are a number of standards efforts in the area of Spatial and
Geographic information:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>   ANSI X3L1 - Geographic Information Systems.
Mark Ashworth of Unisys is the liason between X3L1 and ANSI X3H2. He is
also the editor for parts 1, 3, and 4 of the SQL/MM draft.</LI>
