<H2><A NAME="s10">10. Other Hardware Devices</A></H2>

<P>Any other devices that didn't fit into any of the above categories
got lumped together here.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 Ethernet Devices (`ether=')</A>
</H2>

<P>Different drivers make use of different parameters, but they all
at least share having an IRQ, an I/O port base value, and
a name. In its most generic form, it looks something like this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        ether=irq,iobase[,param_1[,param_2,...param_8]]],name
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The first non-numeric argument is taken as the name.
The <CODE>param_n</CODE> values (if applicable) usually have
different meanings for each different card/driver.
Typical <CODE>param_n</CODE> values are used to specify things
like shared memory address, interface selection, DMA
channel and the like.
<P>The most common use of this parameter is to force probing
for a second ethercard, as the default is to only probe
for one. This can be accomplished with a simple:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        ether=0,0,eth1
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Note that the values of zero for the IRQ and I/O base in the
above example tell the driver(s) to autoprobe.
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE TO MODULE USERS: The above will <EM>not</EM> force a
probe for a second card if you are using the driver(s) as run time
loadable modules (instead of having them complied into the kernel).
Most Linux distributions use a bare bones kernel combined with a
large selection of modular drivers.  The <CODE>ether=</CODE> only applies 
to drivers compiled directly into the kernel.
<P>The Ethernet-HowTo has complete and extensive
documentation on using multiple cards and on the card/driver
specific implementation of the <CODE>param_n</CODE> values where used. 
Interested readers should refer to the section in that document 
on their particular card for more complete information.

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 The Floppy Disk Driver (`floppy=')</A>
</H2>

<P>There are many floppy driver options, and they are all listed in
<CODE>README.fd</CODE> in <CODE>linux/drivers/block</CODE>.  There are too
many options in that file to list here. Instead, only those
options that may be required to get a Linux install to proceed
on less than normal hardware are reprinted here.
<P><CODE>floppy=0,daring</CODE>
Tells the floppy driver that your floppy controller should be used
with caution (disables all daring operations). 
<P><CODE>floppy=thinkpad</CODE>
Tells the floppy driver that you have a Thinkpad. Thinkpads use an
inverted convention for the disk change line.
<P><CODE>floppy=nodma</CODE>
Tells the floppy driver not to use DMA for data transfers.
This is needed on HP Omnibooks, which don't have a workable
DMA channel for the floppy driver. This option is also useful
if you frequently get "Unable to allocate DMA memory" messages.
Use of `nodma' is not recommended if
you have a FDC without a FIFO (8272A or 82072). 82072A and
later are OK). The FDC model is reported at boot.
You also need at least a 486 to use nodma.
<P><CODE>floppy=nofifo</CODE>
Disables the FIFO entirely. This is needed if you get `Bus
master arbitration error' messages from your Ethernet card (or
from other devices) while accessing the floppy.
<P><CODE>floppy=broken_dcl</CODE>
Don't use the disk change line, but assume that the disk was
changed whenever the device node is reopened. Needed on some
boxes where the disk change line is broken or unsupported.
This should be regarded as a stopgap measure, indeed it makes
floppy operation less efficient due to unneeded cache
flushings, and slightly more unreliable. Please verify your
cable connection and jumper settings if you have any DCL
problems. However, some older drives, and also some Laptops
are known not to have a DCL.
<P><CODE>floppy=debug</CODE>
Print (additional) debugging messages.
<P><CODE>floppy=messages</CODE>
Print informational messages for some operations (disk change
notifications, warnings about over and underruns, and about
autodetection).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3 The Sound Driver (`sound=')</A>
</H2>

<P>The sound driver can also accept boot args to override the
compiled in values. This is not recommended, as it is
rather complex and the documentation for it in the kernel
mysteriously vanished (a hint).  You are better off to use 
sound as a module, or compile in your own values. 
<P>If you choose to use it regardless, then processing 
of the argument takes place in the file <CODE>dev_table.c</CODE>
in <CODE>linux/drivers/sound</CODE>. It accepts a boot arg
of the form:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        sound=device1[,device2[,device3...[,device11]]]
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>where each <CODE>deviceN</CODE> value is of the following format
<CODE>0xDTaaaId</CODE> and the bytes are used as follows:
<P>D - second DMA channel (zero if not applicable)
<P>T - device type: 1=FM, 2=SB, 3=PAS, 4=GUS, 5=MPU401, 
6=SB16, 7=SB16-MIDI,...  The listing of soundcard
types up to 26 (don't forget to convert back to hex
for command line use) are listed in the file
<CODE>linux/include/linux/soundcard.h</CODE> and 27 to 
999 (newer models) can be found in the file
<CODE>linux/drivers/sound/dev_table.h</CODE>.
<P>aaa - I/O address in hex.
<P>I - interrupt line in hex (i.e 10=a, 11=b, ...)
<P>d - First DMA channel.
<P>As you can see it gets pretty messy, and you <EM>really</EM>
are better off to use a modular driver or 
compile in your own personal values as recommended. Using a boot
arg of `sound=0' will disable the sound driver entirely.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.4">10.4 The Bus Mouse Driver (`bmouse=')</A>
</H2>

<P>The busmouse driver only accepts one parameter, that being
the hardware IRQ value to be used.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.5">10.5 The MS Bus Mouse Driver (`msmouse=')</A>
</H2>

<P>The MS mouse driver only accepts one parameter, that being
the hardware IRQ value to be used.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.6">10.6 The Printer Driver (`lp=')</A>
</H2>

<P>With this boot argument you can tell the printer driver
what ports to use and what ports <EM>not</EM> to use. The latter comes
in handy if you don't want the printer driver to claim all available
parallel ports, so that other drivers (e.g. PLIP, PPA) can use
them instead.
<P>The format of the argument is multiple i/o, IRQ pairs. For example,
<CODE>lp=0x3bc,0,0x378,7</CODE> would use the port at <CODE>0x3bc</CODE> in IRQ-less
(polling) mode, and use IRQ 7 for the port at <CODE>0x378</CODE>. The port
at <CODE>0x278</CODE> (if any) would not be probed, since autoprobing only
takes place in the absence of a <CODE>lp=</CODE> argument. To disable the
printer driver entirely, one can use <CODE>lp=0</CODE>.
