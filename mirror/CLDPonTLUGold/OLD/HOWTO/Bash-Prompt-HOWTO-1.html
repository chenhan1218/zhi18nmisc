<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction and Administrivia</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>You will need Bash.  The default version for most distributions is either
1.14.7, or 2.0.x.  1.14.7 was the standard for years, but is slowly being
replaced.  I've been using Bash 2.0.x for quite a while now, but almost all
code presented here should work under 1.14.7.  If I'm aware of a problem,
I'll mention it.  You can check your Bash version by typing <CODE>echo
$BASH_VERSION</CODE> at the prompt.  On my machine, it responds with
<CODE>2.03.6(1)-release</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Shell programming experience would be good, but isn't essential: the more
you know, the more complex the prompts you'll be able to create.  I assume
a basic knowledge of shell programming and Unix utilities as I go through
this tutorial.  However, my own shell programming skills are limited, so I
give a lot of examples and explanation that may appear unnecessary to an
experienced shell programmer.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 How To Use This Document</A>
</H2>

<P>I include a lot of examples and explanatory text.  Different parts will be
of varying usefulness to different people.  This has grown long enough that
reading it straight through would be difficult - just read the sections you
need, backtrack as necessary.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Problems</A>
</H2>

<P>This is a list of problems I've noticed while programming prompts.  Don't
start reading here, and don't let this list discourage you -
these are mostly quite minor details.  Just check back if you run into
anything odd.
<P>

<LI>Many Bash features (such as math within $(()) among others) are
compile time options.  If you're using a binary distribution such as comes
with a standard Linux distribution, all such features should be compiled
in.  But if you're working on someone else's system, this is worth keeping
in mind if something you expected to work doesn't.  Some notes about this
in <EM>Learning the Bash Shell</EM>, p.260-262.
</LI>
<LI>The terminal screen manager "screen" doesn't always get along with
ANSI colours.  I'm not a screen expert, unfortunately.  My current version
of screen (3.7.6-1, an RPM package) seems to work well in all cases, but
I've seen occasions where screen reduced all prompt colours to the standard
foreground colour in X terminals.  This doesn't appear to be a problem on
the console.
</LI>
<LI>Xdefaults files can override colours.  Look in ~/.Xdefaults for
lines referring to XTerm*background and XTerm*foreground (or possibly
XTerm*Background and XTerm*Foreground).
</LI>
<LI>One of the prompts mentioned in this document uses the output of
"jobs" - as discussed at that time, "jobs" output to a pipe is broken in
Bash 2.02.
</LI>
<LI>ANSI cursor movement escape sequences aren't all implemented in all X
terminals.  That's discussed in its own section.
</LI>
<LI>Some nice looking pseudo-graphics can be created by using a VGA font
rather than standard Linux fonts.  Unfortunately, these effects look awful
if you don't use a VGA font, and there's no way to detect within a term
what kind of font it's using.
</LI>
<LI>Bash 2.0+ is out, and it incorporates some new features, and changes
some behaviour.  Things that work under 1.14.7 don't necessarily work the
same under 2.0+, or vice versa.
</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Send Me Comments and Suggestions</A>
</H2>

<P>This is a learning experience for me.  I've come to know a fair bit about
what can be done to create interesting and useful Bash Prompts, but I need
your input to correct and improve this document.  I've tried to check
suggestions I make against different versions of Bash (2.0x and 1.14.7),
but let me know of any incompatibilities you find.
<P>
<P>The latest version of 
this document should always be available at
<A HREF="http://www.interlog.com/~giles/bashprompt/">http://www.interlog.com/~giles/bashprompt/</A>.  Please check this
out, and feel free to e-mail me at 
<A HREF="mailto:giles@interlog.com">giles@interlog.com</A> with 
suggestions.
<P>
<P>I use the Linux Documentation Project HOWTOs almost exclusively in the HTML
format, so when I convert this from SGML (its native format), HTML is the
only format I check thoroughly.  If there are problems with other formats,
I may not know about them, and I'd appreciate a note about them.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 Credits</A>

<P>In producing this document, I have borrowed heavily from the work of
the Bashprompt project at 
<A HREF="http://bash.current.nu/">http://bash.current.nu/</A>.  Other
sources used include the <EM>xterm Title mini-HOWTO</EM> by
Ric Lister, available at

<P>
<P>Also of immense help were several conversations and e-mails from Dan,
an ex-co-worker at Georgia College &amp; State University, whose knowledge 
of Unix far exceeds mine.  He's given me several excellent suggestions,
and ideas of his have led to some interesting prompts.
<P>
<P>Three books that have been very useful while programming prompts are
<EM>Linux in a Nutshell</EM> by Jessica Heckman Perry (O'Reilly, 1997),
<EM>Learning the Bash Shell</EM> by Cameron Newham and Bill Rosenblatt
(O'Reilly, 2nd. ed., 1998) and <EM>Unix Shell Programming</EM> by Lowell
Jay Arthur (Wiley, 1986.  This is the first edition, the fourth came out in
1997).
