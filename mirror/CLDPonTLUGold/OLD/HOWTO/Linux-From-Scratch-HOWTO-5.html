<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Making the LFS system bootable</A> </H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Installing Sysvinit</A>
 </H2>

<P>Under normal circumstances, after the kernel is done loading and initializing
various system components, it attempts to load a program called <CODE>init</CODE> which
will finalize the system boot process. The package found on most if not every
single Linux system is called Sysvinit and that's the program we're going to
install on our LFS system.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the Sysvinit archive</LI>
<LI>Enter the src directory</LI>
<LI>Edit the <CODE>Makefile</CODE> file</LI>
<LI>Somewhere in this file, but before the rule <EM>all:</EM> put this line: <EM>ROOT =
$LFS</EM></LI>
<LI>Precede every /dev on the last four lines in this file by <EM>$(ROOT)</EM></LI>
</UL>
<P>After applying the $(ROOT) parts to the last four lines, they should
look like this:
<P>
<PRE>
   @if [! -p $(ROOT)/dev/initctl ]; then \
   echo "Creating $(ROOT)/dev/initctl"; \
   rm -f $(ROOT)/dev/initctl; \
   mknod -m 600 $(ROOT)/dev/initctl p; fi
 
</PRE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Install the package by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
make -e LDFLAGS=-static; make install
 
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Configuring Sysvinit</A>
 </H2>

<P>In order for Sysvinit to work, we need to create it's configuration file.
Create the <CODE>$LFS/etc/inittab</CODE> file containing the following:
<P>
<PRE>
# Begin /etc/inittab
 
id:2:initdefault:
 
ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -r now
 
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/sulogin
 
# End /etc/inittab
 
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Creating passwd &amp; group files</A>
 </H2>

<P>As you can see from the inittab file, when we boot the system, init will
start the sulogin program and sulogin will ask you for user root's password.
This means we need to have at least a passwd file present on the LFS system.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create the $LFS/etc/passwd file containing the following: <EM>root:s394ul1Bkvmq2:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash</EM></LI>
<LI>Create the $LFS/etc/group file containing the following: <EM>root::0:</EM></LI>
</UL>
<P>The encoded password string above is: <EM>lfs123</EM>
<P>When you logon to your LFS system, enter <EM>lfs123</EM> when asked to enter user
root's password.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Installing the Bash shell</A>
 </H2>

<P>When sulogin asks you for the root password and you've entered the password,
a shell needs to be started. Usually this is the bash shell. Since there are
no libraries installed yet, we need to link bash statically, just like we did
with Sysvinit.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the Bash archive</LI>
<LI>Install Bash by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
./configure --enable-static-link
make; make -e prefix=$LFS/usr install
mv $LFS/usr/bin/bash $LFS/bin 
cd $LFS/bin; ln -s bash sh
 
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Adding an entry to LILO</A>
 </H2>

<P>In order to being able to boot from this partition, we need to update our
<CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> file. Add the following lines to lilo.conf:
<P>
<PRE>
image=&lt;currently used image&gt;
   label=&lt;label&gt;
   root=$LFS
   read-only
 
</PRE>
<P>Replace &lt;currently used image&gt; by the kernel image file that you
are using to boot your normal Linux system. &lt;label&gt; can be anything you
want it to be. I named the label &quot;lfs&quot; What you enter as &lt;label&gt;
is what you enter at the LILO-prompt when you choose with system to boot.
<P>Now run the <CODE>lilo</CODE> program to update the boot loader.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Testing the system</A>
 </H2>

<P>After you've completed this section, we can test the system by rebooting
into LFS and see if we can log on to it. When you reboot and are at the LILO
prompt, enter the label you have entered in the lilo.conf file to start the
LFS system. Then enter root's password and you should be on the bash-prompt
now. You won't be able to shutdown the system with a program like shutdown.
Although the program is present, it will give you the following error: &quot;You
don't exist. Go away.&quot; when you try to use the program. The meaning of
this error is that the system isn't able to locate the password file. Although
the shutdown program is statically linked against the libraries it needs, it
still depends on the NSS Library (Name Server Switch) which is part of the
GNU C Library, which will be installed in a later chapter. This NSS library
passes on information where (in this case) the passwd file can be found.
<P>For now you can reboot the system using the <CODE>reboot -f</CODE> command. This will
bypass shutting down the system using the shutdown program and reboot immediately.
Since the file system is mounted read-only this will not harm our system in
any way (though you might get a warning next time you try to mount the system
that it wasn't unmounted cleanly the last time and that you should run e2fsck
to make sure the file system is still intact).
