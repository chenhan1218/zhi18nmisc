<H2><A NAME="s14">14. Configuring <EM>axspawn</EM>.</A></H2>

<P>The <EM>axspawn</EM> program is a simple program that allows AX.25 stations
who connect to be logged in to your machine. It may be invoked from the
<EM>ax25d</EM> program as described above in a manner similar to the <EM>node</EM>
program. To allow a user to log in to your
machine you should add a line similar to the following into your
<CODE>/etc/ax25/ax25d.conf</CODE> file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
default * * * * * 1 root /usr/sbin/axspawn axspawn %u
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If the line ends in the <CODE>+</CODE> character then the connecting user must
hit return before they will be allowed to login. The default is to not wait.
Any individual host configurations that follow this line will have the
<EM>axspawn</EM> program run when they connect. When <EM>axspawn</EM> is
run it first checks that the command line argument it is supplied is a legal
callsign, strips the SSID, then it checks that <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file to
see if that user has an account configured. If there is an account, and the
password is either <CODE>""</CODE> (null) or <CODE>+</CODE> then the user is logged
in, if there is anything in the password field the user is prompted to enter
a password. If there is not an existing account in the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE>
file then <EM>axspawn</EM> may be configured to automatically create one.

</H2>

<P>You can alter the behaviour of <EM>axspawn</EM> in various ways by use of
the <CODE>/etc/ax25/axspawn.conf</CODE> file. This file is formatted as
follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /etc/ax25/axspawn.conf
#
# allow automatic creation of user accounts
create    yes
#
# guest user if above is 'no' or everything else fails. Disable with "no"
guest     no
#
# group id or name for autoaccount
group     ax25
#
# first user id to use
first_uid 2001
#
# maximum user id
max_uid   3000
#
# where to add the home directory for the new users
home      /home/ax25
#
# user shell
shell     /bin/bash
#
# bind user id to callsign for outgoing connects.
associate yes
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The eight configurable characteristics of <EM>axspawn</EM> are as follows:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>#</B><DD><P>indicates a comment.
<DT><B>create</B><DD><P>if this field is set to <CODE>yes</CODE> then <EM>axspawn</EM>
will attempt to automatically create a user account for any user who connects
and does not already have an entry in the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file.
<DT><B>guest</B><DD><P>this field names the login name of the account that will
be used for people who connect who do not already have accounts if
<EM>create</EM> is set to <CODE>no</CODE>. This is usually <CODE>ax25</CODE> or
<CODE>guest</CODE>.
<DT><B>group</B><DD><P>this field names the group name that will be used for any
users who connect and do not already have an entry in the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE>
file.
<DT><B>first_uid</B><DD><P>this is the number of the first userid that will be
automatically created for new users.
<DT><B>max_uid</B><DD><P>this is the maximum number that will be used for the userid
of new users.
<DT><B>home</B><DD><P>this is the home (login) directory of new users.
<DT><B>shell</B><DD><P>this is the login shell of any new users.
<DT><B>associate</B><DD><P>this flag indicates whether outgoing AX.25 connections
made by this user after they login will use their own callsign, or your
stations callsign.
