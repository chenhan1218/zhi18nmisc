<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What's in here?</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux is well known for being difficult and, generally, user
hostile. Being a bit of a Unix fan I'm not sure whether I agree with
that or not.
<P>Oracle is similar I guess. Initially it's difficult to get to grips
with, but it's difficult to work with any other RDBMS when you're used
to it.
<P>Combine the two, remember that 8i is only the second production
release, and you realise that this isn't going to be straight-forward,
even if you're familiar with both.
<P>I am, but I had problems. Many problems were my own stupidity or
hubris, but I document them for completeness.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Who is this HOWTO for?</A>
</H2>

<P>First, this document is for people who want to install Oracle 8i
version 8.1.5 on Linux. It does not cover any earlier versions,
although it should work with similar later versions such as 8.1.6.
<P>If you want to install 8.0, I recommend you try 
<A HREF="http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue67/3572.html">Linux Journals guide</A>, and
if you want to install any of the previous versions you're going to
have to use the SCO version and follow Paul Haigh's 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Oracle-HOWTO.html">Oracle Database HOWTO</A>.
<P>If you're trying to install the 'right' version, what level of
background knowledge will you need?
<P>Perhaps the easiest way is if I explain a little of my background,
clearly if yours is similar we're going to be on the same
wave-length. I've used a lot of Unix and Oracle over the last few
years. At home I've been running Linux since 1994 and I've been using
Solaris and HP-UX on-and-off since 1992. I first came across Oracle in
1996 and have worked with both versions 7 and 8. I'm mainly a
developer, but I have done DBA and sysadmin-type work.
<P>In summary, I can find my way around a Unix box and I know much of the
Oracle terminology. You'll need both to brave the rest of this
document. But don't worry if you have a different background, follow
this guide closely and keep asking questions. The Linux community are
a helpful bunch, just don't expect an answer if you haven't at least
made an effort to solve the problem yourself.
<P>

<P>Things move quickly in the world of Linux and Oracle, meaning that
this document can quickly get out of date. If this document is more
than a month or two old, I suggest you take a look at
