<P>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P> Don't ever use <CODE>setserial</CODE> with Laptops (PCMCIA).
<CODE>setserial</CODE> is a program which allows you to tell the device driver
software the I/O address of the serial port, which interrupt (IRQ) is
set in the port's hardware, what type of UART you have, etc.  Since
theres a good chance that the serial ports will be automatically
detected and set, many people never need to use <CODE>setserial</CODE>.  In
any case setserial will not work without either serial support built
into the kernel or loaded as a module.  The module may get loaded
automatically if you (or a script) tries to use setserial.
<P>Setserial can also show how the driver is currently set.  In addition,
it can be made to probe the hardware and try to determine the UART
type and IRQ, but this has severe limitations.  See 
<A HREF="#probing_ss">Probing</A>.  Note that it can't set the IRQ or
the port address in the hardware of PnP serial ports (but the
plug-and-play features of the serial driver may do this).
<P>If you only have one or two built-in serial ports, they will usually
get set up correctly without using setserial.  Otherwise, if you add
more serial ports (such as a modem card) you will likely need to deal
with setserial.  Besides the man page for <CODE>setserial</CODE>, check out
info in <CODE>/usr/doc/setserial.../</CODE> or
<CODE>/usr/share/doc/setserial</CODE>.  It should tell you how setserial
is handled in your distribution of Linux.  
<P><CODE>Setserial</CODE> is often run automatically at boot-time by a start-up
shell-script for the purpose of assigning IRQs, etc. to the driver.
Setserial will only work if the serial module is loaded (or if the
equivalent was compiled into your kernel).  If the serial module gets
unloaded later on, the changes previously made by <CODE>setserial</CODE> will
be forgotten by the kernel.  But recent (2000) distributions may
contain scripts that save and restore this.  If not, then
<CODE>setserial</CODE> must be run again to reestablish them.  In addition to
running via a start-up script, something akin to <CODE>setserial</CODE> also
runs earlier when the serial module is loaded (or the like).  Thus
when you watch the start-up messages on the screen it may look like it
ran twice, and in fact it has.
<P>Setserial can set the time that the port will keep operating after
it's closed (in order to output any characters still in its buffer in
main RAM).  This is needed at slow baud rates of 1200 or lower.  It's
also needed at higher speeds if there are a lot of "flow control"
waits.  See "closing_wait" in the man page.
<P>
<P>Setserial does not set either IRQ's nor I/O addresses in the serial
port hardware itself.  That is done either by jumpers or by
plug-and-play.  You must tell setserial the identical values that have
been set in the hardware.  Do not just invent some values that you
think would be nice to use and then tell them to setserial.  However,
if you know the I/O address but don't know the IRQ you may command
setserial to attempt to determine the IRQ.  
<P>You can see a list of possible commands by just typing <CODE>setserial</CODE>
with no arguments.  This fails to show you the one-letter options such
as -v for verbose which you should normally use when troubleshooting.
Note that setserial calls an IO address a "port".  If you type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
setserial -g /dev/ttyS*
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
you'll see some info about how that device driver is configured for
your ports.  Note that where it says <CODE>"UART: unknown"</CODE> it
probably means that no uart exists.  In other words you probably have
no such serial port and the other info shown about the port is
meaningless and should be ignored.  If you really do have such a
serial port, setserial doesn't recognize it and that needs to be
fixed.
<P>If you add -a to the option -g you will see more info although few
people need to deal with (or understand) this additional info since
the default settings you see usually work fine.  In normal cases the
hardware is set up the same way as "setserial" reports, but if you are
having problems there is a good chance that "setserial" has it wrong.
In fact, you can run "setserial" and assign a purely fictitious I/O
port address, any IRQ, and whatever uart type you would like to have.
Then the next time you type "setserial ..." it will display these
bogus values without complaint.  They will also be officially
registered with the kernel as seen by the "scanport" command.
Of course the serial port driver will not work correctly (if at all)
if you attempt to use such a port.  Thus when giving parameters to
"setserial" anything goes.  Well almost.  If you assign one port a
base address that is already assigned (such as 3e8) it will not accept
it.  But if you use 3e9 it will accept it.  Unfortunately 3e9 is
already assigned since it is within the range starting at base address
3e8.  Thus the moral of the story is to make sure of your data before
assigning resources with setserial.
<P>While assignments made by setserial are lost when the PC is powered
off, a configuration file may restore them (or a previous
configuration) when the PC is started up again.  In newer versions,
what you change by setserial gets automatically saved to a
configuration file.  In older versions, the configuration file only
changes if you edit it manually so the configuration remains the same
from boot to boot.  See 
<A HREF="#ss_conf_script">Configuration Scripts/Files</A><P>
<H3><A NAME="probing_ss"></A> Probing </H3>

<P> With appropriate options, <CODE>setserial</CODE> can probe (at a given I/O
address) for a serial port but you must guess the I/O address.  If you
ask it to probe for /dev/ttyS2 for example, it will only probe at the
address it thinks ttyS2 is at (2F8).  If you tell setserial that ttyS2
is at a different address, then it will probe at that address, etc.
See 
<A HREF="#probing_ss">Probing</A><P>The purpose of this is to see if there is a uart there, and if so,
what its IRQ is.  Use "setserial" mainly as a last resort as there are
faster ways to attempt it such as wvdialconf to detect modems, looking
at very early boot-time messages, or using <CODE>pnpdump
--dumpregs</CODE>.  To try to detect the physical hardware use the -v
(verbose) and <CODE>autoconfig</CODE> command to <CODE>setserial</CODE>.  If the
resulting message shows a uart type such as 16550A, then you're OK.
If instead it shows "<CODE>unknown</CODE>" for the uart type, then there is
supposedly no serial port at all at that I/O address.  Some cheap
serial ports don't identify themselves correctly so if you see
"<CODE>unknown</CODE>" you still might have a serial port there.  
<P>Besides auto-probing for a uart type, setserial can auto-probe for
IRQ's but this doesn't always work right either.  In one case it first
gave the wrong irq but when the command was repeated it found the
correct irq.  In versions of setserial >= 2.15, the results of your
last probe test may be saved and put into the configuration file
<CODE>/etc/serial.conf</CODE> which will be used next time you start
Linux.  At boot-time when the serial module loads (or the like), a
probe for UARTs is made automatically and reported on the screen.  But
the IRQs shown may be wrong.  The second report of the same is the
result of a script which usually does no probing and thus provides no
reliable information as to how the hardware is actually set.  It only
shows configuration data someone wrote into the script or data that
got saved in /etc/serial.conf.
<P>It may be that two serial ports both have the same IO address set in
the hardware.  Of course this is not permitted but it sometimes
happens anyway.  Probing detects one serial port when actually there
are two.  However if they have different IRQs, then the probe for IRQs
may show IRQ = 0.  For me it only did this if I first used
<CODE>setserial</CODE> to give the IRQ a ficticious value.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sets_boot_time"></A> Boot-time Configuration  </H3>

<P> When the kernel loads the serial module (or if the "module
equivalent" is built into the kernel) then only <CODE>ttyS{0-3}</CODE> are
auto-detected and the driver is set to use only IRQs 4 and 3
(regardless of what IRQs are actually set in the hardware).  You see
this as a boot-time message just like as if <CODE>setserial</CODE> had been
run.  
<P>To correct possible errors in IRQs (or for other reasons) there may be
a file somewhere that runs <CODE>setserial</CODE> again.  Unfortunately, if
this file has some IRQs wrong, the kernel will still have incorrect
info about the IRQs.  This file should run early at boot-time before
any process uses the serial port.  In fact, your distribution may have
set things up so that the setserial program runs automatically from a
start-up script at boot-time.  More info about how to handle this
situation for your particular distribution might be found in file
named "setserial..." or the like located in directory /usr/doc/ or
/usr/share/doc/.
<P>Before modifying a configuration file, you can test out a "proposed"
<CODE>setserial</CODE> command by just typing it on the command line.  In some
cases the results of this use of <CODE>setserial</CODE> will automatically get
saved in /etc/serial.conf when you shutdown.  So if it worked OK (and
solved your problem) then there's no need to modify any configuration
file.  See 
<A HREF="#new_config">New configuration method using /etc/serial.conf</A>. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss_conf_script"></A> Configuration Scripts/Files </H3>

<P> Your objective is to modify (or create) a script file in the /etc
tree that runs setserial at boot-time.  Most distributions provide
such a file (but it may not initially reside in the /etc tree).  In
addition, setserial 2.15 and higher often have an /etc/serial.conf
file that is used by the above script so that you don't need to
directly edit the script that runs setserial.  In addition just using
setserial on the command line (2.15+) may ultimately alter this
configuration file.
<P>So prior to version 2.15 all you do is edit a script.  After 2.15 you
may need to either do one of three things: 1. edit a script.  2. edit
<CODE>/etc/serial.conf</CODE> or 3. run "setserial" on the command line
which may result in <CODE>/etc/serial.conf</CODE> automatically being
edited.  Which one of these you need to do depends on both your
particular distribution, and how you have set it up.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="old_sets_script"></A> Edit a script (required prior to version 2.15) </H3>

<P> Prior to setserial 2.15 (1999) there was no /etc/serial.conf file
to configure setserial.   Thus you need to find the file that runs
"setserial" at boot time and edit it.  If it doesn't exist, you need
to create one (or place the commands in a file that runs early at
boot-time).  If such a file is currently being used it's likely
somewhere in the /etc directory-tree.  But Redhat &lt;6.0 has supplied it
in /usr/doc/setserial/ but you need to move it to the /etc tree before
using it.   You might use "locate" to try to find such a file.  For
example, you could type: locate "*serial*".   
<P>The script <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.serial</CODE> was commonly used in the past.
The Debian distribution used <CODE>/etc/rc.boot/0setserial</CODE>.
Another file once used was <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</CODE> but it's
not a good idea to use this since it may not be run early enough.
It's been reported that other processes may try to open the serial
port before rc.local runs resulting in serial communication failure.
Today it's most likely in /etc/init.d/ but it isn't normally intended
to be edited.
<P>If such a file is supplied, it should contain a number of
commented-out examples.  By uncommenting some of these and/or
modifying them, you should be able to set things up correctly.  Make
sure that you are using a valid path for <CODE>setserial</CODE>, and a valid
device name.  You could do a test by executing this file manually
(just type its name as the super-user) to see if it works right.
Testing like this is a lot faster than doing repeated reboots to get
it right.  
<P>For versions >= 2.15 (provided your distribution implemented the
change, Redhat didn't) it may be more tricky to do since the file that
runs setserial on startup, /etc/init.d/setserial or the like was not
intended to be edited by the user.  See 
<A HREF="#new_config">New configuration method using /etc/serial.conf</A>. 
<P>If you want setserial to automatically determine the uart and the IRQ
for ttyS3 you would add something like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/sbin/setserial  /dev/ttyS3 auto_irq skip_test autoconfig
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
Do this for every serial port you want to auto configure.  Be sure to
give a device name that really does exist on your machine.  In some
cases this will not work right due to the hardware.  If you know what
the uart and irq actually are, you may want to assign them explicitly
with "setserial".  For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/sbin/setserial /dev/ttyS3 irq 5 uart 16550A  skip_test 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="new_config"></A> New configuration method using /etc/serial.conf </H3>

<P> Prior to setserial version 2.15, the way to configure setserial
was to manually edit the shell-script that ran setserial at boot-time.
See 
<A HREF="#old_sets_script">Edit a script (after version 2.15: perhaps not)</A>.  Starting with version 2.15 (1999) of <CODE>setserial</CODE>
this shell-script is not edited but instead gets its data from a
configuration file: <CODE>/etc/serial.conf</CODE>.  Furthermore you may
not even need to edit serial.conf because using the "setserial"
command on the command line may automatically cause serial.conf to be
edited appropriately.
<P>This was intended to make it so that you don't need to edit any file
in order to set up (or change) setserial so it will do the right thing
each time that Linux is booted.  But there are serious pitfalls
because it's not really "setserial" that edits serial.conf.  Confusion
is compounded because different distributions handle this differently.
In addition, you may modify it so it works differently.
<P>What often happens is this:  When you shut down your PC the script
that runs "setserial" at boot-time is run again, but this time it only
does what the part for the "stop" case says to do:  It uses
"setserial" to find out what the current state of "setserial" is and
puts that info into the <CODE>serial.conf</CODE> file.  Thus when you run
"setserial" to change the serial.conf file, it doesn't get changed
immediately but only when and if you shut down normally.
<P>Now you can perhaps guess what problems might occur.  Suppose you
don't shut down normally (someone turns the power off, etc.) and the
changes don't get saved.  Suppose you experiment with "setserial" and
forget to run it a final time to restore the original state (or make a
mistake in restoring the original state).  Then your "experimental"
settings are saved.  
<P>If you manually edit serial.conf, then your editing is destroyed when
you shut down because it gets changed back to the state of setserial
at shutdown.  There is a way to disable the changing of serial.conf at
shutdown and that is to remove "###AUTOSAVE###" or the like from first
line of serial.conf.  In at least one distribution, the removal of 
"###AUTOSAVE###" from the first line is automatically done after the
first time you shutdown just after installation.  The serial.conf file
will hopefully contain some comments to help you out.
<P>The file most commonly used to run setserial at boot-time (in
conformance with the configuration file) is now /etc/init.d/setserial
(Debian) or /etc/init.d/serial (Redhat), or etc.,  but it should not
normally be edited.  For 2.15 Redhat 6.0 just had a file
/usr/doc/setserial-2.15/rc.serial which you have to move to
/etc/init.d/ if you want setserial to run at boot-time.
<P>To disable a port, use <CODE>setserial</CODE> to set it to
"uart none".  The format of /etc/serial.conf appears to be just like
that of the parameters placed after "setserial" on the command line
with one line for each port.  If you don't use autosave, you may edit
/etc/serial.conf manually.  
<P>BUG: As of July 1999 there is a bug/problem since with ###AUTOSAVE###
only the setserial parameters displayed by "setserial -Gg /dev/ttyS*"
get saved but the other parameters don't get saved.  Use the -a flag
to "setserial" to see all parameters.  This will only affect a small
minority of users since the defaults for the parameters not saved are
usually OK for most situations.  It's been reported as a bug and may
be fixed by now. 
<P>In order to force the current settings set by setserial to be saved to
the configuration file (serial.conf) without shutting down, do what
normally happens when you shutdown: Run the shell-script
<CODE>/etc/init.d/{set}serial stop</CODE>.  The "stop" command will save
the current configuration but the serial ports still keep working OK.
<P>In some cases you may wind up with both the old and new configuration
methods installed but hopefully only one of them runs at boot-time.
Debian labeled obsolete files with "...pre-2.15".
<P>
<H3>IRQs</H3>

<P> By default, both ttyS0 and ttyS2 will share IRQ 4, while ttyS1 and
ttyS3 share IRQ 3.  But actually sharing serial interrupts (using them
in running programs) is not permitted unless you: 1. have kernel 2.2
or better, and 2. you've complied in support for this, and 3. your
serial hardware supports it.  See 
<P>
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-6.html#int_share-2.2">Interrupt sharing and Kernels 2.2+</A><P>If you only have two serial ports, ttyS0 and ttyS1, you're still OK
since IRQ sharing conflicts don't exist for non-existent devices.  
<P>If you add an internal modem and retain ttyS0 and ttyS1,
then you should attempt to find an unused IRQ and set it both on your
serial port (or modem card) and then use setserial to assign it to
your device driver.  If IRQ 5 is not being used for a sound card, this
may be one you can use for a modem.  To set the IRQ in hardware you
may need to use isapnp, a PnP BIOS, or patch Linux to make it PnP.  To
help you determine which spare IRQ's you might have, type "man
setserial" and search for say: "IRQ 11".

<H2><A NAME="stty_"></A> <A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Stty </A>
 </H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P> <CODE>stty</CODE> does much of the configuration of the serial port but
since application programs (and the getty program) often handle it,
you may not need to use it much.  It's handy if your having problems
or want to see how the port is set up.  Try typing ``stty -a'' at your
terminal/console to see how it's now set.  Also try typing it without
the -a (all) for a short listing which shows how it's set different
than normal.  Don't try to learn all the setting unless you want to
become a serial guru.  Most of the defaults should work OK and some of
the settings are needed only for certain obsolete dumb terminals made
in the 1970's.  
<P><CODE>stty</CODE> is documented in the man pages with a more detailed account
in the info pages.  Type <CODE>"man stty"</CODE> or <CODE>"info stty"</CODE>.
<P>Whereas <CODE>setserial</CODE> only deals with actual serial ports, stty is
used both for serial ports and for virtual terminals such as the standard
Linux text interface at a PC monitor.  For the PC monitor, many of the
stty settings are meaningless.  Changing the baud rate, etc. doesn't
appear to actually do anything.
<P>Here are some of the items stty configures: speed (bits/sec), parity,
bits/byte, # of stop bits, strip 8th bit?, modem control signals, flow
control, break signal, end-of-line markers, change case, padding, beep
if buffer overrun?, echo what you type to the screen, allow background
tasks to write to terminal?, define special (control) characters (such
as what key to press for interrupt).  See the <CODE>stty</CODE> man or info
page for more details.  Also see the man page: <CODE>termios</CODE> which
covers the same options set by stty but (as of mid 1999) covers
features which the stty man page fails to mention.  
<P>With some implementations of getty (getty_ps package), the commands
that one would normally give to stty are typed into a getty
configuration file: /etc/gettydefs.  Even without this configuration
file, the getty command line may be sufficient to set things up so
that you don't need stty."')
<P>One may write C programs which change the stty configuration, etc.
Looking at some of the documentation for this may help one better
understand the use of the stty command (and its many possible
arguments).  Serial-Programming-HOWTO is useful.  The manual page:
termios contains a description of the C-language structure (of type
termios) which stores the stty configuration in computer memory.  Many
of the flag names in this C-structure are almost the same (and do the
same thing) as the arguments to the stty command.
<P>
<H3>Using stty at a "foreign" terminal</H3>

<P> Using <CODE>stty</CODE> to configure the terminal that you are currently
using is easy.  Doing it for a different (foreign) terminal or serial
port may be tricky.  For example, let's say you are at the PC monitor
(tty1) and want to use <CODE>stty</CODE> to deal with the serial port ttyS2.
Prior to about 2000 you needed to use the redirection operator "&lt;".
After 2000 (provided your version of setserial is >= 1.17 and stty >=
2.0) there is a better method using the -F option.  This will work
when the old redirection method fails.  Even with the latest versions
be warned that if there is a terminal on ttyS2 and a shell is running
on that terminal, then what you see will likely be deceptive and
trying to set it will not work.  See 
<A HREF="#2_term_interfaces">Two interfaces at a terminal</A> to understand it.
<P>The new method is ``stty -F /dev/ttyS2 ...'' (or --file instead of F).
If  ... is -a it displays all the stty settings.  The old redirection
method (which still works in later versions) is to type ``stty ... &lt;/dev/ttyS2''.   If the new method works but the old one hangs, it
implies that the port is hung due to lack of a modem control line from
being asserted.  Thus the old method is still useful for
troubleshooting.  See the following subsection.
<P>
<H3>Old redirection method</H3>

<P> Here's a problem with the old redirection operator (which doesn't
happen if you use the newer -F option instead).  Sometimes when trying
to use stty, the command hangs and nothing happens (you don't get a
prompt for a next command even after hitting &lt;return&gt;).  This is
likely due to the port being stuck because it's waiting for one of the
modem control lines to be asserted.  For example, unless you've set
"clocal" to ignore modem control lines, then if no CD signal is
asserted the port will not open and stty will not work for it (unless
you use the newer -F option).  A similar situation seems to exist for
hardware flow control.  If the cable for the port doesn't even have a
conductor for the pin that needs to be asserted then there is no easy
way to stop the hang.
<P>One way to try to get out of the above hang is to use the newer -F
option and set "clocal" and/or "crtscts".  If you don't have the -F
option then you may try to run program on the port that will force it
to operate even if the control lines say not to.  Then hopefully this
program might set the port so it doesn't need the control signal in
the future in order to open: clocal or -crtscts.  To use "minicom" to
do this you have to reconfigure minicom for another ttyS, etc, and
then exit it and restart it.  Since you then have to reconfigure
minicom again, it may be simpler to just reboot the PC.
<P>The old redirection method makes ttyS2 the standard input to stty.
This gives the stty program a link to the "file" ttyS2 so that it may
"read" it.  But instead of reading the bytes sent to ttyS2 as one
might expect, it uses the link to find the configuration settings of
the port so that it may read or change them.  Some people tried to use
``stty ... &gt; /dev/ttyS2'' to set the terminal.  This will not do it.
Instead, it takes the message normal displayed by the stty command for
the terminal you are on (say tty1) and sends this message to ttyS2.
But it doesn't change any settings for ttyS2.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="2_term_interfaces"></A> Two interfaces at a terminal </H3>

<P> When using a shell (such as bash) with command-line-editing
enabled there are two different terminal interfaces (what you see when
you type stty -a).  When you type in modern shells at the command line
you have a temporary "raw" interface (or raw mode) where each
character is read by the command-line-editor as you type it.  Once you
hit the &lt;return&gt; key, the command-line-editor is exited and the
terminal interface is changed to the nominal "cooked" interface
(cooked mode) for the terminal.  This cooked mode lasts until the next
prompt is sent to the terminal.  Note that one never gets to type
anything to this cooked mode but what was typed in raw mode becomes
cooked mode as soon as one hits the &lt;return&gt; key.
<P>When a prompt is sent to the terminal the terminal goes from "cooked"
to "raw" mode (just like it does when you start an editor since you
are starting the command-line editor).  The settings for the "raw"
mode are based only on the basic settings taken from the "cooked"
mode.  Raw mode keeps these setting but changes several other settings
in order to change the mode to "raw".  It is not at all based on the
settings used in the previous "raw" mode.  Thus if one uses stty to
change settings for the raw mode, such settings will be lost as soon
as one hits the &lt;return&gt; key at the terminal that has supposedly
been "set".
<P>Now when one types stty to look at the terminal interface, one may
either get a view of the cooked mode or the raw mode.  You need to
figure out which one you're looking at.  It you use stty from another
terminal to deal with a terminal that is displaying a command line,
then you will see the raw mode settings.  Any changes made will only
be made to the raw mode and will be lost when someone presses
&lt;return&gt; at the terminal you tried to "set".  But if you type a
stty command at your terminal (without using &lt; for redirection) and
then hit &lt;return&gt; it's a different story.  The &lt;return&gt;
puts the terminal in cooked mode.  Your changes are saved and will
still be there when the terminal goes back into raw mode (unless of
course it's a setting not allowed in raw mode).
<P>This situation can create problems.  For example, suppose you corrupt
your terminal interface and to restore it you go to another terminal
and "stty -F dev/ttyS1 sane" (or the like) to restore it.  It will not
work!  Of course you can try to type "stty sane ..." at the terminal
that is corrupted but you can't see what you typed.  All the above not
only applies to dumb terminals but to virtual terminals used on a PC
Monitor as well as to the terminal windows in X.  In other words, it
applies to almost everyone who uses Linux.
<P>Luckily, when you start up Linux, any file that runs stty at boot-time
will likely deal with a terminal (or serial port with no terminal)
that has no shell running on it so there's no problem for this special
case.

<H3><A NAME="stty_where"></A> Where to put the stty command ? </H3>

<P> Should you need to have <CODE>stty</CODE> set up the serial interface each
time the computer starts up then you need to put the <CODE>stty</CODE> command
in a file that will be executed each time the computer is started up
(Linux boots).  It should be run before the serial port is used
(including running getty on the port).  There are many possible places
to put it.  If it gets put in more than one place and you only know
about (or remember) one of those places, then a conflict is likely.
So make sure to document what you do.
<P>One place to put it would be in the same file that runs setserial when
the system is booted.  The location is distribution and version
dependent.  It would seem best to put it after the setserial command
so that the low level stuff is done first.  If you have directories in
the /etc tree where every file in them is executed at boot-time 
(System V Init) then you could create a file named "stty" for this
purpose.

<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 What is isapnp ?</A>
</H2>

<P> <CODE>isapnp</CODE> is a program to configure Plug-and-Play (PnP) devices
on the ISA bus including internal modems.  It comes in a package
called "isapnptools" and includes another program, "pnpdump" which
finds all your ISA PnP devices and shows you options for configuring
them in a format which may be added to the PnP configuration file:
/etc/isapnp.conf.  The isapnp command may be put into a startup file
so that it runs each time you start the computer and thus will
configure ISA PnP devices.  It is able to do this even if your BIOS
doesn't support PnP.  See Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.
