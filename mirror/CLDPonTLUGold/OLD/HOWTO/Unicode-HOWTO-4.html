<P>
<P>In some installations, telnet is not 8-bit clean by default.
In order to be able to send Unicode keystrokes to the remote host, you need to
set telnet into "outbinary" mode.
There are two ways to do this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

and

(an interactive tool for connection setup, telnet, file transfer,

in versions 7.0 or newer, understands the file and transfer encodings
UTF-8 and UCS-2, and understands the terminal encoding UTF-8, and converts
between these encodings and many others. Documentation of these features

<H3>Mozilla</H3>

<P>
<P>Mozilla milestone M16 has much better internationalization than Netscape 4.
It can display HTML documents in UTF-8 encoding with support for more
languages. Alas, there is a cosmetic problem with CJK fonts: some glyphs
can be bigger than the line's height, thus overlapping the previous or next
line.

<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/">http://www.mozilla.org/</A><P>
<H3>lynx</H3>

<P>
<P>lynx-2.8 has an options screen (key 'O') which permits to set the display
character set. When running in an xterm or Linux console in UTF-8 mode,
set this to "UNICODE UTF-8". Note that for this setting to take effect
in the current browser session, you have to confirm on the "Accept Changes"
field, and for this setting to take effect in future browser sessions, you
have to enable the "Save options to disk" field and then confirm it on
the "Accept Changes" field.
<P>Now, again, all a document needs is the following line between the
&lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; tags:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When you are viewing text files in UTF-8 encoding, you also need to
pass the command-line option "-assume_local_charset=UTF-8" (affects only
file:/... URLs) or "-assume_charset=UTF-8" (affects all URLs).
In lynx-2.8.2 you can alternatively, in the options screen (key 'O'),
change the assumed document character set to "utf-8".
<P>There is also an option in the options screen, to set the "preferred document
character set". But it has no effect, at least with file:/... URLs
and with http://... URLs served by apache-1.3.0.
<P>There is a spacing and line-breaking problem, however. (Look at the
russian section of x-utf8.html, or at utf-8-demo.txt.)
<P>Also, in lynx-2.8.2, configured with --enable-prettysrc, the nice colour
scheme does not work correctly any more when the display character set
has been set to "UNICODE UTF-8". This is fixed by a simple patch
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/lynx282.diff">lynx282.diff</A>.
<P>The Lynx developers say: "For any serious use of UTF-8 screen output with
lynx, compiling with slang lib and -DSLANG_MBCS_HACK is still recommended."

is a text mode browser for HTML pages and plain-text files.
Its layout of HTML tables, enumerations etc. is much prettier than lynx' one.
w3m can also be used as a high quality HTML to plain text converter.
<P>w3m 0.1.10 has command line options for the three major Japanese encodings, but
can also be used for UTF-8 encoded files. Without command line options,
you often have to press Ctrl-L to refresh the display, and line breaking
in Cyrillic and CJK paragraphs is not good.

<P>
<P>yudit by G&aacute;sp&aacute;r Sinai
<A HREF="http://czyborra.com/yudit/">http://czyborra.com/yudit/</A>
is a first-class unicode text editor for the X Window System.
It supports simultaneous processing of many languages, input methods,
conversions for local character standards.
It has facilities for entering text in all languages with only
an English keyboard, using keyboard configuration maps.
<P>It can be compiled in three versions: Xlib GUI, KDE GUI, or Motif GUI.
<P>Customization is very easy. Typically you will first customize your font.
From the font menu I chose "Unicode". Then, since the command
"xlsfonts '*-*-iso10646-1'" still showed some ambiguity, I chose a font
size of 13 (to match Markus Kuhn's 13-pixel fixed font).
<P>Next, you will customize your input method. The input methods "Straight",
"Unicode" and "SGML" are most remarkable. For details about the other
built-in input methods, look in /usr/local/share/yudit/data/.
<P>To make a change the default for the next session, edit your $HOME/.yuditrc
file.
<P>The general editor functionality is limited to editing, cut&amp;paste
and search&amp;replace. No undo.
<P>yudit can display text using a TrueType font; see section "TrueType fonts"
above. The Bitstream Cyberbit gives good results. For yudit to find the
font, symlink it to <CODE>/usr/local/share/yudit/data/cyberbit.ttf</CODE>.
<P>
<H3>vim</H3>

<P>
<P>vim (as of version 6.0b) has good support for UTF-8: when started in an
UTF-8 locale, it assumes UTF-8 encoding for the console and the text files
being edited. It supports double-wide (CJK) characters as well and
combining characters and therefore fits perfectly into UTF-8 enabled
xterm.
<P>Installation: Download from
<A HREF="http://www.vim.org/">http://www.vim.org/</A>.
After unpacking the four parts, edit src/Makefile to
include the <CODE>--with-features=big</CODE> option. This will turn on the
features FEAT_MBYTE, FEAT_RIGHTLEFT, FEAT_LANGMAP. Then do "make" and
"make install".
<P>
<H3>emacs</H3>

<P>
<P>First of all, you should read the section "International Character Set Support"
(node "International") in the Emacs manual. In particular, note that you need
to start Emacs using the command
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ emacs -fn fontset-standard
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

so that it will use a font set comprising a lot of international characters.
<P>In the short term, there are two packages for using UTF-8 in Emacs. None
of them needs recompiling Emacs.
<UL>
<LI>The emacs-utf package
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ust.hk/faculty/otfried/Mule/">http://www.cs.ust.hk/faculty/otfried/Mule/</A>
by Otfried Cheong provides a "unicode-utf8" encoding to Emacs.</LI>
<LI>The oc-unicode package
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ust.hk/faculty/otfried/Mule/">http://www.cs.ust.hk/faculty/otfried/Mule/</A>,
by Otfried Cheong, an extension of the Mule-UCS package
<A HREF="ftp://etlport.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/Mule-UCS/Mule-UCS-0.70.tar.gz">ftp://etlport.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/Mule-UCS/Mule-UCS-0.70.tar.gz</A>
(mirrored at
<A HREF="http://riksun.riken.go.jp/archives/misc/mule/Mule-UCS/Mule-UCS-0.70.tar.gz">http://riksun.riken.go.jp/archives/misc/mule/Mule-UCS/Mule-UCS-0.70.tar.gz</A>)
by Miyashita Hisashi, provides a "utf-8" encoding to Emacs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>You can use either of these packages, or both together. The advantages
of the emacs-utf "unicode-utf8" encoding are: it loads faster, and it deals
better with combining characters (important for Thai).
The advantage of the Mule-UCS / oc-unicode "utf-8" encoding is: it can apply
to a process buffer (such as M-x shell), not only to loading and saving of
files; and it respects the widths of characters better (important for
Ethiopian). However, it is less reliable: After heavy editing of a file, I
have seen some Unicode characters replaced with U+FFFD after the file was
saved.
<P>To install the emacs-utf package, compile the program "utf2mule" and install
it somewhere in your $PATH, also install unicode.el, muleuni-1.el,
unicode-char.el somewhere. Then add the lines
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

to your $HOME/.emacs file. To activate any of the font sets, use the Mule
menu item "Set Font/FontSet" or Shift-down-mouse-1. Currently the font sets
with height 15 and 13 have the best Unicode coverage, due to Markus Kuhn's
9x15 and 6x13 fonts. To designate a font set as the initial font set for
the first frame at startup, uncomment the <CODE>set-default-font</CODE> line
in the code snippet above.
<P>To install the oc-unicode package, execute the command
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>Richard Stallman plans to add integrated UTF-8 support to Emacs in the long
term, and so does the XEmacs developers group.
<P>
<H3>xemacs</H3>

<P>
<P>(This section is written by Gilbert Baumann.)
<P>Here is how to teach XEmacs (20.4 configured with MULE) the UTF-8 encoding.
Unfortunately you need its sources to be able to patch it.
<P>First you need these files provided by Tomohiko Morioka:
<P>
<A HREF="http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Tools/XEmacs/xemacs-21.0-b55-emc-b55-ucs.diff">http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Tools/XEmacs/xemacs-21.0-b55-emc-b55-ucs.diff</A>
and
<A HREF="http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Tools/XEmacs/xemacs-ucs-conv-0.1.tar.gz">http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Tools/XEmacs/xemacs-ucs-conv-0.1.tar.gz</A><P>The .diff is a diff against the C sources. The tar ball is elisp code, 
which provides lots of code tables to map to and from Unicode. As the
name of the diff file suggests it is against XEmacs-21; I needed to
help `patch' a bit. The most notable difference to my XEmacs-20.4
sources is that file-coding.[ch] was called mule-coding.[ch].
<P>For those unfamilar with the XEmacs-MULE stuff (as I am) a quick
guide:
<P>What we call an encoding is called by MULE a `coding-system'. The most
important commands are:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
M-x set-file-coding-system
M-x set-buffer-process-coding-system   [comint buffers]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and the variable `file-coding-system-alist', which guides `find-file'
to guess the encoding used. After stuff was running, the very first
thing I did was 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/utf8/gb-hacks.el">this</A>.
<P>This code looks into the special mode line introduced by -*- somewhere
in the first 600 bytes of the file about to opened; if now there is a
field "Encoding: xyz;" and the xyz encoding ("coding system" in Emacs speak)
exists, choose that. So now you could do e.g.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
;;; -*- Mode: Lisp; Syntax: Common-Lisp; Package: CLEX; Encoding: utf-8; -*-
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and XEmacs goes into utf-8 mode here.
<P>Atfer everything was running I defined \u03BB (greek lambda) as a
macro like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
(defmacro \u03BB (x) `(lambda .,x))

<P>
<H3>xedit</H3>

<P>
<P>With XFree86-4.0.1, xedit is able to edit UTF-8 files if you set the locale
accordingly (see above), and add the line "Xedit*international: true" to
your $HOME/.Xdefaults file.
<P>
<H3>axe</H3>

<P>
<P>As of version 6.1.2, aXe supports only 8-bit locales. If you add the line
"Axe*international: true" to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file, it will simply dump
core.

<H3>mined98</H3>

<P>
<P>mined98 is a small text editor by Michiel Huisjes, Achim M&uuml;ller and
Thomas Wolff.
<A HREF="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/~wolff/mined.html">http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/~wolff/mined.html</A>
It lets you edit UTF-8 or 8-bit encoded files, in an UTF-8 or 8-bit xterm.
It also has powerful capabilities for entering Unicode characters.
<P>mined lets you edit both 8-bit encoded and UTF-8 encoded files. By default
it uses an autodetection heuristic. If you don't want to rely on heuristics,
pass the command-line option <CODE>-u</CODE> when editing an UTF-8 file, or
<CODE>+u</CODE> when editing an 8-bit encoded file. You can change the
interpretation at any time from within the editor: It displays the encoding
("L:h" for 8-bit, "U:h" for UTF-8) in the menu line. Click on the first
of these characters to change it.
<P>mined knows about double-width and combining characters and displays them
correctly.
<P>mined also has very nice pull-down menus. Alas, the "Home", "End", "Delete"
keys do not work.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Mailers</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>MIME: RFC 2279 defines UTF-8 as a MIME charset, which can be transported
under the 8bit, quoted-printable and base64 encodings. The older MIME
UTF-7 proposal (RFC 2152) is considered to be deprecated and should not
be used any further.
<P>Mail clients released after January 1, 1999, should be capable of sending and
displaying UTF-8 encoded mails, otherwise they are considered deficient.
But these mails have to carry the MIME labels
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Simply piping an UTF-8 file into "mail" without caring about the MIME labels
will not work.
<P>Mail client implementors should take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.imc.org/imc-intl/">http://www.imc.org/imc-intl/</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.imc.org/mail-i18n.html">http://www.imc.org/mail-i18n.html</A>.
<P>Now about the individual mail clients (or "mail user agents"):
<P>
<H3>pine</H3>

<P>
<P>The situation for an unpatched pine version 4.10 is as follows.
<P>Pine does not do character set conversions. But it allows you to view
UTF-8 mails in an UTF-8 text window (Linux console or xterm).
<P>Normally, Pine will warn about different character sets each time you view
an UTF-8 encoded mail. To get rid of this warning, choose S (setup), then
C (config), then change the value of "character-set" to UTF-8. This option
will not do anything, except to reduce the warnings, as Pine has no built-in
knowledge of UTF-8.
<P>Also note that Pine's notion of Unicode characters is pretty limited: It
will display Latin and Greek characters, but not other kinds of Unicode
characters.
<P>A patch by Robert Brady
<A HREF="mailto:rwb197@ecs.soton.ac.uk">&lt;rwb197@ecs.soton.ac.uk&gt;</A>
<A HREF="http://www.ents.susu.soton.ac.uk/~robert/pine-utf8-0.1.diff">http://www.ents.susu.soton.ac.uk/~robert/pine-utf8-0.1.diff</A>
adds UTF-8 support to Pine. With this patch, it decodes and prints headers
and bodies properly. The patch depends on the GNOME libunicode
<A HREF="http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/libunicode/">http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/libunicode/</A>.
<P>However, alignment remains broken in many places; replying to a mail does
not cause the character set to be converted as appropriate; and the editor,
pico, cannot deal with multibyte characters.
<P>
<H3>kmail</H3>

<P>
<P>kmail (as of KDE 1.0) does not support UTF-8 mails at all.
<P>
<H3>Netscape Communicator</H3>

<P>
<P>Netscape Communicator's Messenger can send and display mails in UTF-8
encoding, but it needs a little bit of manual user intervention.
<P>To send an UTF-8 encoded mail: After opening the "Compose" window, but before
starting to compose the message, select from the menu
"View -> Character Set -> Unicode (UTF-8)". Then compose the message and
send it.
<P>When you receive an UTF-8 encoded mail, Netscape unfortunately does not
display it in UTF-8 right away, and does not even give a visual clue that

it enables you to use UTF-8 encoded sources as input for TeX. A thousand of

(instead of `latex'), and insert the following lines at the head of
your source input.

Make sure that the environment variable LESSCHARSET is not set (or is set

regenerate this file using the `lesskey' command, or unset the LESSKEY

is a file viewer with builtin character set converters. To view UTF-8 files
in an UTF-8 console, use "lv -Au8". But it can also be used to view
files in other CJK encodings in an UTF-8 console.
<P>There is a small glitch: lv turns off xterm's cursor and doesn't turn it on

<P>The Li18nux list of commands and utilities that ought to be made interoperable

<P>As of glibc-2.2, regular expressions will only work for 8-bit characters.
In an UTF-8 locale, regular expressions that contain non-ASCII characters
or that expect to match a single multibyte character with "." will not work.
This affects all commands and utilities listed below.
