<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Types of Terminals</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Dumb Terminals</A>
</H2>

<P> There are various conflicting definitions of "dumb terminal" but
as time goes by, more and more terminals are called dumb.  This
document mainly covers text terminals which display only text on the
screen.  It might be titled "Dumb-Terminal-HOWTO" but in some
magazines articles any terminal, no matter how smart, including ones
which present a full graphical user interface (GUI), are called dumb.
If all terminals are "dumb" then there is no point of prefixing the
word "dumb" to terminal (except as a sales pitch to sell computers or
the like in place of "smart" terminals).  Due to the ambiguous meaning
of "dumb terminal" it is not classified here as a type of terminal.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Text Terminals</A>
</H2>

<P> For a text terminal, a 2-way flow of information between the
computer and the terminal takes place over the cable that connects
them together.  This flow is in ASCII bytes where each byte usually
represents a character.  Bytes typed at the keyboard go to the
computer and most bytes from the computer are displayed on the
terminal screen.  Special bytes (or sequences of bytes) from the
computer tell the terminal where to move the cursor to, what to erase,
where to begin and end underlining and/or blinking and/or bold, etc.
There are often hundreds of such special commands and many terminals
can even change fonts.
<P>The communication uses characters (letters) encoded using a code chart
for the character set being used.  Usually, the first 128 bytes out of
256 possible bytes use ASCII codes.  Terminals for Unix-like systems,
normally connect to computers via a cable running between the
asynchronous serial ports (RS-232-C = EIA-232-D) of the host computer
and terminal.  Sometimes the connection is via modem or terminal
server, etc.
<P>Other names for text terminals are "serial terminal", "character-cell
terminal", "character terminal", "ASCII/ANSI terminal", "asynchronous
terminal", "data terminal", "video terminal" and "video display
terminal" (VDT) and "green terminal" (since many used green displays).
In olden days "video display unit" (VDU) was used for terminals but
strictly speaking, it excludes the keyboard.
<P>"Block mode" was used exclusively by old IBM mainframe terminals but
many modern terminals also have this capability (which is not used
much).  The characters you type are temporarily retained in the
terminal memory (and may possibly be edited by a built-in editor at
the terminal).  Then when the send key (or the like) is pressed, a
block of characters (sometimes just a line of characters) is sent to
the computer all at once.  Block mode (as of late 1998) is not
supported by Linux.  See section 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-22.html#block">Block Mode</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Graphic GUI Capabilities of Text Terminals</A>
</H2>

<P> Many text terminals can display bit-mapped images, but not in
color.  Unfortunately, the popular image formats used on the Internet
are not supported.  The protocols for such graphics include: Tektronix
Vector Graphics, ReGIS (DEC), Sixel (DEC), and NAPLPS (North American
Presentation Level Protocol Syntax).
<P>Even without bit-mapped images, ordinary text terminals can sort of
display images.  One may form  arrows &lt;--- and draw boxes with _ and
|.  With special graphic character sets, even more is possible.  By
using all the letters, one may produce "ascii graphics" art.  The term
"graphics terminal" usually means a terminal that can display bit
mapped images.  However, this term is sometimes applied also to
text-only terminals since text is a limited form of graphics.  
<A NAME="vector_graphics"></A> <P>
<H3>Graphics GUI displays</H3>

<P> There are two basic types of graphics displays: raster and vector
(rarely used).  Raster graphics (bit-mapped) puts dots on the screen
by horizontal scan lines drawn by an electron beam (or by activating
pixels or dots on a flat screen).  Vector graphic displays were
intended to be used for monochrome screens that don't have any dots.
They use smart electronics to draw lines and curves with an electron
beam that can move in any direction (at any angle and location).  True
vector graphics draws high quality lines without zig-zags but is both
rare and expensive.  Raster graphics is almost universally used today
for both PCs and text terminals.  For PCs, images encoded in vector
graphic format are sometimes used but they are translated to raster
graphics format for display (with a drop in image quality).

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Thin Clients (Terminals ?)</A>
</H2>

<H3>Introduction </H3>

<P> These are thin (minimal) computers that behave something like
terminals.  Since text terminals (except for very old one) run an
embedded operating system, they are also like a computer.
Thin-clients need more computing power.  In contrast to text-terminals
thin clients all display a modern high-speed GUI.  They are dependent on
more powerful computers (servers) for their operation.  For a true
terminal, the computing work and disk storage will all be done on the
server.  At the other extreme, most of this work and storage is done
at the client but some things such as administration, still depend on
the server.  Since such a client is not really "thin" it's a misnomer
to call it a "thin client".  Some claim that text-terminals are also
thin clients but they are not really since they don't conform to the
client-server model.
<P>Thus a thin client is like a terminal and perhaps should be called a
terminal.  The thin client has a GUI with a mouse that makes it
seem like you are using a computer.  You are, but that computer may be
far away and have many other people using it at the same time you are.
Communication is over a high speed network cable or even over the
Internet.  Some thin clients can, in addition, emulate a text terminal
and have a serial port connector for that purpose.  One even has a USB
interface.
<P>There are two major types of thin clients (and some additional types as
well which will not be discussed here).  One type is the "Window
Terminal" which usually runs under MS software and servers.  The other
type is the "network computer" which is supposed to be platform
neutral.  This implies they should work with both MS Windows and Linux
but early models may not be easy to use with Linux.
<P>
<H3>Window terminals</H3>

<P> These can run under MS Windows NT/2000 using a proprietary protocol.
They are true terminals since all the computing work is done by the
server running Windows.  They are also called "Window-based Terminals"
(WBT).  Some have support for unix-like systems as well and may not
claim to be WBTs (even though they can be used as WBTs).  They are
something like computers since they run an operating system (often
stored in flash memory so it may be updated).  Some can support
X-Windows also and can be used for Linux (from a Linux server).  Many
so called "network computers" can also run X-Windows.  This will be
discussed in the next section.
<P>For displaying the MS-Windows GUI, Citrix was (and is) a major player
with what was called Winterm using it's WinFrame software (which
supported Windows 3.1).  Microsoft licensed some of this and then came
out with Hydra (code name), also known as "Windows Terminal Server".
It works with versions 4 or higher of MS Windows NT.  Then other
companies that had their own proprietary systems for MS Windows
decided to support Microsoft's system.
<P>Citrix uses its ICA protocol and has created an add-on to Hydra known
as pICAsso so that WinFrame (ICA) based terminals can use the Hydra
system.  There exits a ICA client that internally runs Linux (but
connects to a MS Window's server).  Microsoft has substituted RDP
(Remote Desktop Protocol) for ICA.  Citrix has replaced WinFrame with
MetaFrame which supports Windows 95, etc. and is used in conjunction
with "Windows NT Terminal Server Edition".
<P>The above is sometimes called "network computing" since the terminals
and servers connect to each other over a network.  Network computers
may be somewhat different as described below.
<P>
<H3>Network computers (NCs)</H3>

<P>These are neither true computers nor true terminals but are
something in-between.  One type of network computer (NC's) is a
computer with a CPU but no hard Disk.  The OS it needs to run is sent
to it over a network.  NCs are full-graphics and use the services of a
server computer.  They are a little different from terminals since
some of the programs they run may execute on their own CPU chips.
Running a browser was supposed to be one of their primary functions
and thus Java code applets may be sent to them for execution.  Many
NCs support X-Windows so that one may use a Linux server to support
it.  Such a server may be called a "Linux Terminal Server".  IBM
called their NC a "NetStation" but now calls it "NetVista".  They
should work on Intranet type networks and NetVista can run the the
Linux OS.
<P>Wintel came out with a "NetPC" which, unlike the above, is almost a PC
computer.  However, it has no removable disks so users can't install
their own software or obtain copies of anything.  
<P>
<H3>Thin clients under Linux</H3>

<P> Linux provides NFS (Network File System) so that if ordinary
computers are connected to each other via a network, then a person on
one computer can run programs on another computer.  Such a program
sends messages over the network so that it appears just like a
program was being run by your local computer.   But such a program is
actually being run on a computer on the network.  It works also with
X-Windows so that one may see GUI images generated on another
computer.  
<P>Linux also allows a computer to be diskless (see Diskless-HOWTO and
Network-boot-HOWTO) and boot over a network.  Thus using a diskless
computer which runs NFS enables you to run programs on another
computer (the server).  This is just like using a NC (Network
Computer).  It's not really a NC but it's emulating a type of NC.
It's also often called a "terminal" and in some sense it is.  The
server may be called a "terminal server".
<P>Thus if you have an old PC with an ethernet card (NIC) you may be able
to use it as a NC.  The details of this are covered in
Thinclient-HOWTO.  Even if your old PC doesn't have a NIC, you could
still use it to emulate a text-terminal.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-9.html#term_emulation">Terminal Emulation</A>.  
<P>There are also a number of genuine Network Computers (NC) that will
work with a Linux server.  Today some NCs run the Linux OS inside the
NC.  Before Linux became popular, NCs didn't run the Linux OS but
required some other OS.  But even if the NC uses a non-linux OS, it's
often possible to make it work with a Linux Server.  The non-linux OS
is simply stored as files on the Linux Server.  Then when the NC
starts up it sends a message to the Linux Server asking for the
non-linux OS files.  This non-linux OS is thus sent to the NC over the
network and the NC boots.  
<P>The Linux Server runs the NFS and X-Windows both of which must be 
supported by the NC.  This enables one to use the NC as if it were an
X-Window terminal.
<P>There are some Linux HOWTOs for certain brands of NCs:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> JavaStation-HOWTO (by Sun)</LI>
<LI> NC-HOWTO (IBM NetStation)</LI>
<LI> NCD mini-HOWTO (NCD-ThinSTAR)</LI>
<LI> NCD-X-Terminal mini-HOWTO</LI>
<LI> XDM-and-X-Terminal mini-HOWTO</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Hardware hookups</H3>

<P> There are 3 different hardware arrangements for thin clients.
One just uses a PC computer as a thin client by emulating a thin
client.  It really isn't a thin client but it behaves like one.
Another type looks just like a text-terminal.  It just looks like a
monitor, with a connector for a keyboard and another connector for a
network cable.  It's a dedicated thin client and can't be used for
anything else.  The third type looks like a tiny computer.  It uses a
standard PC monitor and keyboard both of which plug into a small box
which is a "thin" computer.  This box provides an interface between
the monitor/keyboard and the network.
<P>
<H3>History and the future</H3>

<P> Promoters of NCs and related Window-Terminals projected that they
would soon replace millions of PCs.  In 1998 about 700,000 thin
clients were sold with about 27% of them being NCs.  But in 1999 only
about 600,000 thin clients were sold.  A major reason that more were
not sold is that PCs have come down in price in recent years so that
they are often no more expensive.  However, it's argued that even
though thin clients may cost the same as PCs, the maintenance and
administration costs are less.  Note that thin clients sometimes
replace text terminals instead of PCs.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Emulation on a PC</A>
</H2>

<P> Since a PC has a screen and keyboard (as does a terminal) but also
has much more computing power, it's easy to use some of this computing
power to make the PC computer behave like a text terminal.  This is
called "terminal emulation".  They usually emulate text-terminals.
