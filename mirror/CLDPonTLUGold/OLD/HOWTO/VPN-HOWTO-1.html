<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Why I wrote this HOWTO</A>
                        </H2>

<P>I work Real Networks, and we needed VPN service.  This was my first real
project, and I truly learned more about Linux with this than with any
other task.  I ended up using my experience with that project to write
this document, to share with others what I learned, so that they can do
ultra-nifty things with Linux too!
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Acknowledgements and Thanks</A>
                        </H2>

<P>I want to first and foremost thank my wife Julie, without her, I
wouldn't be where I am today.  I also want to thank Arpad Magosanyi, the
author of the first VPN mini-howto and pty-redir, the utility that makes
all of this possible.  Jerry, Rod, Glen, Mark V., Mark W., and David, You
guys rock!  Thanks for all your help.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Document History</A>
                        </H2>

<P>The original VPN mini-HOWTO was written by 
<A HREF="mag@bunuel.tii.matav.hu">Arpad Magosanyi</A> in 1997.  He has
since allowed me to take up the document and extend it into a full
HOWTO.  All of this would not be possible without his original document.
Thanks again Arpad. :)
<P>Version 1.0 of this HOWTO was completed on December 10, 1999.
