<H2><A NAME="s9">9. FAQ: OpenGL/Mesa?</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 What is OpenGL?</A>
</H2>

<P>OpenGL is an immediate mode graphics programming API
originally developed by SGI based on their previous
proprietary Iris GL, and became in industry standard
several years ago. It is defined and maintained by
the Architectural Revision Board (ARB), an organization
that includes members as SGI, IBM, and DEC, and Microsoft.
<P>OpenGL provides a complete feature set for 2D and
3D graphics operations in a pipelined hardware
accelerated architecture for triangle and polygon
rendering. In a broader sense, OpenGL is a powerful
and generic toolset for hardware assisted computer
graphics. 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Where to get additional information on OpenGL?</A>
</H2>

<P>The official site for OpenGL maintained by the members
of the ARB, is
<A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/">www.opengl.org</A>,
<P>A most recommended site is Mark Kilgard's Gateway to OpenGL
Info at
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/opengl-links.html">reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/opengl-links.html</A>:
it provides pointers to book, online manual pages, GLUT,
GLE, Mesa, ports to several OS, tons of demos and tools.
<P>If you are interested in game programming using OpenGL,
there is the <CODE>OpenGL-GameDev-L@fatcity.com</CODE> at
<CODE>Listserv@fatcity.com</CODE>. Be warned, this is
a high traffic list with very technical content, and
you will probably prefer to use <CODE>procmail</CODE> to
handle the 100 messages per day coming in. You cut
down bandwidth using the
<CODE>SET OpenGL-GameDev-L DIGEST</CODE>
command. It is also
not appropriate if you are looking for introductions.
The archive is handled by the ListServ software, use
the
<CODE>INDEX OpenGL-GameDev-L</CODE>
and
<CODE>GET OpenGL-GameDev-L "filename"</CODE>
commands to get a preview before subscribing.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Is Glide an OpenGL implementation?</A>
</H2>

<P>No, Glide is a proprietary 3Dfx API which several features
specific to the Voodoo Graphics (tm) and Voodoo Rush (tm). A 3Dfx OpenGL is
in preparation (see below). Several Glide features would require
EXTensions to OpenGL, some of which already found in other
implementations (e.g. paletted textures).
<P>The closest thing to a hardware accelerated Linux OpenGL
you could currently get is Brian Paul's Mesa
along with David Bucciarelli's Mesa Voodoo driver (see below). 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Is there an OpenGL driver from 3Dfx?</A>
</H2>

<P>Both the 3Dfx website and the Quantum3D website
announced OpenGL for Voodoo Graphics (tm) to be available 4Q97.
The driver is currently in Beta, and accessible only
to registered deverloper's under written Beta test
agreement.
<P>A linux port has not been announced yet.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5 Is there a commercial OpenGL for Linux and 3Dfx?</A>
</H2>

<P>I am not aware of any third party commercial OpenGL
that supports the Voodoo Graphics (tm). Last time I paid attention,
neither MetroX nor XInside OpenGL did. 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.6">9.6 What is Mesa?</A>
</H2>

<P>Mesa is a free implementation of the OpenGL API, designed
and written by Brian Paul, with contributions from many
others. Its performance is competitive, and while it
is not officially certified, it is an almost fully
compliant OpenGL implementation conforming to the ARB
specifications - more complete than some commercial
products out, actually.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.7">9.7 Does Mesa work with 3Dfx?</A>
</H2>

<P>The latest Mesa MesaVer; release works with
Linux Glide 2.4. In fact, support was included
in earlier versions, however, this driver is still under
development, so be prepared for bugs and less than optimal
performance. It is steadily improving, though, and bugs
are usually fixed very fast.
<P>You will need to get the Mesa library archive
from the
<A HREF="ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/">iris.ssec.wisc.edu FTP site</A>.
It is recommended to subscribe to the mailing list
as well, especially when trying to track down bugs,
hardware, or driver limitations. Make sure to get
the most recent distribution. A Mesa-3.0 is in
preparation.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.8">9.8 How portable is Mesa with Glide?</A>
</H2>

<P>It is available for Linux and Win32, and any application
based on Mesa will only have the usual system specific
code, which should usually mean XWindows vs. Windows,
or GLX vs. WGL. If you use e.g. GLUT or Qt, you should
get away with any system specifics at all for virtually
most
applications. There are only a few issues (like sampling
relative mouse movement) that are not adressed by the
available portable GUI toolkits.
<P>Mesa/Glide is also available for DOS. The port
which is 32bit DOS is maintained by Charlie Wallace
and kept up to date with the main Mesa base. See
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/~charlie_x/">www.geocities.com/~charlie_x/</A>.for the 
most current releases.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.9">9.9 Where to get info on Mesa?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Mesa home page is at
<A HREF="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html">www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html</A>.
There is an archive of the Mesa mailing list. 
at 
<A HREF="http://www.iqm.unicamp.br/mesa/">www.iqm.unicamp.br/mesa/</A>. This list is
not specific to 3Dfx and Glide, but if
you are interested in using 3Dfx hardware
to accelerate Mesa, it is a good place to
start.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.10">9.10 Where to get information on Mesa Voodoo?</A>
</H2>

<P>For latest information on the Mesa Voodoo driver
maintained by David Bucciarelli
<A HREF="mailto:tech.hmw@plus.it">tech.hmw@plus.it</A>
see the home page at
<A HREF="http://www-hmw.caribel.pisa.it/fxmesa/index.shtml">www-hmw.caribel.pisa.it/fxmesa/</A>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.11">9.11 Does Mesa support multitexturing?</A>
</H2>

<P>Not yet (as of Mesa 2.6), but it is on the list.
In Mesa you will probably have to use the OpenGL
<CODE>EXT_multitexture</CODE> extension once it is
available. There is no final specification for
multitextures in OpenGL, which is supposed to be
part of the upcoming OpenGL 1.2 revision. There might
be a Glide driver specific implementation of
the extension in upcoming Mesa releases, but as
long as only certain Quantum3D Obsidian boards come
with multiple TMU's, it is not a top priority. This
will surely change once Voodoo 2 (tm) based boards are in
widespread use.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.12">9.12 Does Mesa support single pass trilinear mipmapping?</A>
</H2>

<P>Multiple TMU's should be used for single pass
trilinear mipmapping for improvement image
quality without performance penalty in current
Linux Glide already. Mesa support is not
yet done (as of Mesa 2.6), but is in
preparation.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.13">9.13 What is the Mesa "Window Hack"?</A>
</H2>

<P>The most recent revisions of Mesa contain an experimental
feature for Linux XFree86. Basically, the GLX emulation
used by Mesa copies the contents of the Voodoo Graphics (tm) board's
most recently finished framebuffer content into video
memory on each <CODE>glXSwapBuffers</CODE> call. This feature
is also available with Mesa for Windows.
<P>This obviously puts some drain on the PCI, doubled by
the fact that this uses X11 MIT SHM, not XFree86 DGA
to access the video memory. The same approach could
theoretically be used with e.g. SVGA. The major benefit
is that you could use a Voodoo Graphics (tm) board for accelerated
rendering into a window, and that you don't have to
use the VGA passthrough mode (video output
of the VGA board deteoriates in passing through,
which is very visible with high end monitors like 
e.g. EIZO F784-T).
<P>Note that this experimental feature is <EM>NOT</EM>
Voodoo Rush (tm) support by any means. It applies only
to the Voodoo Graphics (tm) based boards. Moreover, you need to
use a modified GLUT, as interfacing the window
management system and handling the events appropriately
has to be done by the application, it is not handled
in the driver.
<P>Make really sure that you have enabled the 
following environment variables:
<HR>
<PRE>
export SST_VGA_PASS=1          # to stop video signal switching
export SST_NOSHUTDOWN=1        # to stop video signal switching
export MESA_GLX_FX="window"    # to initiate Mesa window mode
</PRE>
<HR>

If you manage to forget one of the SST variables, your
VGA board will be shut off, and you will loose the
display (but not the actual X). It is pretty hard to
get that back being effectively blind.
<P>Finally, note that the libMesaGL.a (or .so) library can contain
multiple client interfaces.  I.e. the GLX, OSMesa, and fxMesa
(and even SVGAMesa) interfaces call all be compiled into the
same libMesaGL.a. The client program can use any of them freely,
even simultaneously if it's careful.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.14">9.14 How about GLUT?</A>
</H2>

<P>Mark Kilgard's GLUT distribution is a very good place to
get sample applications plus a lot of useful utilities.
You will find it at
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/glut3/glut3.html">reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/glut3/</A>,
and you should get it anyway. The current release is
GLUT 3.6, and discussion on a GLUT 3.7 (aka GameGLUT)
has begun. Note that Mark Kilgard has left SGI recently,
so the archive might move some time this year - for the
time being it will be kept at SGI.
<P>There is also a GLUT mailing list,
<CODE>glut@perp.com</CODE>. Send mail to 
<A HREF="mailto:Majordomo@perp.com">majordomo@perp.com</A>,
with the (on of the) following
in the body of your email message:
<HR>
<PRE>
   help
   info glut
   subscribe glut
   end
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>As GLUT handles double buffers, windows, events,
and other operations closely tied to hardware and operating
system, using GLUT with Voodoo Graphics (tm) requires support, which
is currently in development within GLX for Mesa. It 
already works for most cases.
