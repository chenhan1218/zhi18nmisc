<P>Commercial databases pay many taxes like federal, state, sales, employment,
social security, medicare taxes, health care for employees, bunch of benefits 
for employees, marketing and advertisement costs. All these costs do not go
directly for the development of the database and do not improve the quality or
technology of the database. When you buy a commercial database,
some portion of the amount goes for overheads like taxes, expenses and balance
for database R&amp;D costs. 
<P>Also commercial databases have to pay for buildings/real-estates and 
purchase Unix machines, install and maintain them. All of these costs 
are passed onto customers.
<P>PostgreSQL has the advantage over commercial databases as there is no direct
taxes since it is made on the internet. A very vast group of people contribute 
to the development of the PostgreSQL. For example, in a hypothetical case, if
there are one million companies in U.S.A and each contribute about $ 10
(worth of software to PostgreSQL) then each and every company will get ten 
million dollars!! This is the <B>GREAT MAGIC</B> of software development on internet.
<P>Currently, PostgreSQL source code is 
about 2,50,000 lines of "C", "C++" code. If cost of each line of "C" code 
is $ 2 then the PostgreSQL is worth about 
$ 5,00,000 (half a million dollars!).
<P>Many companies already develop in-house vast amount of "C", "C++" code. Hence 
by taking in the source code of PostgreSQL and collaborating with other 
companies on internet will greatly benefit the company saving time and efforts.
