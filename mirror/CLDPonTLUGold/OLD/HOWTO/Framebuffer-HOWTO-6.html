 8 bits |         ttlow                   vga256
</PRE>
<P><CODE>ttlow, ttmid and tthigh</CODE> are only used by the TT, whilst <CODE>vga2,
vga4, vga15, vga256, falh3 and falh16</CODE> are only used by the Falcon.
<P>When used with the kernel option <CODE>video=xxx</CODE>, and no suboption is
given, the kernel will probe for the modes in the following order until
it finds a mode that is possible with the given hardware:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>ttmid</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>tthigh</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>vga16</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>sthigh</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>stmid</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>You may specify the particular mode you wish to use, if you don't wish to
auto-probe for the modes you desire. For example, <CODE>video=vga16</CODE> gives
you a 4 bit 640x480 display.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Additional suboptions on Atari m68k platforms</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are a number of suboptions available with the <CODE>video=xxx</CODE>
parameter:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>inverse</CODE> - inverts the display so that the background/foreground
colours are reversed. Normally the background is black, but with this
suboption, it gets sets to white.</LI>
<LI><CODE>font</CODE> - sets the font to use in text modes. Currently you can
only select <CODE>VGA8x8</CODE>, <CODE>VGA8x16</CODE>, <CODE>PEARL8x8</CODE>. The default is to
use the <CODE>VGA8x8</CODE> only if the vertical size of the display is less than
400 pixels, otherwise it defaults to <CODE>VGA8x16</CODE>.</LI>
<LI><CODE>internal</CODE> - a very interesting option. See the next section for
information.</LI>
<LI><CODE>external</CODE> - as above.</LI>
<LI><CODE>monitorcap</CODE> - describes the capabilities for multisyncs. DON'T
use with a fixed sync monitor! </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Using the internal suboption on Atari m68k platforms</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Syntax: <CODE>internal:(xres);(yres)[;(xres_max);(yres_max);(offset)]</CODE>
<P>This option specifies the capabilities of some extended internal video
hardware, i.e OverScan modes. <CODE>(xres)</CODE> and <CODE>(yres)</CODE> gives the
extended dimensions of the screen.
<P>If your OverScan mode needs a black border, you'll need to write the last
three arguments of the <CODE>internal:</CODE> suboption. <CODE>(xres_max)</CODE> is the
maximum line length that the hardware allows, <CODE>(yres_max)</CODE> is the
maximum number of lines, and <CODE>(offset)</CODE> is the offset of the visible
part of the screen memory to its physical start, in bytes.
<P>Often extended internal video hardware has to be activated, for this you
will need the <CODE>"switches=*"</CODE> options. [Note: Author would like extra
information on this, please. The m68k documentation in the kernel isn't
clear enough on this point, and he doesn't have an Atari! Examples would
be helpful too]
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Using the external suboption on Atari m68k platforms</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Syntax:
<CODE>external:(xres);(yres);(depth);(org);(scrmem)[;(scrlen)[;(vgabase)[;(colw)[;(coltype)[;(xres_virtual)]]]]]</CODE>
<P>This is quite complicated, so this document will attempt to explain as
clearly as possible, but the Author would appreciate if someone would give
this a look over and see that he hasn't fscked something up! :o)
<P>This suboption specifies that you have an external video hardware (most
likely a graphic board), and how to use it with Linux. The kernel is
basically limited to what it knows of the internal video hardware, so you
have to supply the parameters it needs in order to be able to use external
video hardware. There are two limitations; you must switch to that mode
before booting, and once booted, you can't change modes. 
<P>The first three parameters are obvious; gives the dimensions of the screen
as pixel height, width and depth. The depth supplied should be the number
of colours is 2^n that of the number of planes required. For example, if
you desire to use a 256 colour display, then you need to give 8 as the
depth. This depends on the external graphic hardware, though so you will
be limited by what the hardware can do. 
<P>Following from this, you also need to tell the kernel how the video memory
is organised - supply a letter as the <CODE>(org)</CODE> parameter
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>n</CODE> - use normal planes, i.e one whole plane after another</LI>
<LI><CODE>i</CODE> - use interleaved planes, i.e. 16 bits of the first plane,
then the 16 bits of the next plane and so on. Only built-in Atari video
modes uses this - and there are no graphic card that supports this mode. </LI>
<LI><CODE>p</CODE> - use packed pixels, i.e consecutive bits stands for all
planes for a pixel. This is the most common mode for 256 colour displays
on graphic cards.</LI>
<LI><CODE>t</CODE> - use true colour, i.e this is actually packed pixels, but
does not require a colour lookup table like what other packed pixel modes
uses. These modes are normally 24 bit displays - gives you 16.8 million
colours. </LI>
</UL>
<P><EM>However</EM>, for monochrome modes, the <CODE>(org)</CODE> parameter has a
different meaning
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>n</CODE> - use normal colours, i.e 0=white, 1=black</LI>
<LI><CODE>i</CODE> - use inverted colours, i.e. 0=black, 1=white</LI>
</UL>
<P>The next important item about the video hardware is the base address of
the video memory. That is given by the <CODE>(scrmem)</CODE> parameter as a
hexadecimal number with an <CODE>0x</CODE> prefix. You will need to find this out
from the documentation that comes with your external video hardware.
<P>The next paramter <CODE>(scrlen)</CODE> tells the kernel about the size of the
video memory. If it's missing, this is calculated from the <CODE>(xres)</CODE>,
<CODE>(yres)</CODE> and <CODE>(depth)</CODE> parameters. It's not useful to write a value
here these days anyway. To leave this empty, give two consecutive
semicolons if you need to give the <CODE>(vgabase)</CODE> parameter, otherwise,
just leave it.
<P>The <CODE>(vgabase)</CODE> parameter is optional. If it isn't given, the kernel
can't read/write any colour registers of the video hardware, and thus you
have to set up the appropriate colours before you boot Linux. But if your
card is VGA compatible, you can give it the address where it can locate
the VGA register set so it can change the colour lookup tables. This
information can be found in your external video hardware documentation. To
make this <EM>clear</EM>, <CODE>(vgabase)</CODE> is the <EM>base</EM> address, i.e a 4k
aligned address. For reading/writing the colour registers, the kernel uses
the address range between <CODE>(vgabase) + 0x3c7</CODE> and <CODE>(vgabase) +
0x3c9</CODE>. This parameter is given in hexadecimal and must have a <CODE>0x</CODE>
prefix, just like <CODE>(scrmem)</CODE>.
<P><CODE>(colw)</CODE> is only meaningful, if the <CODE>(vgabase)</CODE> parameter is
specified. It tells the kernel how wide each of the colour register is,
i.e the number of bits per single colour (red/green/blue). Default is
usually 6 bits, but it is also common to specify 8 bits.
<P><CODE>(coltype)</CODE> is used with the <CODE>(vgabase)</CODE> parameter, it tells the
kernel about the colour register model of your graphic board. Currently
the types supported are <CODE>vga</CODE> and <CODE>mv300</CODE>. <CODE>vga</CODE> is the default.
<P><CODE>(xres_virtual)</CODE> is only required for the ProMST/ET4000 cards where the
physical linelength differs from the visible length. With ProMST, you need
to supply 2048, whilst for ET4000, it depends on the initialisation of the
video board.
