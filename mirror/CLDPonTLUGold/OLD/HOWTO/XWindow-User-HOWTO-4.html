<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Working In X</A></H2>

<P>In this section we will become familiar with running clients in X
Window and the basic procedures involved in using the system. X is not
an
intuitive interface on its own, and without any window manager, it is
easiest to use as a display for programs started from the command
line. One of the most common uses for X is just to have several xterm
windows open at the same time. Not exactly maxing out the graphics
capabilities of the computer, but it's a nice feature to start with.
<P>The flexibility and usefulness of the command line is so great, in
fact, that you don't really need a window manager. It's nice, and you
will want it very quickly, but the fact is that you can get by
without one, just the command line and the mouse. If you give it a
shot, you'll be surprised as to the exact distinctions between the
clients and the window manager. If you start toying around with this,
however, <EM>remember</EM> that the key combination Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
gets
you out of X Window in a pinch.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Command Line Options</A>
</H2>

<P>Most X programs try to use the same basic names for command line
options.  All applications written using the MIT X Toolkit Intrinsics
automatically accept the following options:
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>-display <EM>display</EM></B><DD><P>This option specifies the X server
to use. See the section on Display Names for details.
<P>
<DT><B>-geometry <EM>geometry</EM></B><DD><P>The initial size and location of
the window, in a format such as
<EM>width</EM>x<EM>height</EM>+<EM>hoffset</EM>+<EM>voffset</EM> or
+<EM>hoffset</EM>-<EM>voffset</EM>. Note that if you put in a
negative horizontal or vertical offset, the window will be placed
counting backward from the right or the bottom of the screen,
respectively.
<P>
<DT><B>-font <EM>font</EM></B><DD><P>The font to use for displaying the text
in your window.
<P>
<DT><B>-bg <EM>color</EM></B><DD><P>The color to use for the window
background.
<P>
<DT><B>-fg <EM>color</EM></B><DD><P>The color to use for the window
foreground.
<P>
<DT><B>-name <EM>resource-name</EM></B><DD><P>Useful for specifying the name
under which the resources for this application will be found. This is
useful to distinguish between invocations of the same application,
for example, two <B>xterm</B>s can be named differently so that
they may inherit different resources based upon those names in the
resource database.
<P>
<DT><B>-title <EM>string</EM></B><DD><P>This is the title to be used for the
window on your display, generally used by the window manager to put a
descriptive title at the top of the window. Not to be confused with
the <B>-name</B> option.
<P>
<DT><B>-iconic</B><DD><P>Invoke window as an icon.
<P>
<DT><B>-xrm <EM>resource-string</EM></B><DD><P>This option specifies a
resource name and value to override any defaults that may already be
set. Also useful for setting X resources that do not have explicit
command line options. For instance, the command line <CODE>xterm -xrm
&quot;xterm*background: blue&quot;</CODE> is functionally identical to
typing <CODE>xterm -bg blue</CODE>.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Display Names</A>
</H2>

<P>Every X Server has a display name of the form:
<P><EM>hostname:displaynumber.screennumber</EM>
<P>The <EM>hostname</EM> specifies the name of the machine to which the
display is actually, physically connected. The <EM>hostname</EM> can
be omitted, and if so, the server on the same machine will be
chosen. In fact, if you are the only one using X on your computer,
you will want to just leave this off of your display
specifications. The <EM>displaynumber</EM> should probably be zero,
this is used if the X Server is controlling more than one keyboard
and monitor unit, for instance, a network of X terminals. The
<EM>screennumber</EM> specifies which monitor in a multiple monitor
setup should be used. Following this specification, you would open an
<B>xterm</B> window on your local machine with the option
<B>-display :0.0</B>. You can see that we have omitted the
<EM>hostname</EM> from the option, so the current machine is assumed.
<P>On Linux systems, your <EM>DISPLAY</EM> variable holds your display
name, which on my system is <B>:0.0</B>. This is usually set by
<B>xterm</B>, or one of the scripts that starts X Window for you,
although you can set it yourself, or as discussed above, use the
<B>-display</B> command line option when invoking your application.
<P>If you have opened an <B>xterm</B> or <B>rxvt</B> window, and then
opted to do super-user work via the <CODE>su</CODE> command, you will find
that if you try to launch an X application you will have no display to
launch it on. Silly it seems, because you are sitting right in front of
your display, but the trick to getting this to work is to pass an
option
on the command line to the program such as <CODE>-display :0.0</CODE>, and
it
will work fine.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 XTerm Versus Rxvt, or, Know Thy Terminal Emulator</A>
</H2>

<P>Your choice of <B>terminal emulator</B> can affect your experience
in 
X almost as much as your window manager, so a little discussion of your
best options is due here. A terminal emulator is a program such as
<B>xterm</B>, discussed above, which lets you emulate the simple
console 
of Linux in X. You will rely heavily on the program you choose, so it
pays to choose it wisely to begin with.
<P>If you have a slow video card, the first thing you should consider doing
is switching to <B>rxvt</B>. Using <B>xterm</B> is a good starting
point, mainly because it comes standard with all X distributions, but
it's 
not always the best choice. It contains a lot of legacy code, and is
quite bloated for a simple terminal emulator. This is partly due to the
fact that it's not just a plain text terminal emulator, but also
emulates
graphics modes that you simply will never use. Because of this, you may
wish to switch to <B>rxvt</B>, and also because <B>xterm</B> can be
extremely slow. I'm not sure why it's so slow, but if you have a slow
video card you'll know what I mean, and you'll be amazed at the
difference 
when you dump <B>xterm</B>.
<P>Some other perks of <B>rxvt</B> include pixmap backgrounds, and a much
nicer scrollbar. If you specify the <CODE>-pixmap</CODE> option on the
command line (and have support compiled in to your version!) you will
get
any <CODE>.xpm</CODE>-type picture in the background. A very cool feature,
and it surprisingly doesn't slow down your output at all, it still
redraws 
faster than your <B>xterm</B> window. Give it a shot, I haven't seen
it 
around lately but I think it can be found on metalab.
