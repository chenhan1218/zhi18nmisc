<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Choosing a Window Manager</A></H2>

<P>This is a discussion of the window managers available to the X
Window user, with a comparison of some finer ones to choose from. In
order to prevent this document from becoming overwhelmingly large
(and proportionally difficult to maintain, as well) I am limiting the
discussion to the more popular and well known window managers out
there. I believe these are most representative for our purposes, and
once you grasp the basic concepts of a few, you more or less will
have the hang of them all.
<P>Your choice of window manager can dramatically influence how pleasant
your computing experience will be. You spend much of your time
dealing with windows when you're in X, and you don't want something
that's too obtrusive, one that will get in your way. Some window
managers are extremely customizable, to the point that you can pretty
much feel like it's a new operating system. If you don't like icons,
get rid of them! If you miss that toolbar, you can build a better
one, and it can be a pretty painless and rewarding process besides.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 FVWM And Its Ancestors</A>
</H2>

<P>The most common window managers nowadays have their roots in Robert
Nation's FVWM window manager. These include FVWM, FVWM2, FVWM95, and
many
more. FVWM itself is derived partly from TWM, which comes with an X
Window installation, but which we will not cover here.  The syntax and
usage of TWM is similar to FVWM, but it actually uses more memory, and
feels clumsy and awkward to most users.
<P>FVWM is the original and old standby favorite Linux window manager. Now
that the 2.0 of versions of FVWM have become stable and in more general
usage, this newer version is preferred, for the syntax is much more
direct and simplified, and much more flexible as well. However, many
people still have the original FVWM on their systems, as it has been a
long
time favorite and standard, and most of the examples in this text are
equally applicable to this older version. And if the older one is
working
fine for you, there may be no need to upgrade, since it may break your
configuration files to some degree, for some of the syntax has indeed
changed, and is not altogether backward compatible. Such is the nature
of
progress.
<P>Nobody seems quite sure what F in FVWM stands for (not even the author,
from what I can tell!), but the VWM would seem to (correctly) indicate
Virtual Window Manager, and indeed the FVWM series are virtual window
managers, and that is one of their strengths. You can bind keys to any
function, including the switching between the virtual desktops, and do
this with ease.
<P><B>FVWM2</B> is the new standard, including many improvements and
features not found in the previous version. Unlike many newer window
managers, it works just fine on 8-bit, 256 color displays, which I am
using at the moment, and still can be improved with little icons and
gradients, to look as much like the Win98 interface as you may or may
not
want. This version is also much more extensible in general, and allows
the use of themes and dynamic menus. Technically, FVWM2 is still in
beta,
but it works just great, and I have not yet had a single problem with
it.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 The Wide World of Window Systems</A>
</H2>

<P>For users more familiar with other window environments on other
operating systems, there are plenty of window managers to emulate the
desktop you're accustomed to.
<P>The 
<A HREF="http://berta.fri.uni-lj.si/~markom/icewm">icewm</A>
window manager is aimed at a more consistent look and feel, and can
emulate many other windowing system standards, hot key bindings, and
such.
The OS/2 emulations are particularly nice.
<A HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~marcus/amiwm.html">AmiWM</A> is an Amiga Workbench type window manager, 
<A HREF="http://www.bioele.nuee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/member/tak/mlvwm.html">mlvwm</A> is a MacOS emulator. A nice addition to these window
managers is 
<A HREF="http://www-c.informatik.uni-hannover.de/~kaiser/dfm/dfm.html">dfm</A>, a desktop and file manager that pleasantly resembles the
OS/2 Workplace Shell.

other windowing environments. Many more still are listed at

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 The X Graphical Interfaces</A>
</H2>

<P>Open Look and Motif were early attempts to standardize X Window,
and make it usable in more mainstream environments, around a greater
variety of workstations. Both were somewhat successful at those
attempts (in look and feel, if not politically) and can be used under
a modern Linux system.  Both require specific libraries, which can be
used to compile a variety of applications specifically designed for one
or the other environment, to give all programs a similar look and feel.
<P>Starting with X11 Release 5, Sun Microsystem's <B>OpenWindows</B>
graphical interface was available to X users. This includes two
versions
of the Open Look Window Manager, <EM>olwm</EM> and <EM>olvwm</EM> (with
a virtual desktop). This was developed by Sun in hopes of making a
standard windowing environment, and indeed it was standard with Solaris
for many years.  If your distribution of Linux did not come with this
windowing system installed, you must remember to install the
<EM>XView</EM> libraries to get it to work, and you will also have to
put
the <EM>/usr/openwin/...</EM> directories in your search path.
<P>If you want the actual <B>OSF/Motif Toolkit</B> for Linux, you'll have
to pay, the programs and toolkit are not free. However, the <EM>Hungry
Programmers</EM> have written <B>LessTif</B>, which allows you to
compile Motif programs more or less as if you owned to toolkit. LessTif
is a clone of the Motif toolkit. Currently LessTif is partially
implemented with most of the API in place. Many programs already work
under this free version of the toolkit, and it even comes with a window
manager, derived from FVWM code, which you'd swear was the Motif Window
Manager.
<P>The most useful feature of this toolkit, however, is compiling programs
dependent on having a Motif library on your system. The window manager
is
nothing spectacular, and mostly useful if you're migrating from the
original Motif, and want to keep your configuration file. For all
intents
and purposes, you will find FVWM much more feature-filled and useful,
and
it looks and behaves almost identically, even recognizing the window
hints supplied by programs built with the Motif toolkit.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 The X Desktop Environments</A>
</H2>

<P>The second generation of Linux window managers was brought about by
KDE, and soon joined by GNOME. There are some striking similarities,
and some great differences, between these two, and I will attempt to
cover them here. The most important thing to remember at this point
is that neither of them is in any way a complete product. Both are at
the start of a long development cycle, and not completely stable yet,
and
as such are not suited to mission-critical work at this time.
<P><B>The KDE Desktop Environment</B>
<P>(A quote from the home page:) <EM>``KDE is a completely new desktop,
incorporating a large suite of applications for Unix
workstations. While KDE includes a window manager, file manager,
panel, control center and many other components that one would expect
to be part of a contemporary desktop environment, the true strength
of this exceptional environment lies in the interoperability of its
components.''</EM>
<P>The KDE Desktop Environment is an attempt to make a desktop
environment, not just a window manager. The tools of KDE work
together so well, for instance, one might be fooled into thinking KDE
was an entire operating system. All the tools to work in a windowing
system are included, and many more have been ported to the KDE
environment. KDE has achieved a surprising level of maturity already,
but many are reluctant to install it on their desktop, because of the
licensing stipulations of the QT toolkit, upon which KDE is based. This
has changed a little lately, and the licence now qualifies as Open
Source 
by definition, but is not the same as that of GNU software.
<P>For those just looking to get down to business, KDE is often the way to
go.  This project has been around for some time now, and has let go of
some flashiness for the ability to get lots done.  In many ways you can
become fooled into thinking you're using a product strikingly similar
to the good parts of Windows.  Which can be a good thing.  But it can
also be somewhat frustrating, and one longs after a while for something
a little different from the paradigm upon which KDE is firmly based.
<P><B>GNOME: The GNU Object Model Environment</B>
<P>(A quote from the home page:) <EM>``GNOME stands for GNU Network
Object Model Environment. The GNOME project intends to build a
complete, user-friendly desktop based entirely on free
software. GNOME is part of the GNU project, and GNOME is part of the
OpenSource(tm) movement. The desktop will consist of small utilities
and larger applications which share a consistent look and feel. GNOME
uses GTK+ as the GUI toolkit for all GNOME-compliant
applications.''</EM>
<P>The GNOME project is an attempt to do much of the same work as KDE,
but even a little more than that. GNOME is less tied to one window
manager, for instance, and it is interoperable not just between
applications, but computers and platforms, as it uses the Common
Object Resource Broker Architecture (CORBA).  Also, and to many most
importantly, GNOME is based on the GTk+ toolkit, which is free and
open source, unlike the underlying toolkit of KDE, thereby following
in the philosophy of Linux itself.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 The Flashy Window Managers</A>
</H2>

<P>The latest generation of window manger is very very pretty
indeed. Sporting every convenience you could think of, and emulating
the most beautiful operating systems ever used on the most gorgeous
workstations in the world, these are the window managers to run if
you've got the memory and CPU cycles to burn.
<P><B>Window Maker</B>
<P>(A quote from the home page:) <EM>``Window Maker is an X11 window
manager designed to give additional integration support for GNUstep
applications. It tries to emulate the elegant look and feel of the
NEXTSTEP(tm) GUI. It is relatively fast, feature rich, and easy to
configure and use.''</EM>
<P>A big strength of this window manager is that it supports the GNU
desktop, meaning that it makes a great and very pretty front-end to
GNOME. This is also one of the most easily configurable window
managers, and can be configured from a graphical interface, and
supports the OffiX drag and drop protocol, easy switching of desktop
themes, and it's now available within the popular Red Hat
distribution, so it's easy and painless to switch from FVWM when the
mood finally strikes. As of the 0.50 release, Window Maker supports KDE
compliance as well.
<P><B>AfterStep</B>
<P>(A quote from the home page:) <EM>``AfterStep is a Window Manager
for X which started by emulating the NEXTSTEP look and feel, but
which has been significantly altered according to the requests of
various users. Many adepts will tell you that NEXTSTEP is not only
the most visually pleasant interface, but also one of the most
functional and intuitive out there. AfterStep aims to incorporate the
advantages of the NEXTSTEP interface, and add additional useful
features.  The developers of AfterStep have also worked very hard to
ensure stability and a small program footprint.''</EM>
<P><B>Enlightenment</B>
<P>Enlightenment is more than just a window manager, it is an extreme,
detailed, and configurable environment, and is particularly
attractive in that it allows irregular and completely customizable
window shapes. It is open in design, and instead of dictating a
policy it allows the user to define their own policy right down to
the minute and infinitesimal details; from its functionality right on
through to its looks.
<P>If you are using GNOME, you will find that Enlightenment is the default
window manager, and in fact, it must be installed for GNOME to
function.  It is also basically the de facto implementation of the
GNOME features for integration, making it the most practical choice
for a desktop in that situation.  Many other window managers will work
alright with GNOME, but you will find that Enlightement excels.
Unfortunately, it is still in development, and runs slowly and
imperfectly from time to time.
