<H2><A NAME="xfonts"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Making Fonts Available To X</A></H2>

<P>There are a number of ways fonts can be added to X. Firstly, XFree86
has a <EM>font path</EM> which is just a list of several directories
or <EM>font servers</EM> where it searches for fonts. A font server
is just a background process that makes fonts available to XFree86. 
An advantage of font servers is that they can send fonts to remote displays.
<P>Recently, <CODE>xfs</CODE> ( the ``X font server'' ) has been patched 
to support TrueType fonts, and run as a stand-alone program.  
The patched version ships with Redhat and Redhat-based distributions,
and is included in XFree86 3.9.17 ( the latest version at the time of 
writing. It will also be a part of XFree86 4.0 )
<CODE>xfs</CODE> is actually just the standard font server that comes
with XFree86. It's source code is part of the XFree86 source tree.
However, distributions have recently been shipping a version that runs
in stand alone mode.
The standalone X font server, with the TrueType support 
patch ( the TrueType support takes place via a font server 
called <CODE>xfsft</CODE> ) is probably the nicest font management 
solution currently available. Its advantages include:
<UL>
<LI>Support for different types of fonts, including Type1, TrueType
and bitmap.</LI>
<LI>Makes fonts available to remote displays.</LI>
<LI>Greatly simplifies editing the fontpath -- you can do it via
the command line utility <CODE>chkfontpath</CODE>, as opposed to
having to edit configuration files. This not only makes life
easier for users, it makes packaging more safer and more scriptable 
for packagers.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Because different distributions ship with different configurations,
it is not true that one size fits all. We can split users up into
three groups:
<UL>
<LI>Your distribution ships with a standalone <CODE>xfs</CODE>
and it has been patched to support TrueType. This group 
includes Redhat users and users of derivatives of Redhat 
such as Mandrake, TurboLinux, and Independence.
For this group, the wisest strategy is to install both TrueType
and Type1 fonts through <CODE>xfs</CODE></LI>
<LI>Some distributions ship with a stand alone <CODE>xfs</CODE>
package, but no TrueType support (at the time of writing.
Note that XFree86 supports TrueType as of version 3.9.17 ). 
This includes Debian. For these users, the best thing to do is use 
<CODE>xfs</CODE> to install Type1 fonts, and install TrueType
fonts via <CODE>xfstt</CODE>. Debian users can seek out 
the 
<A HREF="http://www.dimensional.com/~bgiles/debian-tt.html">TrueType Fonts in Debian mini-HOWTO</A>
for information about installing TrueType fonts in Debian.</LI>
<LI>If you don't have <CODE>xfs</CODE> then you will need to install
Type1 fonts by adding to their XFree86 font path and
using xset. You should install TrueType 
via <CODE>xfstt</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="fontpath"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 The font path </A>
</H2>

<P>XFree86 finds your fonts by searching a <EM>font path</EM>,
a list of directories ( or servers -- we'll explain this 
further later. ) containing fonts.
When an application requests a font, it searches through 
the directories in your font path one at a time until the font
is found.
To make fonts available requires you to set your font path.
You can add a directory to your font path with the command
<A NAME="xset"></A> 
<PRE>
        xset fp+ directory
        
</PRE>

Once you have done this, you need to ask the X server to re-scan 
for available fonts with the command 
<PRE>
        xset fp rehash
        
</PRE>

Since you will want these commands to run automatically, you should
put them in your <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> file ( or possibly your 
<CODE>.Xclients</CODE> or <CODE>.xsession</CODE> file -- this depends on 
how you start X. It's convenient to make two of these files symlinks
to the other to avoid confusion ).
Another way to have the commands  set automatically is edit XF86Config.
For example, to add <CODE>/usr/share/fonts/myfonts</CODE> to the fontpath
when X is started, edit <CODE>XF86Config</CODE> like this:
<PRE>
                ...
                Section "Files"
                ...
                
                FontPath /usr/share/fonts/myfonts
                ...
                EndSection
                ...
</PRE>

The advantage of editing XF86Config is that the resulting changes 
are system wide.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Installing Type1 Fonts</A>
</H2>

<H3>Run Type1inst</H3>

<P>The easiest way to make Type1 fonts available to X is with the
help of the Type1inst utility. This is a perlscript that automatically
creates the fonts.dir and fonts.scale files that you need for X
to use the fonts. Simply CD to the directory, and run type1inst.
<PRE>
        cd directory
        type1inst
        
</PRE>
<H3>If You Have the <CODE>xfs</CODE> Package</H3>

<P>Now you need to add the fonts to your fontpath. If you already 
have the standalone 
<A HREF="#xfs">xfs</A> running, you do this 
by editing your <CODE>xfs</CODE> configuration file.
<EM> 
Redhat users can just use 
<A HREF="#chkfontpath">chkfontpath</A>.
the format is </EM>
<CODE>chkfontpath --add directory</CODE>
<P>Your fonts should now be available to X. Now you 
just run
<PRE>
        xset fp rehash
        
</PRE>

and X will be able to find the new fonts.
<P>
<H3>If You Don't Have The <CODE>xfs</CODE> Package</H3>

<P>In this case, you need to add the directory containing 
your new fonts to the font path, as described previously.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 True Type Fonts</A>
</H2>

<P>Adding TrueType fonts is a little more difficult, because you need 
to have a font server that is capable of serving TrueType fonts.
Two font servers that do this are xfstt and xfs.
<P><CODE>xfstt</CODE> is a TrueType font server. While it's easy to configure,
and quite useful, it appear that <CODE>xfs</CODE> is becoming more popular.
The main advantage of <CODE>xfs</CODE> over <CODE>xfstt</CODE> is that it supports
both Type1 and TrueType fonts.
<H3>xfstt</H3>

<P>To set up xfstt, just download it and install it. If you have an rpm
based distribution, there is a well packaged version of xfstt at
http://independence.seul.org/. 
Once you install it, you need to do the following:
<OL>
<LI>    
install fonts into the appropriate
directory ( read the documentation that comes with the package ).</LI>
<LI>cd to that directory and run <CODE>xfstt --sync</CODE>. This causes it
to look for the fonts and create the <CODE>fonts.dir</CODE> file. </LI>
<LI>Now add <CODE>unix/:7100</CODE> to your font path.</LI>
</OL>

Your TrueType fonts should now display and be available to applications
such as GIMP and Netscape.
You may want to configure it to start every time your system starts up.
Check to see if there's a startup file included ( if you are using 
RPM, you can use <CODE>rpm -ql xfstt |grep init</CODE> and look for the 
file with a name something like this: <CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/xfstt</CODE>
) 
If you don't have an init script, just
put two  lines in <CODE>/etc/rc.local</CODE> like this:
<PRE>
        /usr/X11R6/bin/xfstt --sync
        /usr/X11R6/bin/xfstt &amp;
        
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="xfs"></A> <A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 xfs</A>
</H2>

<P>Some of the newer Linux distributions ship with the X font server 
<CODE>xfs</CODE> configured to run as a stand alone program. 
Notably, Redhat and all the redhat based distributions use this 
modularised <CODE>xfs</CODE> with TrueType compiled in.
Debian also ship <CODE>xfs</CODE>, but the version 
they ship doesn't have built in true 
type support.
<P>Running <CODE>xfs</CODE> 
as a stand alone server has several benefits, especially 
if it is compiled with TrueType support. The main advantage is that since
the font server is no longer attached to the X server, it is possible
to serve fonts to remote displays. Also, it makes it much easier
to modify the font path.
<H3>The <CODE>xfs</CODE> Path</H3>

<P>As a font server, <CODE>xfs</CODE> has it's own font path. 
One might wonder where this fits into the picture. It
works like this: you can place the <CODE>xfs</CODE> font server
in XFree86's font path, by adding <CODE>unix/:port</CODE> to
the XFree86 font path.
Once you do this, any font in the <CODE>xfs</CODE> font path
automatically becomes available to XFree86.
<P>The <CODE>xfs</CODE> font path 
is determined by the <CODE>xfs</CODE> configuration file,
which is <CODE>/etc/X11/fs/config</CODE> on Redhat, and 
<CODE>/etc/X11/xfs/config</CODE> on Debian.
Redhat users do not need to explicitly edit this file, they 
can use the <CODE>chkfontpath</CODE> utility.
The syntax is simple:
<A NAME="chkfontpath"></A>  
<PRE>
        chkfontpath --add directory
        
</PRE>

Users of other distributions can edit the configuration file as 
follows:
<PRE>
        catalogue = /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
        ...
        /usr/share/fonts/my_new_fonts/,
        ...
        /usr/share/fonts/some_other_directory
        # in 12 points, decipoints
        default-point-size = 120
        ...
        
</PRE>

The above would add <CODE>/usr/share/fonts/my_new_fonts/</CODE> to the
<CODE>xfs</CODE> font path. <EM>Note that the last line of the list of 
directories doesn't have a comma at the end.</EM>
For these modifications to the font path to become effective, <CODE>xfs</CODE>
must be restarted. It's also a good idea to restart your 
X session after restarting
<CODE>xfs</CODE>.
<H3>Installing a Font Into <CODE>xfs</CODE></H3>

<P>To prepare a font for <CODE>xfs</CODE>, you need to follow the following 
steps:
<UL>
<LI>If you don't have xfs installed, you need to install it.</LI>
<LI>Put the new fonts in a directory.</LI>
<LI>If you are installing Type1 fonts,
prepare the new directory for the server 
by running <CODE>type1inst</CODE> in the directory.</LI>
<LI>If you are installing
TrueType fonts, ( <EM>remember, not all distributions can do TrueType via
xfs ! </EM> ), prepare the new directory for the server by running 
<PRE>
        ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale
        mkfontdir
        
</PRE>

in the directory containing your new fonts.
<CODE>ttmkfdir</CODE> is part of the <EM>freetype</EM> package.</LI>
<LI>Now you can add the new directory to your <CODE>xfs</CODE> search path. 
Users of Redhat-like distributions 
can do this with the <CODE>chkfontpath</CODE> utility:
Other users can do this by editing their <CODE>xfs</CODE> configuration
file.</LI>
<LI>if <CODE>xfs</CODE> is already installed on your system,
you should see which port it is running on. You can do this
as follows:
<PRE>
        ps ax|grep xfs
        
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Then check your XFree86 font path. 
<PRE>
                xset -q
        
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>If your font path includes something like <CODE>unix:/<EM>port_number</EM></CODE>
were <EM>port_number</EM> is the port which the server is running on, then
you already have xfs set up properly. Otherwise, you should add it to
your XFree86 font path.
<PRE>
                xset fp+ unix/:port_number
                xset fp rehash
        
</PRE>

You can add it permanently by editing your <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> as explained 
previously.
To add it system wide, edit your XF86Config file ( probably either 
<CODE>/etc/X11/XF86Config</CODE>, <CODE>/etc/XF86Config</CODE> or
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</CODE> ), by adding a 
line <CODE>FontPath "unix:/port_number"</CODE> in the Files section.
Here's an example:
<PRE>
                ...
                Section "Files"
                ...
                
                FontPath "unix/:-1" 
                ...
                EndSection
                ...
                
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>If <CODE>xfs</CODE> is already properly installed, then you can restart 
it like this:
<PRE>
                /etc/rc.d/init.d/xfs restart
                
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>After restarting <CODE>xfs</CODE>, it's a good idea to restart your
X-session.</LI>
